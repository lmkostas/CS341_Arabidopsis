PMC5341030	Protein sumoylation, characterized by the covalent conjugation of a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) protein to a lysine residue in a target protein, is a key post-translational modification in plants. Eight SUMO isoforms, SUMO18, are found in Arabidopsis, of which SUMO1/2 is the main conjugate1. Similar to ubiquitination, sumoylation requires an E1-E2-E3 enzyme cascade to catalyze the activation, conjugation and ligation processes23. The E1, a heterodimer, activates the SUMO by thioester formation4. In Arabidopsis, two redundant genes, SAE1A and SAE1B, encode the smaller subunit of E1, whereas the larger subunit is encoded by a single gene, SAE24. The E2, encoded by AtSCE1, transfers the SUMO from E1 to the lysine site of the substrate4. In some cases, the E2 is able to directly recognize not only the lysine located in the conical consensus sequence (KxE) but also other irregular lysine residues5. The E3 ligase functions as an additional platform that promotes the interaction between SUMO-charged E2 and targets6. SIZ1 and HPY2 were identified as functional E3 ligases for protein sumoylation in Arabidopsis78. Recently, two E4-type SUMO ligases, PIAL1 and PIAL2, were identified that catalyze SUMO chain formation9.. A wide range of environmental and developmental signals, such as abiotic stresses71011, the innate immune response12, hormones13, flowering4, and meristem maintenance8, are coupled with massive and rapid changes of sumoylation in Arabidopsis. In the abscisic acid (ABA) response, sumoylation of ABI5 by SIZ1 increases its stability and negatively regulates seed germination and inhibits primary root growth14. Sumoylation of MYB30, which functions in parallel with the ABI5-mediated ABA signaling pathway during seed germination15, is also stabilized by SIZ1. These results indicate that sumoylation is a regulatory mechanism in ABA responses.. The modified stability of transcription factors is often concomitant with altered transcriptional activities. Several cis-regulatory elements are involved in ABA signaling, such as the ABA responsive element (ABRE)16, the coupling element (CE)1718, MYC recognition sites (MYCRs) and MYB recognition sites (MYBRs)1920 and NAC recognition sites (NACRs)21. Among them, the ABRE is the best characterized cis-acting regulatory element and is recognized by the ABRE-binding protein/ABRE binding factor (AREB/ABF) in ABA-dependent gene expression22232425. However, a single ABRE copy is not sufficient for ABA-induced gene transcription and coupling elements, such as CE1 and CE3, are required for an effective ABA-responsive complex1718. Using gel shift assays and yeast one-hybrid screenings, a group of proteins which could interact with CE1 or a CE1-like element were identified and designated as CE1 binding proteins (CEBPs)26. These proteins belong to the APETALA2/Ethylene Response Factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factor family26. In addition, most CEBPs can interact with the GCC-box, which acts as a cis-acting regulatory element in ethylene and jasmonic acid responses2728.. Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) functions as a versatile scaffold protein in all well-studied eukaryotic organisms29. The structure of RACK1 is characterized as a seven-bladed -propeller, which provides a platform for protein-protein interaction in both mammalian and plant cells3031. RACK1 is a ribosomal protein but it possesses no known enzymatic activity32. In the Arabidopsis genome, there are three homologous RACK1 genes, RACK1A, RACK1B and RACK1C33. Accumulating evidence indicates that RACK1 plays pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes in plants. RACK1 regulates plant developmental processes, including rosette leaf production and root development34. RACK1 also mediates responsiveness to multiple phytohormones, such as brassinosteroid, gibberellins and abscisic acid, and functions in disease resistance and the innate immune pathway33. In addition, RACK1 is involved in several abiotic stresses, for example, water stress31.. It is well-known that Arabidopsis RACK1 participates in ABA signaling. Based on the observation that a rack1a single mutant, and rack1a/rack1b or rack1a/rack1c double mutants are hypersensitive to the inhibition effect of ABA in seed germination, cotyledon greening and root growth, it was proposed that AtRACK1 functioned as a negative regulator of the ABA response35. RACK1 affected the accumulation and processing of pri-miR159, which targets TF MYB33 and MYB65 in ABA responses36. On the other hand, ABA down-regulated the expression of RACK1 and eIF6, which is a regulator for 80S ribosome assembly in mammalian cells37. This supports the finding that ABA impaires biogenesis of 60S ribosome subunit and ribosome assembly, although ABA had no effect on the RACK1-eIF6 interaction37. These studies indicate that Arabidopsis RACK1 might be involved in an ABA-regulated feedback loop. Although RACK1s play important roles in the ABA response, little is known about their up- and downstream interacting partners or the roles they play in regulating the ABA response.. Here, we report that Arabidopsis RACK1B is sumoylated at four residues, K50, K276, K281 and K291. Sumoylation increases the stability of RACK1B by blocking Ub-conjugation. Increased levels of exogenous ABA interfere with the balance between sumoylation and ubiquitination of RACK1B and pushes the balance towards sumoylation, thereby enhancing RACK1B stability. In addition, we provided evidence that ABA-stimulated sumoylation increased the interaction between RACK1B and transcription factor RAP2.6, which is a member of AP2/ERF family. This interaction resulted in altered affinity of RAP2.6 for CE1 and the GCC-box, which are important responsive elements in ABA and ethylene/jasmonic acid signaling, respectively172838.. . Results. . RACK1B is subjected to sumoylation. By analyzing protein structures and sequence homology of RACK1 from Arabidopsis and other species, two lysine residues, K272 and K276, were predicted to be potential sumoylation sites in AtRACK1B31. Further analysis with SUMOsp 2.0 software39 showed that both K276 and K272 have high probability as sumoylation sites and represent consensus and non-consensus sequences for sumoylation, respectively. To test whether RACK1B could be sumoylated, stable transgenic line expressing Flag-RACK1B in rack1b-2 background was used. The Flag tagged RACK1B was enriched by immunoprecipitation. Sumoylated RACK1B was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1A). The identity of the protein corresponding to the immunoreactive signal at 50 kD was further confirmed to be SUMO1-conjugated RACK1B by tandem liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Supplementary Table S1). These results suggested that RACK1B is indeed sumoylated by SUMO1 in vivo.. Protein sumoylation can be accomplished either in an E3-dependent or an E3-independent manner40. To understand the RACK1B sumoylation mode and to verify the sumoylation site(s), an in vitro system consisting of E1, E2, SUMO and target protein was reconstituted in E. coli. The SUMO pathway-related proteins, SAE1B, SAE2, SCE1A and SUMO1(GG) were co-expressed with HA-RACK1B in E. coli. Note that SUMO1(GG) was used to mimic the mature form of SUMO1, which has C-terminal diglycine residues. A mutated version of SUMO1 containing two Ala residues [SUMO1(AA)], which cannot form a thioester bond, was used as a negative control641. In agreement with the in vivo experiment, both RACK1B and SUMO1-conjugated RACK1B could be detected (Fig. 1B). To our surprise, sumoylated RACK1B could still be detected in K272R and K276R single mutants and in the K272/K276R double mutant, suggesting that other undiscovered sumoylation sites may exist (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, RACK1B was not subjected to SUMO3 or SUMO5 conjugation in vitro, suggesting that RACK1B is specifically sumoylated by SUMO1 (Supplementary Fig. 1).. The fact that RACK1B can be sumoylated in vitro without the help of an E3 ligase indicates that SCE1A (E2) is able to directly recognize RACK1B. To test the hypothesis that SCE1A and RACK1B are components of one complex, we performed pull-down assays. The results showed that SCE1 directly interacted with RACK1B (Fig. 1C). SCE1A is self-sumoylated at Lys15 and at the catalytic Cys94 residue (within the active center)9; therefore, we investigated whether sumoylation of SCE1A is a prerequisite for sumoylation of RACK1B. Cys94 and Lys15 were mutated to Ser and Arg, respectively, via site-directed mutagenesis. As shown in Fig. 1D, RACK1B could be sumoylated by SCE1AK15R but not by the negative control SCE1AC94S, which suggested that SCE1A sumoylation at Lys15 was not necessary for RACK1B sumoylation. We also tested whether the two known E3 ligases contribute to the RACK1B sumoylation. The SIZ1 could interact with RACK1B and increased concentration of SIZ1 resulted in increased conjugation of SUMO1 on RACK1B in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 2A,B). However, sumoylated RACK1B remained detectable in the siz12 mutant (Supplementary Fig. 2C), suggesting that sumoylation of RACK1B is facilitated by but not rely on SIZ1. For the other E3 ligase, HPY2, due to severe dwarfism and defective meristems8, we failed to overexpress RACK1B in the hpy22 mutant. Therefore, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed to examine the interaction between RACK1B and HPY2. HPY2 was not precipitated with RACK1B and could not facilitate its sumoylation (Supplementary Fig. 2DE), suggesting that HPY2 might not be involved in the RACK1B sumoylation complex. Taken together, these results suggested that RACK1B can be sumoylated via direct interaction between SCE1A and RACK1B.. . . RACK1B contains four lysine receptors of SUMO1. The sumoylation site(s) of RACK1B were identified using LC-MS/MS. In the E. coli sumoylation system, SUMO1(GG) was replaced by SUMO1 H89R(GG), which leaves a QTGG footprint on receptor Lys residues after digestion with trypsin4243. The QTGG footprint facilitates the identification of sumoylated peptides via mapping the paralog-specific fragment ions. The sumoylated RACK1B was purified, separated and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3). Four Lys residues, Lys50, Lys276, Lys281 and Lys291, conjugated to the QTGG footprint, were identified (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S2). In addition to the consensus Lys276, Lys50 was located in a reverse consensus sequence (D/ExK), and the other two Lys residues were considered as non-consensus sites. To our surprise, Lys272 was not sumoylated.. The identified Lys receptors were then verified by immunoblot analysis. Five single mutants HA-RACK1B (K272R, K50R, K276R, K281R or K291R), four triple mutants [K276,281,291R (3KR-K50), K50,281,291R (3KR-K276), K50,276,291R (3KR-K281), K50,276,281R (3KR-K291)], and a quadruple mutant [K50,276,281,291R (4KR)] were constructed and expressed in the E. coli sumoylation system. The sumoylation level of RACK1BK276R was severely decreased compared to the other four single mutants, while the sumoylation level of RACK1B3KRK276 remained the highest among the four triple mutants (Fig. 2B,C), suggesting that SCE1A preferentially binds to the consensus Lys276 site in vitro. Mutation of the non-sumoylation site, K272R, increased the sumoylation level of RACK1B. The K50R mutation also slightly increased the level of sumoylation. Mutation of all four lysine residues severely decreased the sumoylation level both in vivo and in vitro although very low levels of sumoylation remained detectable (Fig. 2C,D). Taken together, these results indicated that RACK1B contains four sumoylation residues, Lys50, Lys276, Lys281 and Lys291.. . . Sumoylation increases the stability of RACK1B. One consequence of sumoylation is a change in protein turnover rate5; therefore, we explored whether sumoylation influenced the stability of RACK1B. The degradation rates between transiently expressed RACK1B co-expressed with and without SUMO1(GG) were compared after treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), which inhibits new protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3, the level of RACK1B was significantly decreased at 3h and was almost vanished at 5h after CHX treatment in protoplasts expressing wild-type RACK1B alone. Co-transformation of SUMO1(GG) with RACK1B retarded the degradation of RACK1B and it remained detectable even 9h after CHX treatment. Together, these results supported our postulation that sumoylation increases the stability of RACK1B. Note that we did not verify the degradation of RACK1B4KR as a negative control because mutation of these four lysine residues also reduced the level of ubiquitination (see below).. . . Sumoylation of RACK1B competes with its ubiquitination. Sumoylation of RACK1B increased its stability; therefore, we asked whether sumoylation prevents the degradation of RACK1B. First, we hypothesized that RACK1B is degraded by ubiquitination-mediated degradation. To confirm this, RACK1B and UBQ(GG) were co-expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. As shown in Fig. 4A, ubiquitinated RACK1B could only be detected after purification via Ni2+-chromatography with the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Selleck, Shanghai, China). The unmodified form of RACK1B (35kDa) was protected by MG132 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, over 95% of RACK1B was degraded after 6h without MG132. These results indicated that RACK1B is degraded through the ubiquitination-mediated 26S proteosomal degradation pathway.. To confirm whether sumoylation prevents the degradation of RACK1B by competing with ubiquitination, RACK1B or RACK1B4KRwas transformed into protoplasts with SUMO1(GG). Overexpression of SUMO1(GG) increased the sumoylation level of RACK1B but not that of RACK1B4KR (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the level of ubiquitinated RACK1B was significantly decreased in protoplasts overexpressing SUMO1(GG), whereas the level of ubiquitinated RACK1B4KR was slightly reduced and but still higher than that of RACK1B (Fig. 4D). This result suggested that other unidentified lysine receptors might also be potential ubiquitination sites, and the competition exists between sumoylation and ubiquitination of RACK1B.. . . ABA increases RACK1B stability by facilitating sumoylation. RACK1B is involved in the ABA signaling pathway35; therefore, we asked whether ABA regulates RACK1B at a post-translational level via sumoylation. Protoplasts expressing RACK1B were treated with different concentrations of ABA and, as expected, the sumoylation level of RACK1B significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). In addition, the sumoylation level of Myc-RACK1B4KR was not affected by ABA, although a background of sumoylation still existed (Fig. 5B). Next, the degradation rates of RACK1B in protoplasts treated with exogenous ABA and in mock protoplasts were compared. The protoplasts were first treated with CHX to stop new protein synthesis and samples were harvested 3 and 6h after incubation in the presence or absence of ABA. RACK1B was more resistant to degradation with the addition of ABA as shown by a higher abundance of RACK1B at 6h (Fig. 5C). It is well-known that endogenous levels of ABA decrease during the first 24h of seed imbibition44; therefore, we examined whether endogenous ABA regulates the sumoylation of RACK1B by using the transgenic line 35S::Flag-RACK1B/rack1b-2 (Supplementary Fig. 4). As expected, the levels of unmodified RACK1B and sumoylated RACK1B in germinating seeds gradually decreased with the time of imbibition (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed and optimized to achieve the same level of unmodified Flag-RACK1B in each well. Consistent with the unmodified RACK1B, the level of sumoylated RACK1B also decreased as endogenous ABA declined (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results indicated that ABA enhances the stability of RACK1B by facilitating sumoylation. ABA increased the stability of RACK1B by up-regulating sumoylation and, at the same time, inhibiting ubiquitination-mediated degradation.. . . RACK1B interacts with RAP2.6 and alters its affinity to cis-elements. The transcription factor OsRAP2.6 interacts with OsRACK1 in the nucleus and cytoplasm45. Arabidopsis RAP2.6, which shares 94% amino acid identity with OsRAP2.6 in the AP2/ERF domain participates in ABA responses45. Because both RACK1 and RAP2.6 are nuclear localized3645 and ABA enhanced the stability of RACK1B via sumoylation (Fig. 4), we assumed that AtRACK1B could interact with AtRAP2.6 and function as a scaffold protein in the ABA response. To test this hypothesis, a GST pull-down assay was performed and showed that RACK1B interacted with RAP2.6 in vitro (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, a co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that RACK1B and RAP2.6 could interact in planta (Fig. 6B). When RACK1B and RAP2.6 were co-expressed in mesophyll protoplasts, RACK1B could be precipitated with anti-HA antibodies that recognize the HA tag fused to RAP2.6. RAP2.6 co-precipitated both RACK1B and sumoylated RACK1B and the intensity of co-precipitation was enhanced by exogenous ABA treatment. In addition, a greater amount of sumoylated RACK1B could be precipitated compared to unmodified RACK1B, while only unmodified RACK1B could be detected in crude extracts.. To test which domain of RAP2.6 is responsible for the interaction with RACK1B, truncated versions of RAP2.6 were generated (Fig. 6C). Based on a previous report, two conserved motifs, YRG and RAYD elements, exist in the AP2 domain of twelve RAP2 proteins46. As shown in Fig. 6D, the interaction could be detected when the peptide contained an intact AP2 domain (both YRG and RAYD motifs) or the YRG element alone, but not the N-terminal region of RAP2.6. Collectively, these results suggest that RACK1B interacts with RAP2.6 by direct binding to its AP2 domain and that this interaction could be enhanced by sumoylation of RACK1B.. AtRAP2.6 can bind to the GCC-box and the CE1 element, which serve as cis-acting regulatory elements in various phytohormone signaling pathways47 The intact promoter recognized by RAP2.6 remains elusive; therefore, we performed Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to examine whether the RACK1B-RAP2.6 interaction affects the binding of RAP2.6 to the GCC-box and/or CE1 elements. RACK1B and RAP2.6 were fused to His-tags and purified by Ni2+-chromatography. The result showed that the binding affinity of RAP2.6 to the CE1 element gradually improved with increasing amounts of RACK1B (Fig. 6E). In contrast, RACK1B decreased the binding affinity of RAP2.6 to the GCC-box (Fig. 6F). Taken together, these results suggest that RACK1B functions as a scaffold protein for RAP2.6 in the ABA response and alters the affinity of RAP2.6 for downstream cis-elements.. . . . Discussion. RACK1 proteins have been identified in all eukaryotic organisms and act as scaffold proteins that mediate protein-protein interactions or compete with other proteins for binding domains29. RACK1B participates in various hormone responses. For example, rack1a-1 and rack1a-2 mutants are insensitive to GA and BL, and produce reduced lateral roots when treated with exogenous 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid33. Here, we provide evidence for an expanded regulatory mechanism of ABA signaling that controls the stability of RACK1B, resulting in enhanced interaction with the transcription factor, RAP2.6. As summarized in Fig. 7, our study shows that RACK1B is sumoylated at four Lys residues via direct interaction with SCE1. The up-regulated sumoylation in response to ABA leads to increased stability and abundance of RACK1B, which results from competition with ubiquitination at the same residues. The interaction between RACK1B and RAP2.6 is also enhanced by sumoylation, which alters the affinity of RAP2.6 for its target cis-regulatory elements.. Studies of Arabidopsis sumoylation revealed that a few substrates are sumoylated in a SIZ1-dependent manner1014484950. The E2-dependent RACK1B sumoylation described here is different from that in these reports (Fig. 2). This is probably due to the high affinity between RACK1B and SCE1A, which is consistent with the finding that most E3 ligase-independent sumoylation occurs at non-consensus lysine residues. Indeed, two of four identified sumoylation sites in RACK1B are non-consensus lysine residues (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 4). Results of the in vitro sumoylation assay suggested that SIZ1 facilitated the sumoylation of RACK1B. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that SIZ1 contributes to the site selectivity since we failed to identified the sumoylated sites in vivo by MS analysis.. A consequence of sumoylation can be to alter substrate stability5. Many substrates are both sumoylated and ubiquitinated, and often at the same lysine residues. However, the inter-relationship between these two systems is substrate specific, and can act either synergistically or antagonistically5152. We observed that sumoylation increased RACK1B stability by antagonizing ubiquitination. The possible explanation is either two modifications share several common sites or SUMO molecule spatially blocks the ubiquitination sites or both. Besides, a form of coordination may exist between the lysine residues to balance the levels of sumoylation and ubiquitination. However, the ubiquitin complex targeting RACK1B degradation is unknown and this hypothesis requires further investigation.. It is well-known that ABA triggers multiple post-transcriptional modifications of proteins, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination5354. Here, we showed that ABA is also able to regulate sumoylation of target proteins. Blocking ubiquitination sites via sumoylation might be one of the regulatory mechanisms by which ABA stabilizes RACK1B (Figs 4 and 5). However, we have no direct evidence that sumoylation and ubiquitination of RACK1B are mutually exclusive in the ABA response, although ABA can inhibit the ubiquitination of RACK1B (Supplementary Fig. 6). It is possible that down-regulated ubiquitination resulted from various regulatory events, such as inhibition of the ubiquitination complex, or unidentified forms of post-transcriptional modification, instead of from direct competition for the modification of lysine residues. The varied modification status of RACK1B suggests that RACK1B is subjected to the interplay between various post-transcriptional modifications in response to different signals. A similar example is that of RACK1A phosphorylation by WNK8, which tends to be degraded in glucose signaling55. However, neither the phosphorylation-mimic nor the dead form of RACK1B at Ser122 and Thr161 abolished RACK1B sumoylation, although both forms affect its degradation (Supplementary Fig. 7). Therefore, the crosstalk between distinct post-transcriptional modifications of RACK1B in ABA signaling needs to be further investigated.. The interaction between RACK1B and RAP2.6 sheds light on RACK1B function that binds to one of AP2/ERF family TFs in ABA response. RAP2.6 preferentially binds to sumoylated RACK1B rather than unmodified RACK1B in vivo, suggesting that sumoylation facilitates RACK1B interaction with its binding partners (Fig. 6B). Additionally, ABA stimulates RACK1B sumoylation and, therefore, plays a role in regulating the dynamics of the interaction between RACK1B and RAP2.6, which could influence the expression of downstream target genes in response to ABA. Three RACK1 proteins were regarded as negative regulators of the ABA response3537. The expression of the ABA marker gene, RAB18, was induced by ABA in a rack1a mutant and a rack1a/rack1b double mutant as early as 3h after treatment35. However, in RAP2.6 overexpressing plants, RAB18 was induced after 24h ABA treatment47. These downstream events continue to obscure the function of RACK1 in the ABA response. One possible explanation is that RACK1B acts as a scaffold to a wide range of proteins for distinct TFs in ABA signaling and, therefore, induction of RAB18 in rack1 mutants is a cumulative effect of impaired activities of distinct TFs due to loss of the platform.. RACK1 is a highly conserved WD40 repeat family protein present in a wide range of eukaryotic species, from microorganisms to plants and animals29. RACK1 is a scaffold protein that acts as a hub for the interaction of signaling proteins, including kinases/phosphatases5556, G proteins57, transcription factors58, cytoskeleton proteins29, and the ubiquitin complex59. Four main effects of RACK1 on interacting proteins have been described: diversifying intermolecular interaction, changing the activity of partners, regulating the stability of partners and shuttling partners from one location to another60. However, in contrast to the detailed understanding of RACK1 in animals, very few studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms of RACK1 in plants. In rice, OsRACK1 is a component of the Rac1 complex and plays a role in the production of reactive oxygen species, and is involved in resistance to rice blast infection61. Its homolog in Arabidopsis, AtRACK1, is involved in a novel immune pathway that consists of the G-protein-RACK1-MAPK cascade and which transmits the signal of pathogen-secreted proteases57. AtRACK1 also affects the accumulation and precision of pri-miRNAs by interacting with SERRATE and associating with the AGO1 complex36. Here, we postulate that a potential effect of RACK1B on RAP2.6 is to regulate its transcriptional activity because the in vitro EMSA result indicated that RAP2.6 has altered affinity to the GCC-box and CE1 elements once bound to RACK1B. This result also indicates that RACK1B and RAP2.6 are potential crosslink nodes between different abiotic and biotic signaling pathways. Identification of the target gene(s) of RAP2.6 will help explain the regulatory effect of RACK1B in signal transduction.. Sequence analysis revealed that RAP2 proteins are highly divergent except for the presence of at least one AP2 domain46. AP2/ERF proteins constitute a large family of plant specific transcription factors with more than 120 members in Arabidopsis62. Based on copies of the AP2 domain and sequence similarity, they can be categorized into three subfamilies, the AP2, ERF, and RAV subfamilies6263. On the other hand, a number of cis-regulatory elements are mainly recognized by AP2/ERF transcription factors, including the drought responsive element/C-repeat responsive element (DRE/CRT)64, the ethylene responsive element (ERE or GCC-box)38, the JA and elicitor responsive element (JERE)65, the bipartite sequence66, and the ANT consensus site67. Because RACK1B binds directly to the AP2 domain within RAP2.6, we hypothesize that RACK1B is capable of binding different AP2/ERF members that contain an AP2 domain that shares high similarity with that of AtRAP2.6. High-throughput screening methods, such as yeast-two hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation, have identified potential binding partners29. Detailed analysis of these proteins will yield a better understanding of RACK1 function in plants.. . . Methods. . Plant materials and growth conditions. Arabidopsis with a Col-0 ecotype was used in the study. The T-DNA mutants, siz1-2 (SALK_065397)7, hpy2-2 (SAIL_77_G06)8 and rack1b-2 (SALK_145920)34 used in this study were described previously.. Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol and subsequently soaked in 10% NaClO for 10min and then washed with sterilized H2O five times. Seeds were germinated on MS medium with 0.7% agar. For seed propagation, one-week-old seedlings were transferred to soil and grown in a phytotron at 22C with light intensity of 120molm2s1 and a 16/8h photoperiod.. . . Generation of transgenic Arabidopsis plants. RACK1B coding sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned into pHB vector68 with Flag tag was fused to the N-terminus. The plasmids were transformed into Agrobaterium tumefaciens (EHA105) and plant transformation was performed by the floral dip method. Sequences of all the primers used in the study are listed in Supplementary Table S3.. . . Antibodies. Mouse anti-HA was purchased from Youke Biotechnology (Shanghai, China), mouse anti-Myc and anti-GST, and rabbit anti-S tag antibodies were from GenScript (Nanjing, China). Rabbit anti-SUMO1 and anti-UBQ antibodies were from Agrisera (Vnns, Sweden). Rabbit anti-TUBB2A antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, USA). The secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (sc-2005) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2004) were from Santa Cruz (Dallas, TX, USA).. . . Isolation of total RNA and first-strand synthesis of cDNA. Arabidopsis total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. One microgram of total RNA was used as template for first-strand cDNA synthesis using the PimeScript One Step RT-PCR Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). The cDNA was used as template for further PCR amplification of the coding sequences of indicated genes.. . . Molecular cloning of RACK1B and site directed mutagenesis. RACK1B was amplified from cDNA by PCR and cloned into pMD18 with HA tag fused at N-terminus. RACK1B sequences with the following mutations, K50R, K272R, K276R, K281R, K291R, 3KR-K50, 3KR-K276, 3KR-K281, 3KR-K291 and 4KR, were synthesized (GenScript) and cloned into pUC57 with HA tag fused at N-terminus. These plasmids were used as starting plasmids for other constructions.. The His89 of SUMO1 was mutated to Arg to generate SUMO1H89R(GG). At the same time, Gly92 and Gly93 were mutated to Ala to generate SUMO1H89R(AA). SCE1AK15R and SCE1AC94S were generated by site directed mutagenesis. PCR was used to perform the site directed mutagenesis using specific primers and cDNA as temperate.. . . Transient expression of proteins in protoplasts. Proteins were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Four-week-old seedlings were used for mesophyll protoplast isolation and plasmid transfection according to a previously described method69. After incubation for 20h in normal growth conditions, unless indicated otherwise, protoplasts were harvested for protein extraction.. . . Protein purification by Ni2+-chromatography. Total proteins were extracted from protoplasts using lysis buffer A containing 25mM Tris-HCl, 200mM NaCl pH 7.8, 2mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100 and 1mM PMSF. Protein concentration was measured with the Bradford method and 2mg of total proteins were used for further purification.. For purification of recombinant proteins, 50mL E. coli culture were collected for protein extraction. Proteins with the hexa-histidine tag were purified using Ni2+-NTA sepharose (Qiagen, Venlo, Limburg, Netherlands) according to the manufacturers instructions. The purified protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting.. . . Immunoprecipitation of proteins and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Total proteins (1mg) extracted from protoplasts were incubated with desired antibodies at 4C for 12h with gentle shaking and then protein G agarose (Roche) slurry was added and incubation continued at 4C for another 4h. The resin was collected and washed with 10-bed volumes of lysis buffer A three times. Proteins were then eluted with 2sampling buffer. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, the enriched proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with another antibody. The chemiluminescence was visualized using a Tanon-5200 Chemiluminescent Imaging System (Tanon Science and Technology, Shanghai, China).. . . RACK1B sumoylation assay in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. His-SUMO1(GG), Myc-RACK1B, Myc-RACK1BK276R, Myc-RACK1B3KR-K276 and Myc-RACK1B4KR were amplified by PCR, and subsequently cloned into the expression vector, pGreenII 62-SK to generate 35S::His-SUMO1(GG), 35S::MYC-RACK1B, 35S::MYC-RACK1BK276R, 35S::MYC-RACK1B3KR-K276 and 35S::MYC-RACK1B4KR, respectively. His-SUMO1(GG) and different types of Myc-RACK1B proteins were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. The proteins sumoylated by His-SUMO1 were purified by Ni2+-chromatography. Sumoylation of RACK1B was detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-Myc antibodies.. . . RACK1B ubiquitination assays in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. His-UBQ(GG) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGreenII 62-SK to generate 35S::His-UBQ(GG). His-UBQ(GG) was co-expressed with Myc-RACK1B in Col-0 protoplasts, which were then treated with 50M MG132 to block protein degradation or DMSO as control for 20h. The ubiquitinated proteins were purified using Ni2+-chromatography and ubiquitination of RACK1B was detected by immuno blotting using anti-Myc antibodies.. . . Sumoylation of RACK1B in imbibed seeds. The WT Col-0 and Flag-RACK1B transgenic seeds (35S::Flag-RACK1B/rack1b-2) in the background of the T-DNA insertion mutant rack1b-2 were freshly harvested. For each individual sample, 50mg seeds were used and imbibed in water for 0, 3, 6, 16 and 24h. Proteins were extracted with lysis buffer A and filtrated through a 0.2M filter membrane (Millipore) to exclude the insoluble substances. Flag-RACK1B was immunoprecipitated with anti-DYKDDDDK beads (Clontech) and the sumoylation level of RACK1B was detected using anti-SUMO1 antibodies.. . . In vitro sumoylation assays. For sumoylation assay in E. coli system, pACYCDuet-1 and pCDFDuet-1 were used to reconstitute the Arabidopsis SUMO pathway in E. coli as described41. pACYCDuet-1 carries two subunits of E1 (SAE1B and SAE2). SAE1B and SAE2 were fused with an S-tag and His tag, respectively. pCDFDuet-1 carries a SUMO molecule [SUMO1H89R(GG), SUMO1H89R(AA), SUMO3(GG) or SUMO5(GG)] and E2 (SCE1A, SCE1AK15Ror SCE1AC94S). SUMO and SCE1A were fused with a His tag and S-tag, respectively. HA-RACK1B was cloned into pET28a such that the His tag was fused at the N-terminus. All three plasmids were co-transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells. The transformants were inoculated and cultured at 37C to an OD600 of approximately 0.6. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.2mM. After induction for 12h at 25C, the cells were harvested and re-suspended in PBS buffer. Cells were lysed by sonication, centrifuged; and the supernatant was collected. The proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis after separation by SDS-PAGE.. For in vitro sumoylation assay, the coding sequences of SUMO1, SAE1B, SAE2, SCE1, SIZ1 and HPY2 were cloned into pET28a. The expression, purification and in vitro sumoylation assay were performed as described770.. . . Identification of sumoylation sites using mass spectrometry. The crude extracts from in vitro sumoylation assays were purified by Ni2+-chromatography and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained and the bands corresponding to sumoylated RACK1B were cut out (Supplemental Fig. 2). The gel slices were cleaned, desalted and concentrated via vacuum centrifugation and then digested with 5ng/L trypsin at 37C for at least 20h. Tryptic peptides were acidified with 100L extraction buffer (60% ACN, 0.1% TFA).. LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using QE mass spectrometry with a nano-electrospray ion source (ThermoFisher) coupled to a ThermoFisher Easy nLC1000 high performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a 0.15mm150mm Zorbax 300SB-C18 column. Peptides were separated using a linear gradient of 450% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) for 50min, 50100% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) from 50min to 54min, and 100% acetonitrile for 60min. MS spectra were acquired in full-scan mode at a resolution of 100,000 and 10 MS/MS spectra were acquired per MS. MS/MS precursor selection met the criteria that the charge state be known and 2. Peptide sequences were searched using MASCOT 2.2 software against the Arabidopsis protein database and common contaminants. Search parameters included a precursor mass tolerance of 2.5 Da, fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.2 Da, up to two missed cleavages, oxidation of Met, variable modification of Lys residues by sumoylation (QTGG, +343.1492m/z or pyroQTGG, +326.1226m/z), and a filter by score 45.. . . In vitro GST pull-down assay. To verify the interaction of RACK1B with SCE1A and SIZ1, coding sequences of RACK1B, SCE1A and SIZ1 were cloned into pGS-21a (GenScript) to generate GST-RACK1B, GST-SCE1 and GST-SIZ1, respectively.. To verify the interaction between RACK1B and RAP2.6, HA tagged RAP2.6 was cloned into pET28a and pGreenII 62-SK to generate His-HA-RAP2.6 and 35S::HA-RAP2.6, respectively. To examine the domain of RAP2.6 that interacted with RACK1B, HA-tagged truncated peptides of RAP2.6 were generated by PCR and cloned into pET28a to generate expression vectors.. GST-RACK1B, GST-SIZ1, His-HA-RACK1B or SCE1A-S was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). His-HA-RAP2.6 and truncated peptides were expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3). Transformed strains were first grown at 37C until OD600 reached 0.6~0.8. Cultures were then induced with 0.1mM IPTG for 2h at 25C. Cells were harvested in binding buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 200mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) at a ratio of 1:10. For the SIZ1-RACK1B interaction, 500L crude extract of GST-SIZ1 for each individual trial was incubated with 30L glutathione-Sepharose beads (GenScript) for 1h on ice. After washing three times with 20 volumes of binding buffer, the beads were incubated with 200L crude extract of His-HA-RACK1B for another 1h on ice. After another wash step, the bound proteins were eluted with 2SDS-PAGE sampling buffer. The same binding conditions were used for RACK1B-SCE1A and RACK1B-RAP2.6 (or truncated RAP2.6) interactions, except that 100L crude extract of GST-RACK1B was used as bait protein and equal volumes of crude extracts of SCE1A-S and His-HA-RAP2.6 (or truncated mutants) were used as prey proteins. The interactions were detected by immunoblot analysis using the antibodies indicated.. . . EMSA. Oligonucleotides 4CE1 and 4GCC element was synthesized and biotin labeled (Genewiz, Suzhou, China) with the sequences: 5-GGAATTC TGCCACCGG TGCCACCGG TGCCACCGG TGCCACCGG TCTAGAGC-3 and 5-GGAATTC AGCCGCC AGCCGCC AGCCGCC AGCCGCC TCTAGAGC-3, respectively47. The protein His-HA-RAP2.6 was expressed and induced as described above, and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (Qiagen). In the binding assays, 1g His-RAP2.6 and 50fmol biotin-labeled CE1 element, or 0.5g His-HA-RAP2.6 and 100fmol biotin-labeled GCC-box was used. Purified His-RACK1B was added as indicated. The binding reaction (in a volume of 20l) was performed in binding buffer containing 10mM Tris, 50mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 1g poly (dIdC), pH 7.5. Binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20min and analyzed by PAGE on 6% gels in 0.5TBE buffer. Gels were blotted on Hybond-N+ membranes (GE healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and signals were detected using a Light Shift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturers instructions.. . .

PMC5344924	Introduction. Paulownia, a fast-growing greening tree species, has many sought-after characteristics, including lightweight wood, high biomass production, and vigorous resprouting ability, which make them ideal environment protection trees. However, Paulownia is susceptible to a phytoplasma that causes Paulownia witches' broom (PaWB) disease, which gradually reduces biomass production (Doi et al., 1967). PaWB disease is usually characterized by stunted growth, witches' brooms, and phyllody, followed by dieback of branches and phloem necrosis (Namba, 2002).. Numerous studies have been carried out on Paulownia phytoplasma and the interaction of host with pathogen, and some advances at the physiological and chemical morphological, genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic levels have been made (Doi et al., 1967; Fan and Jiang, 1997; Fan et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2009; Mou et al., 2013). The infecting phytoplasma lacks a cell wall and is bound only by a triple-layered unit membrane, which makes it difficult to culture in vitro (Doi et al., 1967). Although high-throughput sequencing and epigenetic technologies have been used to investigate the genes, microRNAs, and inherent metabolic pathways related to PaWB disease (Liu et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2014a,b; Fan et al., 2014, 2015a,b,c; Niu et al., 2016) however, understanding of the whole mechanisms of Paulowniaphytoplasma interactions is still lacking.. Proteins play important roles in catalyzing almost all chemical reactions, including those involved in plant growth and development, metabolism, and resisting pathogen invasion (Luge et al., 2014). Protein changes that occur in response to the interaction between Paulownia and phytoplasma have been studied using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE; Fan et al., 2003); however, it is difficult to separate low abundance proteins and hydrophobic proteins using this technique (Molloy and Witzmann, 2002; Baggerman et al., 2005). Thus, 2D-PAGE cannot be used to characterize the profiles of all the proteins in cells or tissues; furthermore, the results are often difficult to reproduce. To help overcome some of the disadvantages of 2D-PAGE, several proteomic quantitative methods have been developed (Lodha et al., 2013). One such method is iTRAQ, which involves isobaric tagging of peptides for protein quantitation using mass spectrometry. iTRAQ can be used to identify and quantify hundreds of proteins in up to eight samples at one time with high sensitivity and accuracy (Fan et al., 2011; Wang B. et al., 2015), and has been successfully applied to detect changes in protein abundances in plants with pathogen infections (Taheri et al., 2011; Monavarfeshani et al., 2013; Dadakova et al., 2015).. Previously, we have shown that the symptoms of PaWB disease were reversed by treatment with a suitable concentration of methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and that the phytoplasma was not detected in the recovered plants (Cao et al., 2014a; Fan et al., 2015a). In this study, we used iTRAQ to investigate protein changes in four groups of Paulownia tomentosa seedlings: healthy seedlings, phytoplasma-infected seedlings, and phytoplasma-infected seedlings treated with 20 or 60 mgL1 MMS. Proteins associated with PaWB disease were identified by searching against transcriptome sequences from the same samples. We identified a number of proteins that showed changes in abundance after infection by the PaWB phytoplasma, which may help in understanding the mechanisms associated with PaWB disease.. . . Materials and methods. . Plant material and treatment. All samples in this study were tissue culture seedlings, healthy P. tomentosa seedlings (HP) and P. tomentosa seedlings infected with PaWB phytoplasma (PIP), both of them were obtained from the Institute of Paulownia. These seedlings were cultured for 30 days on 1/2 MS medium before being clipped (Murashige and Skoog, 1962). After clipping, the terminal buds of 1.5-cm PIP were transferred into 100-mL triangular flasks containing 20 ml 1/2 MS culture medium supplemented with 0, 20, or 60 mgL1 MMS (PIP, PIP-20, and PIP-60 respectively). The terminal buds of 1.5-cm HP were transferred into the same medium without MMS as the control. All the seedlings were cultured in a darkroom at 20C for 5 days. After that, they were cultured at 25  2C under 130 molm2 s1 light intensity with a 16/8 h light /dark photoperiod for 25 days. Then, the terminal buds of 1.5-cm seedlings in the four treatment groups were sheared, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80C. For each treatment, 60 terminal buds were planted in 20 flasks. Each treatment was performed in triplicate.. . . Extraction of protein from paulownia. The four samples (HP, PIP, PIP-20, and PIP-60) were ground to powder in liquid nitrogen, then these different powder were added the moderate lysis buffer with 1 mM PMSF and 2 mM EDTA, the details of the protein extraction method was described as Tang et al. (2016).. . . iTRAQ labeling and strong cation exchange fractionation. To label the peptides obtained from the HP, PIP, PIP-20, and PIP-60 samples with iTRAQ reagent, 100 g total protein from each sample solution was digested with Trypsin Gold (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The peptides in the four samples were labeled with isobaric tags, the details method of iTRAQ-labeled according to the method of Meng et al. (2014). The labeled peptide mixtures were pooled and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography was performed with a LC-20AB HPLC Pump system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The labeled peptide mixture contained proteins extracted from the PIP, PIP-20, PIP-60, and HP samples, including two technical replicates of isotopic labeling. Each biological replicate consisted of 12 terminal buds of the same stage from four different samples.. . . LC-MS/MS analysis. The labeled peptide mixture was firstly resuspended and then the supernatant was loaded on a LC-20AD nano HPLC system (Shimadzu), then the data acquisition was performed with a TripleTOF 5600 System (AB sciex, concord, ON, Canada) fitted with a Nanospray III source (AB sciex) and a pulled quartz tip as the emitter (New Objectives, Woburn, MA). The mass spectrometer was operated with a RP of 30,000 full-width half-maximum for time-of-flight mass spectrometry scans. The method of the peptides were separated according to Qiao et al. (2012).. . . Data analysis. Raw data files were firstly converted into Mascot generic format files using Proteome Discoverer 1.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), then these data were matched against the transcriptome database containing 105,812 all-unigene sequences (Fan et al., 2015a,b). For protein identification, to reduce the probability of false peptide identification, only peptides at the 95% confidence interval, as defined by Mascot probability analysis, greater than identity were considered as identified, and each confident protein involved at least one unique peptide. For protein quantitation, it was required that a protein contained at least two unique spectra.. To further identify the functions of the identified proteins, the Blast2GO program was run against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database to assign them Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) databases were used to classify and group the identified proteins. Quantitative protein ratios were weighted and normalized by the median ratio in Mascot. Proteins with a fold change  1.2 and p < 0.05 were determined as differentially abundant proteins.. . . Correlation analysis of the transcriptome and proteome data. In this section, the correlation analysis of the transcriptome and proteome data was carried out. Firstly, the proteins identified by iTRAQ were matched to 105,812 unigene sequences of the transcriptome. After that, the proteins which have homologs in the transcritome were screened out. Then we calculated the number of the correlated protein in four different comparisons, including the PIP vs. PIP-20 comparison, PIP-20 vs. PIP-60 comparison, HP vs. PIP-60 comparison and HP vs. PIP comparison, and the correlated proteins can be considered as the identified proteins which have been expressed at the transcription level. Subsequently, the quantitative analysis of the correlated proteins was performed, and the criterion of the quantitation protein is the unique peptide 2. According to the results of the quantitative analysis, we further picked out the differentially expressed proteins (fold change  1.2 and p < 0.05) in different comparisons. At last, the number of the genes that corresponding to the correlated proteins and the number of differential expressed proteins were figured out. The other important correlation analysis is to compare the abundance levels of the differentially expressed proteins and their corresponding genes from the transcriptome sequencing.. . . Comparison scheme of proteins associated with PaWB. A comparison scheme of PaWB-related proteins was described by Liu et al. (2013). The proteins were searched against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database using the Blast2GO program to assign GO terms, and against the COG and KEGG databases to classify them to pathways and functional groups. To deeply analyze the function of PaWB-related proteins, protein BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was used to confirm the function of these proteins, then the functional classification of them was performed.. . . Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. RNA samples from HP, PIP, PIP-20, and PIP-60 were extracted with Trizol (Sangon, Shanghai, China). First-strand cDNAs of the RNA samples were synthesized using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). From the transcriptome data (Fan et al., 2015a,b), we randomly chosen 12 unigene sequences that corresponded to the differentially abundant proteins for qRT-PCR, primers for each of the unigenes were designed using PrimerPremier 5.0 software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, Calif). The results were analyzed using the 2Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2000). The expression level of each unigene was analyzed in three replicates. All the primers sequences used for the qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Statistical analysis was performed using SPASS 19.0 (SPASS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).. . . . Results. . Identification of basic protein information by iTRAQ analysis. We used an iTRAQ approach to analyze the total proteins in four P. tomentosa samples (HP, PIP, PIP-20, and PIP-60; Table 1). Protein homologs were identified against the transcriptome sequencing data from the same samples. We obtained 386,933 total spectra by combination analysis, and 21,948 of the spectra were matched using Mascot software. Among the 21,948 matched spectra, 17,811 were unique. The total number of detected proteins was 2,051 (Supplementary Table S2). The accuracy of the mass spectrometry was <2 ppm, and the database search peptides matching error was below 0.05 Da. We carried out two biological replicates to identify the total proteins and found that 1,597 of the proteins were identified in repeat 1, 1,657 were identified in repeat 2, and 1,203 were common to the two sets (Figure 1). The producibility of the proteomic analysis showed that the results for the duplicates were of high quality (Figure 2), which indicated that the proteome results were reliable.. . Table 1. .

The functions of the 2,051 identified proteins were classified using COG. The proteins were classified into 23 COG subgroups (Figure 3), among which general function prediction only, post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones, and energy production and conversion were significantly enriched and contained the largest numbers of proteins, while RNA processing and modification, defense mechanisms, and cell motility contained the smallest numbers of proteins (Supplementary Table S3). The 2,051 proteins were also classified into the three GO categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component (Figure 4). Under biological process, metabolic process contained the largest number of proteins; under cellular component, cell and cell part contained the largest numbers of proteins; and under molecular function, catalytic activity contained the largest number of proteins (Supplementary Table S4). In the KEGG pathways analysis (Supplementary Table S5), the 2,051 proteins were mapped to 117 biological pathways of which metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and ribosome were the most enriched metabolism pathways, while linoleic acid metabolism, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, and circadian rhythm-plant were the least enriched pathways. Based on these results, we concluded that most of the annotated proteins may affect metabolic processes, post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones, and catalytic activity.. .

Analysis of differentially abundant proteins between the diseased and recovered seedlings. Differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were defined as proteins having a 95% confidence level, p < 0.05, and fold changed >1.2. According to these criteria, the abundance of 1,172 of the 2,051 proteins did not differ significantly in the PIP vs. HP, PIP-60 vs. PIP-20, PIP-20 vs. PIP, and PIP-60 vs. HP comparisons, while the abundance of 879 of the proteins changed significantly (Table 2). Among the 879 DAPs, 223 were identified in PIP vs. HP, 204 were identified in PIP-60 vs. PIP-20, 278 were identified in PIP-20 vs. PIP, and 174 were identified in PIP-60 vs. HP. Further analysis indicated that most of the DAPs were correlated to several metabolism pathways, namely biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, photosynthesis, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, carotenoid biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, porphyrin, and chlorophyll metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, porphyrin, and chlorophyll metabolism, and plantpathogen interaction.. .

Correlation of transcriptome and proteome data. A correlation analysis of the transcriptome and proteome data was carried out, and the numerical relationships between the correlated proteins and the total proteins were calculated in the different comparisons. In the PIP vs. PIP-20 comparison, 2,050 proteins were correlated with the transcriptional data; among them, 1,046 proteins were quantitated and 278 of them were differentially abundant. In the PIP-20 vs. PIP-60 comparison, 2,048 proteins were correlated with the transcriptional data; among them 1,051 proteins were quantitated and 204 of them were differentially abundant. In the HP vs. PIP-60 comparison, 2,049 proteins were correlated with the transcriptional data; among them, 1,083 proteins were quantitated and 174 of them were differentially abundant. In the HP vs. PIP comparison, 1,073 proteins were quantitated and 223 of them were differentially abundant. All the numbers of these proteins corresponding genes were shown in Table 3.. . Table 3. .

Based on these results, we compared the abundance levels of the proteins and the expression levels of their corresponding genes. The following patterns were detected: (1) the same trend between the corresponding mRNA and protein levels; (2) the opposite trend between the corresponding mRNA and protein levels: (3) no change in protein levels, but changes in gene expression levels; (4) changes in protein levels, but no change in gene expression levels. These results show that the protein abundance level is not necessarily reflected in the expression level of the corresponding mRNA. Similar results have been reported in phytoplasma-infected Mexican lime (Monavarfeshani et al., 2013).. . . Analysis of DAPs related to PaWB. According to the comparison scheme of PaWB-related proteins, a total of 43 DAPs were obtained that changed their abundance levels in response to phytoplasma infection (Table 4), then the function of 43 DAPs were further classified in the COG, GO, and KEGG databases. The DAPs were classified into 13 COG categories (Supplementary Table S6), among which the three largest groups were energy production and conversion, post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones, and general function prediction only. The 43 DAPs were assigned 38 GO terms (Supplementary Table S7); 20 were under biological process, 11 were under cellular component, and five were under molecular function. In the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, the 43 DAPs were mapped to 27 pathways (Supplementary Table S8), among which the two largest groups were metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, while the two smallest groups were plant-pathogen interaction and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, indicating that changes in some metabolites may be important in the response of P. tomentosa seedlings to PaWB infection.. .

To confirm and dig out the function of the 43 DAPs, protein sequence BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was used to confirm the functional of the 43 DAPs in other plant. The result showed 40 DAPs functions have been confirmed in other plants (Table 4). Of these proteins, six proteins were classified in the section named as post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones, such as, 20S proteasome beta subunit, ubiquitin extension protein, subunit of chloroplasts chaperonin, peptidyl-Prolyl Isomerase, Co-chaperone GrpE family protein and fk506- and rapamycin-binding protein; six proteins participated in photosynthesis pathway, including chloroplast thylakoid lumen protein (TLP), photosystem I subunit E-2 (PSI-E2), plastid-specific ribosomal protein 4 (PSRP4), the component of the light harvesting complex (LHCI) and alpha carbonic anhydrase (CA), and the subunit E of photosystem I (PSI-E2); three proteins were associated with energy metabolism pathway, such as ATP synthase gamma subunit, NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), and the subunit of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC); two Ca2+-binding protein involved in cell signal transduction pathways; five proteins, included aldo/keto reductase, cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein, germin-like protein, and pectin methylesterase took part in plant defense. In addition these DAPs with functions, 3 of PaWB-related proteins were annotated as unknown function, their function still need to verify.. . . qRT-PCR analysis. To confirm the results of the transcriptome sequencing data, 12 gene sequences corresponding to PaWB-related proteins were selected randomly for the qRT-PCR assays (Figure 5). The results showed that the relative expressions of six of the 12 DAP-related unigenes were significantly down-regulated in the process of the morphometric recovery, while five were significantly up-regulated. These 11 DAP-related expression patterns were consistent with the results of the iTRAQ LC-MS/MS analysis. For one of DAPs, no related mRNA expression was detected. This discrepancy may be attributed to post-transcriptional processing, post-translational processing and modification, or to different rates of degradation of mRNA and protein.. . Figure 5. .

Discussion. Information about the molecular basis of the Paulownia response to phytoplasma infection is still meager. For many years, our group has investigated the molecular mechanisms of PaWB and reported changes at the physiology, biochemistry, morphology, and molecular levels in the host Paulownia plants (Fan et al., 2003, 2014, 2015a,b,c; Liu et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2014a,b; Steinhorst and Kudla, 2014; Niu et al., 2016). We identified some PaWB-related genes and functionally classified them, detected changes in DNA methylation levels and patterns, and discovered some important proteins related to PaWB disease. Even so, many relevant aspects of this disease still need to be addressed. In this study, we adopted a transcriptomic-assisted proteomic approach to investigate protein changes associated with the interaction of P. tomentosa and phytoplasma. We obtained a total of 2,051 proteins by searches against the transcriptome data (Fan et al., 2015a,b). According to our previous scheme, the correlation analysis between the transcriptome and proteome data identified 43 DAPs potentially related to PaWB. These DAPs were predicted to be involved in photosynthesis, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, the calvin cycle, glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis, epigenetic modification, plant resistance, and signal transduction.. . Phytoplasma infection decrease the expression of major components of photosynthesis. The onset of the yellowish leaves symptom in phytoplasma-infected plants is one of the most obvious symptoms of witches' broom. This symptom is closely related to changes in photosynthesis, and many studies have reported that photosynthesis is arrested in phytoplasma-infected plants, as evidenced by a decrease in pigment molecules such as chlorophyll b levels soon after infection (Scarpari et al., 2005). Accordingly, phytoplasma infection leads to a reduction in the expression of genes that encode photosystem components, further suppressing photosynthesis (Ji et al., 2009; Margaria et al., 2012; Nejat et al., 2015). Similar results have been reported in the interaction of Paulownia and phytoplasma, where several important protein components associated with photosynthesis were found to be significantly differentially abundant. These components include two proteins in photosystem I, six proteins in photosystem II, two proteins in light harvesting complex I, pyruvate kinase, and the pI6.8 24-kDa protein (Fan et al., 2003; Mou et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013).. In this study, we identified six DAPs participated in photosynthesis, including TLP, two PSI-E2s, PSRP4, LHCI, and CA, which had reduced abundance levels in response to phytoplasma infection.. In the phytoplasma-infected seedlings, we detected one DAP, PSRP 4 was down regulated, which belongs to photosystem II. Tiller et al. (2012) reported that Arabidopsis RNAi PSRP 4 mutant appeared light-green phenotype, smaller mesophyll cells, and the chlorophyll content, chloroplast translation, plastocyanin content, and maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (FV/FM) significantly reduced, and the mutants also showed strongly reduced accumulation of three complexes (photosystem II, cytochrome b6f complex, photosystem I), which were responsible for photosynthetic electron transport.. There were three DAPs belong to Photosystem I (PSI), including TLP, LHCI, and PSI-E2. It is well known that thylakoid lumens in both integral and soluble membrane proteins, and TLP take part in light harvesting and electron transfer in the photosynthetic chain. In this study, the TLP was down-regulated in the diseased seedlings. Evidences showed that the reduction of TLP not only damaged the thylakoid electron flow, but also decreased chlorophyll a content and further slacked the photosynthesis (Wang et al., 2016; Zhu, 2016), this result is consistent with the previous RNA-seq results, which showed that a reduction in photosynthesis of phytoplasma-infected plants could be attributed to the loss of several thylakoid membrane proteins (Mou et al., 2013). At the same time, the expression of LHCI was reduced, which severely affected the light reactions in Photosystem I (PSI) (Bressan et al., 2016). Interestingly, we also detected a decreased abundance of PSI-E2. Ihnatowicz et al. (2007) demonstrated that the rate of thylakoid electron transfer were not affected in the absence of PSI-E2. Therefore, we speculate that the decreased abundance of the thylakoid lumenal protein in the PaWB-infected P. tomentosa plants might partly explain the yellowish leaves symptom.. Another DAP associated with photosynthesis was CA, which had reduced abundance level in the phytoplasma-infected seedlings. This protein plays a vital role in the early event of photosynthesis. Zhurikova et al. (2016) indicated that the reduction of the activity of CA affected the effective quantum yield of photosystem II, thus, its low abundance might weaken photosynthesis in the phytoplasma-infected plants.. . . Phytoplasma infection induced the expression of proteins related to dwarf symptom. The hormonal imbalance in plants is the most factors for the abnormal symptom. Hoshi et al. (2009) discovered that TENGU can interfere the expression of auxin-related gene, which was the main reason for the plant proliferation and dwarf symptom. In the interaction of paulownia and phytoplasma, Mou et al. (2013) indicated that the key enzymes of cytokinin biosynthesis including isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase and isopentenyltransferase were significantly induced in the phytoplasma-infected Paulownia; Liu et al. (2013) demonstrated that the auxin efflux carrier 5NG4 were down-regulated in the phytoplasma-infected seedlings, which resulted in auxin accumulation in the paulownia.. In our proteome analysis, the abundance of two proteins that related to gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroid (BR) were changed after phytoplasma infection: for example, the abundance of the glycine rich protein GRP was increased in phytoplasma-infected seedlings. It has been shown that over-abundance of GRP reduced the activity of several intermediates of the GA biosynthetic pathway, and transgenic Arabidopsis (AtGRP) displayed reduced length of the vegetative stem (Lhr et al., 2014). The abundance of the membrane steroid binding protein (MSBP) also increased after phytoplasma infection. MSBP encodes a 220-amino acid protein that can bind to 24-epi-brassinolide and negatively regulates BR signaling, and overexpression of MSBP could inhibit cell elongation through downregulating cell elongation related genes, and result in the reduced cell elongation and shortened hypocotyl (Yang et al., 2005). Based on the results above, we concluded that the differentially abundant GRP and MSBP affected GA and BR biosynthesis, which were linked to the short internodes and dwarf morphology.. . . Phytoplasma infection disturb the energy metabolism balance of the host. Phytoplasma genomes lack many metabolic pathways, making them unlikely to synthesize nucleotides, and they lack the key gene for ATP synthesis, they may need to import ATP from their host (Carle et al., 2011). Therefore, in phytoplasma-infected plants, the host must supply enough energy for intense phytoplasma growth. In phytoplasma-infected mulberry, the host's energy production was decreased (Ji et al., 2009). Oshima et al. (2001) demonstrated that, in onion, phytoplasma strongly depended on the host's glycolysis pathway to obtain more energy, while, in phytoplasma-infected Mexican lime, energy production by the TCA cycle was significantly enhanced (Monavarfeshani et al., 2013).. In this study, we observed that the abundance levels of some key proteins related to energy metabolism in the phytoplasma-infected P. tomentosa, such as ATP synthase gamma subunit, NADP-ME, and GAPC. In the phytoplasma-infected P. tomentosa plants, the ATP synthase  subunit showed increased abundance. The ATP synthase  subunit is closely related to the ATP production, and the up-regulation of ATP synthase  subunit can enhance the photosynthetic rates in stressed plant (Budak et al., 2013). It is well known that the activity of chloroplast CF0-CF1-ATP synthase can be regulated by the light-dark. Kohzuma found that the modified  subunit by mutating conserved D211V, E212L, and 226L acidic amino acids only altered the light induced regulation, but not metabolism induced regulation, and verified the function mutants of  subunits affected photosynthetic ATP synthesis (Kohzuma et al., 2012, 2013). Therefore, in the photosynthesis pathway, the infected paulownia ATP might exhibit a tendency of increasing.. The other pathway of energy production is TCA cycle, an important pathway of energy production, in our study, the expression of DAP like NADP-ME showed decreased abundance, which plays a central role in the metabolite flux through the TCA cycle. In the Arabidopsis nadp-me knockout mutant, the contents of the TCA metabolites like 2-oxoglutarate and succinate were increased, while that of citrate and fumarate were decreased (Tronconi et al., 2008), implying that differential expression of NADP-ME had little impact on TCA cycle, and energy production by TCA cycle was not the necessary pathway for phytoplasma propagation in the host. This result was in disagreement with that in phytoplasma-infected Mexican lime (Monavarfeshani et al., 2013), the difference may be depend on the type of phytoplasmas and their hosts.. Another pathway of energy production is glycolytic pathway. GAPC, an important cytosolic enzyme which catalyzes a key reaction in glycolysis, was up-regulated in the phytoplasma infected seedlings. Evidence showed that GAPC play important roles in energy and carbohydrate metabolites, and Guo et al. (2014) reported that knockout or overexpression of GAPCs caused significantly changes in the content of intermediates of glycolytic pathway, the ratios of ATP/ADP, and NAD(P)H/NAD(P).. Compared with the DAPs functions of the three energy production pathways above, we supposed that glycolytic and photosynthesis may be the main energy provider for Paulownia response to the phytoplasma. However, details of the actual process need to be further researched.. . . Phytoplasma infection evokes complicated cell signal transduction pathways in the host. The involvement of cell signal transduction pathways in plantpathogen interactions directly or indirectly affected plant development (Ranjan et al., 2015). In Paulowniaphytoplasma interactions, many cell signal-related proteins have been identified from the transcriptome level, including plant hormones, calcium-dependent protein kinases, MAP kinases, receptor-like kinases, LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinases, L-ascorbate peroxidase, (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase, and nitricoxide synthase (Mou et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2014a,b; Fan et al., 2015b). In our proteome analysis, we detected several DAPs mainly involved in Ca2+, ROS and plant defense signal pathway.. Calcium, an ubiquitous secondary messenger, plays an important role in all aspects of cell function, which has been regarded as versatile intracellular signal (Steinhorst and Kudla, 2014). Calcium-binding proteins is the component of the calcium-signaling pathway. In this study, two Ca2+-binding proteins were increased after phytoplasma infection. Zhou et al. (2013) reported that pathogen can manipulate the host Ca2+ signaling machinery to benefit their own life cycles. At the same time, evidence also has been documented that the calcium-binding protein could be as an effector taking part in plant defense (Ye et al., 2017), demonstrating that calcium-signaling pathway plays a central role in the interaction of paulownia and phytoplasma.. The abundance of the germin-like protein GLP, which belongs to a large ubiquitous family of plant glycoproteins, was also increased in the PaWB-infected seedlings. GLP plays a vital role in plant defense (Rietz et al., 2012). Further, it has been reported that high levels of GLP may initiate oxidative bursts in pathogen-infected plants and elevate the levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Beracochea et al., 2015). Increasing evidence has shown that ROS (and redox signals) not only can induce cell damage, but also can act as reactive substrates to kill pathogens (Nejat et al., 2015). However, the ROS production was regulated by antioxidant protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which was induced after phytoplasma infection. PDI, a major ER protein, usually acts as a molecular chaperone and component of signal-transduction pathways. It has been reported that PDI can limit potential cell damage by ROS generation after pathogen infection in plants (Stolf et al., 2011), which has been implicated in the complex interplay of defense-related signaling pathways.. Keeping the above views in mind, our results indicate that the response of P. tomentosa to PaWB infection involved several interconnected signaling pathways, including Ca2+ and ROS-mediated signaling, and plant defense signaling, which coordinate the plant's response to phytoplasma. Regulation of cell signal pathways need different proteins that are induced by interactions with susceptible as well as resistant hosts, which play positive or negative roles in the Paulownia response to phytoplasma, depending on the speed and intensity of the interaction responses.. . . . Conclusions. In this study, we combined transcription and proteome analyses to investigate changes in protein abundances in P. tomentosa plants in response to phytoplasma infection. The results revealed complex interactions between the Paulownia plants and the phytoplasma, which will contribute substantially to our understanding of the still largely unknown mechanisms that underlie the pathogenicity of phytoplasma. By analyzing the data, we obtained 2,051 proteins, 879 of which were differentially abundant, and 43 of them were found to be related to PaWB. Most of these proteins were predicted to participate in photosynthesis, energy production, and cell signal pathways. Based on the functional analysis of DAPs, we concluded that PaWB infection might lead to decreased photosynthesis, induced the expression of proteins related to dwarf symptom, unbalanced host energy metabolism, as well as abnormalities in cell signal transduction. Together, our data contribute to better understanding the mechanisms associated with PaWB. Future challenges will be to validate the roles of individual proteins and explore their functions in the regulation of the Paulownia response to phytoplasma.. . . Ethics statement.

PMC5343467	Arabidopsis thaliana has spread over the northern hemisphere in post-glacial times and colonized habitats from cold continental areas to warm maritime ones12. With separation and adaptation, the radiating populations partly lost or modified their cold tolerance mechanisms in warmer areas, while they maintained and specified them in cold ones345.. Arabidopsis activates cold acclimation in response to persisting or oscillating cold stress67. It is quickly lost, when the temperatures increase89. As shown recently10, Arabidopsis can nevertheless memorize an earlier (priming) cold stress for several days over a stress-free period.. Plants sense cold e.g. by changes in the membrane fluidity, by membrane proteins, photosynthetic imbalances and changes in metabolic activity1112131415. Subsequently, Ca2+, cAMP, hormone and ROS signaling and the CBF (C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR)-regulon are activated151617181920. Finally, osmolytes and stress protection proteins accumulate and the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids increases2122. These responses protect the plants against chilling stress and often harden them also against subzero temperatures (freezing stress)623.. The speed and extent of cold acclimation and deacclimation vary between Arabidopsis accessions48242526. Accessions with fast and strong activation of cold acclimation also deacclimate more slowly8. Expression of genes encoding enzymes of the plastid antioxidant system (PAS) is either more decreased or poorly induced by cold in these accessions,. In response to weaker antioxidant protection, more reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate and the ratio of free radicals to H2O2 shifts stronger upon deacclimation24. Post-cold regulation of plastid ascorbate peroxidases mitigates chloroplast-to-nucleus ROS signaling and limits cold induction of target genes for ROS signaling for several days10. We hypothesized that cold priming of chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling is especially important in spring. In the first weeks of the new vegetation period, the temperature and the light intensity increase. The environmental parameters strongly fluctuate and differentially influence the signaling hubs, which regulate plant development27.. To evaluate the costs and benefits of a cold pretreatment in a natural environment, we compared cold (4C) pretreated and nave plants of seven Arabidopsis thaliana accessions with different cold acclimation potentials in the field in four experimental series. Two started in the first days of March and two in the begin of May in two subsequent years. For control, plant sets of the same size and composition were cultivated in a temperature and humidity controlled greenhouse. Three of the seven accessions, namely N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1, strongly activate CBF-regulon controlled cold acclimation828. The other four accessions, WS, Col-0, Van-0 and Cvi-0, have an intermediate to low cold acclimation potential828 and express and regulate PAS genes stronger in the cold2429. Plant robustness and reproductive fitness (seed production per plant) were determined by analysis of photosystem II activity, growth parameters, induction of flowering and seed yields.. . Results. Seven Arabidopsis thaliana accessions with gradually different cold acclimation potential were transferred to the field in the traditional Dahlem agricultural research area and to a close-by greenhouse after a 2 week long cold pretreatment at 4C. The plants were grown in randomized patterns with not cold-treated (nave) 4 week old plants, which were indistinguishable from cold-treated ones in leaf number, weight and pigmentation10.. . Weather conditions. Berlin is situated in the North-East of Germany in the Warsaw-Berlin valley between the Barnim and the Teltow plateaus. The climate is widely continental with cold winters, hot summers and short spring periods. Frequently, like in 2014 and 2015, March is already snow-free with day- and night-time temperatures above 4C (Fig. 1 and Suppl. 1). From day 6 of the experiment onwards, the mean temperatures increased in both years. As it is typical for the spring season in Berlin, they dropped again to values below 5C, mid of March, end of March, in the first half of April and beginning of May in 2015 and mid of April and in early May in 2014 (Suppl. 1).. The global radiation was 400580Wm2 on mid-day on the first days of the March experiments (Fig. 1 Middle), which corresponds to a maximum quantum flux of approximately 10 times the light intensity the plants were acclimated to in the growth chamber. In 2014, the maximum and mean radiations (1452Wm2 and 209Wm2) were higher than in 2015 (1385Wm2 and 193Wm2).. The air humidity was around 95% during the nights and between 50 and 65% during the days in the first week of March 2014 (Fig. 1 Bottom). The vegetation period was in general a bit dryer in 2015 than in 2014. The air humidity differed strongest between the two years in June and July, when the seeds matured (Suppl. 1).. . . Photosynthetic performance in the field. Temperature and light variation influence photosynthetic electron transport and carbon assimilation1830. The maximum and effective quantum yields of photosystem II (FV/FM and PS-II) are frequently analyzed indicators for photosystem-II (PS-II) damage and regulation3132. They can be determined non-destructively by chlorophyll-a fluorescence32. As reported recently under exactly the same pre-cultivation conditions, FV/FM is 0.83 in Arabidopsis plants directly after 2 weeks at 4C due to acclimation10. It stays high in the plants, after they are transferred to optimal growth conditions with temperatures around 20C10. In the figures, the data were arranged according to the LT50 values of the accessions for freezing tolerance after 2 weeks a 4C (as determined by electrolyte leakage from pretreated leaves at sub-zero temperatures828) (Table 1).. . March. On the first day after the transfer of cold-pretreated and nave plants to the field in early March, FV/FM and PS-II dropped in all nave plants (Fig. 2 left). FV/FM and PS-II were significantly higher in the cold-pretreated plants. The two accessions with the weakest cold acclimation potential, Van-0 and Cvi-0 had the lowest FV/FM and PS-II values. Over all accessions, PS-II correlated with FV/FM (rP=0.996) demonstrating that inactivation of photosystem II dominated over regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.. Within the first week in the field, FV/FM increased in the cold-pretreated plants to levels close to those observed in the greenhouse (Fig. 3 left). In previously nave plants, except Cvi-0, recovery of the PS-II quantum yield efficiency was delayed (Fig. 3 left). This reaction was slowest in the strongest cold acclimating accessions N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1. In these three accessions, FV/FM and PS-II decreased only on day 2 or day 3 in the field. Afterwards PS-II activity recovered, like in the other plants.. In 2014 (Fig. 2 left), FV/FM was less decreased in the not cold-pretreated plants than in 2015. The light intensities and humidity were similar in both years beginning of March, but the outdoor daytime temperatures were higher in 2014 on the first four days of the experiment (Fig. 1), indicating that the PS-II activity decrease mainly correlated with temperature sensitivity.. On day 18 and 20 of the March experiment, the temperatures decreased slightly below 0C (2.4 and 1.8C) in 2015, but were 3.811C in 2014 (Fig. 1). On day 21, all accessions, except Ms-0, showed at least slightly higher maximum quantum yields of PS-II (FV/FM) in the cold-pretreated plants in 2015 (Fig. 4 Top). In the accessions with intermediate ability to acclimate to cold288, namely WS, Col-0 and Van-0, PS-II was higher, if the plants were cold-treated before they were transferred to the field (Fig. 4 Top). The cold pretreatment stronger affected PS-II than FV/FM, demonstrating that it mainly supported light-dependent activity regulation of PS-II. In the 2014 plant sets, various cold-pretreated plants showed higher FV/FM and higher PS-II values still after three weeks (Fig. 4 Top).. For comparison of the cold-priming effect between the accessions, first the PS-II values were normalized on the FV/FM values. Afterwards, the results for cold-pretreated plants (C) were divided by the results for nave plants (N) ([PS-II/(FV/FM)]C/[PS-II/(FV/FM)]N) (Fig. 4 Bottom). In 2015, the plants faced cold on day 20 of the March experiment after a warmer period (Fig. 1). On the next day, [PS-II/(FV/FM)]C/[PS-II/(FV/FM)]N was lower in the three accessions with higher cold acclimation potential than in the other accessions. In 2014, the temperatures were more stable and higher end of March. The [PS-II/(FV/FM)]C/[PS-II/(FV/FM)]N effect of 2015 was almost perfectly inverted in 2014 (rP=0.980) (Fig. 4 Bottom), highlighting the reciprocity of costs and benefits of the cold pretreatment relative to the necessity of cold acclimation in the environment.. . . May. In May, despite approximately more than 15-fold higher radiation than in the growth chamber, FV/FM and PS-II were only slightly decreased 24h after transfer of the plants into the field (Fig. 2 right), but the FV/FM and PS-II values were significantly (ANOVA, p<0.01) lower in nave plants of all accessions, except in N13, Van-0 and Cvi-0, which have highest and lowest cold-acclimation potential (Table 1). In the greenhouse, like in March, at least slightly higher FV/FM were observed in nave plants of all accessions and higher PS-II values in the accessions WS, Col-0, Van-0 and Cvi-0.. The FV/FM and PS-II values also quickly increased in May in the field (Fig. 3 right). On day 2 and day 3 in the 2015 experiment, when the daytime temperatures had reached 20C (Fig. 1), the quantum yields of PS-II transiently decreased in not cold-pretreated Kas-1 (Fig. 3 right). Similar, but slighter transient decreases were observed for the other two accessions with high cold acclimation potential, N13 and Ms-0, on day 3 of the experiment.. . . . Effects of cold pretreatment on the leaf areas. Leaf area expansion is only partly genetically fixed33 and modulated e.g. by the extent of photosynthetic carbon assimilation, which also impacts on the reproductive fitness3435. In Arabidopsis, the leaves expand strongest between the 8-leaves-stage (stage 1.0836) and bolting (stage 536). Here, we compared the areas of the largest leaves in the rosettes three weeks after transferring the plants to the field and to the greenhouse (Fig. 5 left). These leaves were formed during the pre-cultivation period, but were not fully developed at the time-point of the transfer. By average, the leaf areas of cold-pretreated plants expanded 2.91-fold in the field in the March plant set and 6.04-fold in the greenhouse. In plants transferred to the field in March, the leaf blades of nave plants, except N13, were at least 50% smaller than in the greenhouse.. In May, the differences between greenhouse and field grown plants were less pronounced (Fig. 5 left). The leaves expanded 67-fold within the first three weeks in both growth regimes in 2015. In 2014, when the temperatures were lower than in 2015 in the first days of the May experiment (Fig. 1), leaf expansion was as restricted as in the March transferred plants. However, in general, cold-primed plants had at least slightly larger leaf areas in the field and smaller ones in the greenhouse (Fig. 5 left).. The quotient of the value in cold treated plants and the value in nave plants [C-value/N-value] shows the priming effect. It was similar in all field-cultivated accessions in the May experiment (Fig. 6 top). In the March experiment, stronger priming effects were observed in WS, Ms-0, Col-0, Van-0 and Cvi-0 than in N13 and Kas-1, which are the accessions with the highest and third highest cold acclimation potential (Table 1). In N13 and Kas-1 only slightly higher priming effects on the leaf blade size were observed showing that strong cold acclimation counteracts the priming effect.. . . Effects of cold pretreatment on the leaf and petiole lengths. The length of the longest leaf was determined as an additional morphogenetic parameter summarizing light, metabolite and hormonal regulation37 (Fig. 5 right). In the field, the leaves of cold-pretreated Ms-0, WS, Van-0 and Cvi-0 were longer than the leaves of nave plants in the March experiments. In the greenhouse, no effect was observed in 2014 and longer leaves for WS, Van-0 and Cvi-0 in 2015. The petioles were also slightly longer in cold-treated plants in the field, but the effect was not significant due to high variation between individual leaves (data not shown).. In the May data set, also a trend towards longer leaves was observed after cold pretreatment, but the data were also not significant due to higher variability. In the greenhouse, N13 and WS showed trends to longer leaves in nave plants.. . . Consequences of cold pretreatment on bolting. In regions with cold- and/or drought-restricted vegetation periods, the speed of bolting induction can be a critical factor for plant fitness3839. Bolting visibly marks the transition from vegetative growth to regenerative growth. It affects leaf expansion, root growth, nutrient uptake and the seed number4041. As a measure for bolting induction, we determined the time until the plants had formed at least 1cm long inflorescences (Fig. 7).. In the March experiments, cold-pretreated plants bolted 34 weeks earlier in the greenhouse than in the field. Cold-pretreatment at least slightly accelerated bolting in the field. In the greenhouse, it promoted bolting in the accessions with higher cold acclimation potential (N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 in both years and in 2015 also in WS and Col-0) (Fig. 7), while Van-0 and Can-0 did not show a priming response on bolting.. In the May experiment (Fig. 7), cold-pretreated Ms-0 and N13 bolted faster than nave plants in the greenhouse. In the field, these accessions did not show significant differences in 2014. On the contrary, Van-0 and Cvi-0, which have a low cold-acclimation potential (Table 1), bolted earlier if they were cold-pretreated. In 2015, when the temperatures and the humidity were lower than in 2014 (Suppl. 1), N13, Ms-0, Kas-1 and WS bolted earlier in the field if they were cold-primed (Fig. 7 bottom).. . . Consequences of cold pretreatment on plant fitness. Arabidopsis thaliana is a typical r-selected organism42: It generates high numbers of small seeds to improve its fitness in habitats with variable environmental conditions. Alternatively, plants can improve their fitness by producing larger and/or heavier seeds, which support the embryo and the seedling with more energy resources43. Natural variation of seed size and weight in Arabidopsis is well-known in literature4344. The total seed mass is negatively correlated with the number of seeds produced and positively correlated with seedling survival45. Here, we quantified the seed mass of individual seeds and, as a mixed parameter for fecundity and quality, the total seed number.. Kas-1 and Cvi-0, which originate from higher altitudes, formed generally slightly heavier seeds, but the cold pretreatment did not affect the individual seed weight in any accession (Fig. 8). However, cold-primed plants of all accessions formed more seeds in the field in the March and in the May experiments. In the greenhouse, only the strongest cold-adapted accessions N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 (Table 1) produced more seeds (Fig. 8).. To differentiate pretreatment specific and adaptation dependent acclimation effects, the overall fitness effects were compared by normalizing the total seed weight in cold-pretreated plants on the total seed weight in nave plants (seed weight of C-plants/ seed weight of N-plants) (Fig. 6 bottom). In the March planted series, the two accessions with the lowest cold acclimation potential, Van-0 and Cvi-0, showed the strongest cold effect (Fig. 6 bottom). The strongest absolute response was observed in N13, which was the accession with the highest cold acclimation potential in this study. This result excludes a general correlation of the fitness effects with the cold acclimation potential. On the contrary, the effects of the cold pretreatment on the total seed mass almost gradually decreased from the accessions with high cold acclimation potentials to those with low ones in the May experiment (Fig. 6 bottom).. . . Correlation between seed mass and PS-II activity. To test whether the priming effect on the reproductive fitness (Fig. 8) depends on PS-II regulation, the C-values of both parameters were normalized on the N-values [C-value/N-value]. The 2015 data, which show stronger effect variation than the 2014 data (Figs 25), were analyzed for cluster phenomenons and linear correlations. Squared Euclidean distance analysis of the data pairs for seed yield and PS-II on day 1 and day 14 separated N13 and Ms-0 from the accessions with lower cold acclimation potential in the May data set (Fig. 9). The third strongly cold acclimating accession, Kas-1, was placed closest to these clusters (Fig. 9). In the four accessions with intermediate or weak cold acclimation potential, namely WS, Col-0, Van-0 and Cvi-0, the seed yield linearly correlated with the PS-II on day 1 (rP=0.731) and vaguely with PS-II on day 14 (rP=0.304) (Fig. 9).. In the March data sets squared Euclidean distance analysis did not support separation of stronger and weaker cold acclimatible accessions in distinct clusters. Correlation analysis for the stronger cold acclimating accessions N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 and for the four other accessions showed high negative linear correlation (rP=0.950 for Cvi-0, Van-0, Col-0 and WS and rP=0.925 for N13, Kas-1 and Ms-0) between the priming effect on the seed yields and the priming effect on PS-II on the first day in the field (Fig. 9). For N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 a similar difference in PS-II between cold-pretreated and nave plants resulted in lower seed yields. The correlation lines of the two groups of accession was almost parallel shifted and separated the accessions into two regulatory units.. The leaf area after 3 weeks in the field almost perfectly correlated (rP=0.999) with the total seed mass of nave plants in the March experiments. The correlation was lost in the cold-adapted accessions (N13, Ms-0, Kas-1) and almost fully inverted (rP=0.841) in the other accessions for the priming effects [C-value/N-value] on the leaf areas and the seed yields (Fig. 9 bottom left). In the May experiment, variation of the leaf areas was very low (Fig. 9 Bottom right). Ms-0 and N13 clustered separately from the other accessions due to slightly higher seed yields (Fig. 9 Bottom right).. . . . Discussion. . Costs and benefits of cold pretreatment under stable environmental conditions. According to the allocation cost theories, attribution of energy and metabolites into defense and acclimation limit growth and reproduction464748. The costs of the cold pretreatment can be observed if acclimated plants are transferred to non-stress conditions. Here, cold pretreatment resulted in smaller leaf blades and (except in March 2014) in shorter leaves in the greenhouse in various accessions (Fig. 5) indicating resource restriction49. The seed numbers or seed weights were not decreased (Fig. 8) demonstrating that the cold pretreatment impacted not on the reproductive fitness.. The accessions N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 hardly produced seeds in the greenhouse without cold pretreatment (Fig. 8; greenhouse data). These accessions originate from areas with shorter vegetation periods and long cold winters (Table 1) and have stronger vernalization dependent alleles of FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C) and FRI (FRIGIDA)550. FLC and FRI control meristem transition51 and support cold acclimation53852. The release of osmolytes, e.g. trehalose5354, also supports meristem transition and induces bolting. N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 accumulate more osmolytes in the cold than the other accessions8. The fast release of higher amounts of osmolytes upon early deacclimation8 provides a stronger metabolite flux in the cold-pretreated plants in the greenhouse. In the field, the accessions also flowered efficiently without cold-pretreatment. N-plants of the accessions N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 formed similar or even more seeds in the field than cold-pretreated plants in the greenhouse did (Fig. 8).. . . Effect of cold pretreatment on bolting in the field. In May, the plants were exposed to long-day conditions in the field similar to the greenhouse illumination regime, but the temperatures were lower, especially during the nights (Fig. 1). While photoperiod sensing should have supported meristem transition555657, bolting was only slightly (May 2015) or not promoted (May 2014) in the accessions with high cold acclimation potential (N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1). Low night temperatures in combination with diurnal temperature variations activate cold acclimation stronger than continuous cold stress does7. Decreased conveyance of osmolytes into cold acclimation can explain the delay in bolting based on the allocation cost theories464748.. As shown in the Arabidopsis mutant gigantea and by application of ascorbate, stronger antioxidant protection delays flowering585960. At low temperatures, ascorbate accumulates and the genes for ascorbate and glutathione regenerating enzymes are expressed stronger102461. Consistent with the bolting effect (Fig. 7), the more cold adapted accessions decrease the ascorbate pool size more slowly after cold acclimation than the accessions with lower cold acclimation potential24.. . . Benefits of cold adaptation on the reproductive fitness. Cold-pretreated plants produced more seeds than nave ones in the field in the May experiment (Fig. 8). The effect was widely independent from changes in the leaf area and the photosynthetic activity (Figs 2 and 5). The total seed mass in cold-pretreated plants relative to that in nave plants (C/N-ratio) gradually decreased from the accessions with higher cold acclimation potentials to the accessions with the lower ones (Fig. 6 bottom). The best cold adapted accessions N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 activate the CBF-regulon stronger in the cold8. Either directly or via its upstream regulator ICE1, cold impacts on the circadian clock, FLC-regulation and hormone, redox and phytochrome signaling626364 and controls stress protection, which supports the reproductive fitness6566. The trend observed here is consistent with a large body of literature demonstrating that cold acclimation supports the reproductive fitness in the field.. . . Costs of a high cold acclimation potential. Harsher weather conditions (Fig. 1) caused stronger effects in the field in March than in May (Figs 26). As frequently reported in literature (for review: refs 11 and 18), cold-pretreated plants benefit in the cold from previous cold acclimation by better PS-II protection (Fig. 2 left). In our study, FV/FM decreased on the first and/or second day after transfer of the plants to the field in nave N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 (Fig. 2 left) demonstrating weaker stabilization of PS-II activity against natural environmental conditions with e.g. light and temperature fluctuations. The other accessions did not show the effect. Lower PS-II activity in the best cold adapted accessions demonstrated costs of cold acclimation. The difference in the dynamic of PS-II activity recovery (Fig. 3 left) is not linked to regulation of photosynthetic electron transport as cold acclimation results in more efficient QA oxidation67. Weaker expression of plastid antioxidant enzymes in the cold24 increases the risk for photodamage6869 and inhibits PS-II697071. Here, PS-II was inhibited stronger in nave plants, if the plants were exposed to the field conditions (Fig. 2 left). Recovery often includes proteolytic digestion, protein de novo synthesis and photosystem re-assembly72. These processes take time and are temperature sensitive73. The weaker chloroplast antioxidant protection in accessions with a higher cold acclimation potential24 delays the recovery of PS-II activity and can explain the slower response in N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 (Fig. 3 left).. . . Differentiating cold acclimation and cold priming responses. The benefit of the cold-pretreatment on the seed yield was higher in the best and also in the worst cold-adapting accessions, after the plants were transferred to the field in March (Fig. 6 bottom). The two-directional effect indicates an overlay of two parallel acting seed yield supporting mechanisms. As shown recently under growth chamber conditions in the Arabidopsis accession Col-010, protection by cold acclimation is accompanied by independently regulated priming effects, such as mitigating chloroplast ROS signaling and strengthening pleiotropic stress responses. In contrast to acclimation, priming is not coupled to the persistence of a stressful situation. Priming is defined as a mechanism transmitting information on a previous stress over a stress-free period74. Comparison of 24h and 14 day long cold pretreated plants demonstrated that the response to cold priming decreases if the first stress stimulus is long enough to activate cold acclimation10. We concluded that cold priming is antagonized by cold acclimation10. Cold-pretreated accessions showed better PS-II activity stabilization than nave plants after 3 weeks (Fig. 4) demonstrating positive cold priming effects in the field (Fig. 4). PS-II activity was indistinguishable from that in nave plants already 1 week after the transfer (Fig. 3 left). One day before the chlorophyll-a fluorescence analysis (day 20), the plants faced a triggering stimulus after a cold-free period (Fig. 1; Suppl. 1). Consistent with the definition of priming74 and with the previous hypothesis that priming acts independently from cold acclimation and is of importance in nature in spring10, the cold pretreatment resulted in higher PS-II in the intermediate cold-adapted accessions WS, Col-0 and Van-0 than in the most cold-adapted accessions N13, Ms-0 and Kas-1 (Fig. 4). The priming memory depends on post-stress regulation of the chloroplast antioxidant system, which stabilizes PS-II activity7576. It antagonizes chloroplast-to-nucleus ROS signaling, while chloroplast-independent ROS signaling is unaffected10. A triggering stress induces pleiotropic stress protection stronger in primed plants10. Here, the priming effect on the total seed mass correlated negatively with the priming effect on PS-II at day 1 after the transfer into the field (Fig. 9; March) demonstrating that the protective effect is independent from the direct effect of cold acclimation, but controlled by priming-induced regulation.. . . . Conclusion. Cold pretreatment supported the reproductive fitness in all tested accessions in the field, regardless whether the plants were transferred in March or in May. In March, the effect on the total seed mass was linked to stabilization of PS-II. In the plants transferred in May, it negatively correlated with the cold acclimation potential independent of effects on PS-II activity, which excludes metabolite allocation and metabolite signaling effects. The March transferred plants experienced cold in the field. In this plant group, the cold-pretreatment supported the seed yield the most in the two accessions with the lowest cold acclimation potential, Van-0 and Cvi-0. Higher PS-II after 3 weeks in the field furthermore demonstrated that accessions with weaker cold acclimation potential benefited more from cold acclimation than accessions with high, adapted cold tolerance.. . . Methods. . Plant material and growth conditions. The Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0 (INRA Accession ID 186AV), Cvi-0 (166AV), Kas-1 (434AV), Ms-0 (93AV), N13 (266AV), Van-0 (161AV) and WS (84 AV) were propagated in the greenhouse. The seeds of parallelly grown plant sets of 60 (2014) and 160 plants per accession were stratified in darkness for three days at 4C on Arabidopsis soil (70 volumes Topferde (Einheitserde, Germany), 70 volumes Pikiererde (Einheitserde, Germany), 25 volumes Perligran Classic (Knauf, Germany) supplemented with 0.5gl1 dolomite lime (Deutsche Raiffeisen-Warenzentrale, Germany)) and watered with 0.5gl1 Axoris Insekten-frei (COMPO, Germany) prior to transfer to a climate-controlled chamber with a day/night rhythm of 10h at 202C and 120 mol photons m2 s1 light (L36W/840 Lumilux Cool White fluorescent tubes) and 14h at 182C in darkness at 605% relative humidity. At an age of 28 days, half of the plants were transferred to 4C and cultivated for 14 days in the 10h light/14h dark rhythm with the same illumination, aeration settings and humidity as in the growth chamber. Up to this point of the experiment, the cultivation conditions were identical to those used in the LTC (long term cold) data set in the previous study10.. 15 (2014) and 35 (2015) cold-pretreated plants (C) and the same numbers of untreated (nave) plants (N) per accession were transferred to the field (Fig. 10). For optimal soil contact, the pots were removed. The field areas were covered with a natural weed vegetation prior to the experiment. They have not been treated with any fertilizer or herbicide for at least 5 years and were prepared by 2025cm deep ploughing one week before the experiments were started. Slug interference was minimized by application of Mesurol Schneckenkorn pellets (Bayer, Germany). The same numbers of the cold-treated and nave plants were transferred to a temperature (20C during the 14h long day period and 18C during the night), light intensity (illumination with 55 klux with Philips SON-T AGRO, if the external light intensity was <50 klux during the day phase, and activation of shading, if the external light intensity was >55 klux, which corresponds to 100120mol photons m2 s1 on plant rosette level) and humidity controlled (45% relative humidity) greenhouse. The position of accessions and treatments were randomized between and inside the trays and baskets. The plants were cultivated in the field and in the greenhouse until the end of the seed harvest (Fig. 8). Data from plants, which were damaged during the experiment, were removed from the data set. For the final data analysis, only data obtained with the same plants were used.. . . Chlorophyll-a fluorescence analysis. The maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (FV/FM=(FMF0)/FM) and the effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII = =(FMF0)/FM), were determined by chlorophyll-a fluorescence analysis using a MINI-PAM fluorimeter (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany)3277 and Dark leaf clips DLC-8 (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). The measurement was started with open leaf clips at 10:30 a.m. by determination of PSII in the center of one leaf half of the largest leaf with a 0.8s long saturating light flash (>3000mol photons m2 s1). The leaf clips were placed in 25sec intervals on the various plants. The measurements were started with determination of PSII. 20min after closing the leaf clips for dark acclimatization, FV/FM was determined in the various plants in the same rhythm as determination of PSII on the same leaf and the same position. Afterwards, the leaf clips were removed.. . . Plant imaging analysis. Top views of the plants were taken weekly with a digital camera in the field and greenhouse. The pictures were analyzed with the ImageJ software package78 for the leaf length and petiole length in mm and the leaf area in mm2.. . . Determination of seed numbers and seed weight. The inflorescences were bagged in cellophane before the first siliques opened (Fig. 10C and D). The seeds were air-dried in the bags for 4 weeks at room temperature. After cleaning them from attached petals, sepals and silique valves, the seeds were incubated in the dark and at room temperature for 6 more weeks, before the total seed mass per plant (n=15) and the average individual seed weight were determined by weighting all seeds and three aliquots of 100200 seeds on a digital balance (ABT320-4B, Kern & Sohn GmbH, Germany). The exact seed number was determined for each aliquot of seeds originating from 67 plants used in the chlorophyll-a fluorescence analysis on digital images using the Analyze particles function of the software package ImageJ78. The parameter Size was set to 6150 and the Circularity to 0.71.0 for counting. The individual seed weights were calculated by dividing the seed weight of the aliquots by the number of seeds counted in the respective aliquot. The total number of seeds per plant was calculated from the total seed weight and the mean individual seed weight in the same batch.. . . Weather data. The air temperature and the relative air humidity were determined 2m above the ground and the global radiation was obtained at the meteorological station Dahlem of the Free University of Berlin (Institut fr Meteorologie der Freien Universitt Berlin, Germany) 610m east and 750m southeast of the site. All parameters were recorded at one-minute intervals from the beginning of March to the time of the last harvest. For the figures, one-hour-mean values were calculated. Additionally, in the field, the quantum flux (quantum flux [mol quanta m2 s1]=radiation [Wm2] [nm]0.836102) was recorded with a MQ-200 quantum flux meter (Apogee Electronics, Santa Monica CA, U.S.A.) and the air temperature and humidity controlled with a Voltcraft DL-121TH data logger (Voltcraft, Switzerland) several times during the experiment for comparison.. . . Statistical analyses. The ANOVA (Turkey Post-hoc test), cluster analysis (squared Euclidean distance; cluster number set to 25 clusters) and Pearson correlation analyses were carried out at <0.05 using R (version 3.2.2, Vienna, Austria), SPSS 22 and 23 (IBM Armonk U.S.A.) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, U.S.A.).. . . .

PMC5362595	Introduction. During the floral transition in flowering plants, the vegetative shoot apical meristem that produces leaves is transformed into the inflorescence meristem that produces flowers. This process is controlled by flowering regulatory networks in response to various environmental and endogenous signals, and the underlying molecular mechanisms have been intensively studied in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In Arabidopsis, environmental and endogenous flowering signals perceived by various genetic pathways mediate transcriptional regulation of two major floral pathway integrators, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), which in turn activate two floral meristem identity genes, APETALA1 (AP1) and LEAFY (LFY), to regulate the specification and formation of floral meristems on the flank of the shoot apical meristem (Kardailsky et al., 1999; Kobayashi et al., 1999; Blazquez and Weigel, 2000; Lee et al., 2000; Samach et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2009).. AP1 encodes a MADS-box transcription factor that not only specifies the floral meristem identity, but also contributes to determination of the identity of perianth floral organs in Arabidopsis (Irish and Sussex, 1990; Mandel et al., 1992; Bowman et al., 1993). When the activity of AP1 is lost, floral meristems that would normally develop into flowers are partially converted into inflorescence meristems. In ap1 mutants, flowers exhibited transformation of sepals into leaf-like organs and failure of petal development. In contrast, overexpression of AP1 results in early flowering and transformation of inflorescence meristems into floral meristems (Mandel and Yanofsky, 1995). During the floral transition, AP1 expression is directly activated by LFY and a protein complex consisting of FT and FD (Wagner et al., 1999; Abe et al., 2005; Wigge et al., 2005). In emerging floral meristems, AP1 plays dual functions as an activator and a repressor. It activates B class homeotic genes to mediate the specification of petals (Hill et al., 1998; Ng and Yanofsky, 2001), while it also suppresses a group of flowering time genes to prevent the reversion of floral meristems into inflorescence meristems (Yu et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2007; Kaufmann et al., 2010). Moreover, AP1 directly regulates the homeostasis of cytokinin by suppressing its biosynthesis and activating its degradation to establish determinate floral meristems (Han et al., 2014).. So far AP1 orthologs have been isolated in a wide range of plant species, such as pea (Pisum sativum) (Berbel et al., 2001), apple (Malus domestica) (Kotoda et al., 2002), common wheat (Triticum aestivum) (Adam et al., 2007), moth orchid (Phalaenopsis Hatsuyuki) (Song et al., 2011), longan (Dimocarpus longan) (Winterhagen et al., 2013), trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.) (Sun et al., 2014), Birch (Betula platyphylla) (Huang et al., 2014) and poplar (Populus tomentosa) (Chen et al., 2015). Through mainly examining their expression patterns and their effects on heterologous systems, most of these genes have been suggested to affect either the flowering process or floral organ formation.. Dendrobium is one of the largest genera in the family Orchidaceae, which is one of the largest families of angiosperms (Teixeira da Silva et al., 2014). The Dendrobium genus comprises more than 1200 species, and its members have attractive ornamental and medicinal values (Yu and Goh, 2001; Teixeira da Silva et al., 2014). The high demand of Dendrobium orchids has enabled Dendrobium growers to create many varieties and hybrids with various floral traits. However, the long vegetative phase and low survival rate of orchid seedlings under natural environmental conditions make it difficult to propagate and breed Dendrobium orchids (Yu and Goh, 2001; Chai and Yu, 2007; Wang et al., 2009). Therefore, it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the floral transition in orchids so as to identify appropriate regulators for targeted manipulation or screening of orchid traits. Recent studies have isolated and characterized several orthologs of Arabidopsis floral pathway integrators in orchids. Overexpression of three orthologs of FT, OnFT, DnFT and CgFT from Oncidium, Dendrobium, and Cymbidium orchids, respectively, causes early flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis or tobacco plants (Hou and Yang, 2009; Li et al., 2012; Xiang et al., 2012). In addition, overexpression of DOSOC1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis SOC1, promotes flowering in both transgenic Arabidopsis and Dendrobium orchids (Ding et al., 2013).. In this study, we isolated an AP1 ortholog, DOAP1, from Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile, and characterized its function through examining its expression patterns and investigating its biological effects in both transgenic Arabidopsis and orchid plants. Our results suggest that DOAP1 may play a conserved role in promoting flowering and floral meristem development in the Orchidaceae family.. . . Materials and Methods. . Plant Material and Growth Conditions. Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile (a hybrid of Dendrobium Pinky and Dendrobium Kiyomi Beauty) plants were grown in pots in the greenhouse at 28  4C under natural lighting conditions. In our in vitro culture system for Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile, protocorms developing from seeds were used as the starting materials. They were cultured in modified liquid Knudson C (KC) medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) sucrose, 15% (v/v) coconut water and 4.4 M benzyladenine (BA) at 24C under a 16-h photoperiod on rotary shakers at 120 rpm (Yu and Goh, 2000a; Ding et al., 2013). Plantlets at the floral transitional stage were transferred to the two-layer modified KC medium as previously described (Hee et al., 2007; Sim et al., 2007). Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and 35S:DOAP1 transgenic plants in both wild-type and ap1-10 Col-0 backgrounds were grown under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) at 23  2C.. . . Isolation of DOAP1. Total RNA was extracted from inflorescences of Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN). To isolate the putative AP1 orthologs, two degenerate primers, 5-CAGCTGARGCGRATMGAGAAC-3 and 5-GCKMAGCATCCAWGGYGG-3, were manually designed based on the conserved regions among AP1 orthologs in various plant species. Based on the partial cDNA sequence obtained, the full-length cDNA of DOAP1 was further amplified using the SMARTERTM RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech).. . . Sequence Analysis. Protein sequences of AP1-like genes were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Alignment of amino acid sequences was performed using the Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment program1 and BOXSHADE 3.212. The phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining algorithm using the MEGA6 software3.. . . Expression Analysis. Total RNA was extracted from orchids or Arabidopsis plants using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN), and reverse-transcribed using the SuperScriptTM II Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Real-time PCR reaction was performed in triplicates on the CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with the SYBR Green Master Mix (Toyobo). UBIQUITIN (DOUbi) in Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile was used as a reference gene (Ding et al., 2013). Calculation of relative gene expression levels was performed as previously reported (Liu et al., 2007). Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out as previously reported (Xu et al., 2006) using either Arabidopsis -TUBLIN2 (TUB2) or orchid ACTIN (DOActin) as a reference gene.. . . Arabidopsis Transformation. The full-length DOAP1 cDNA fragment was cloned into pGreen0229-35S under the control of two CaMV 35S promoters (Yu et al., 2004). The resulting construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 competent cells by electroporation. 35S:DOAP1 transgenic Arabidopsis lines were created by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and selected by 0.3 g/L Basta on soil.. . . Orchid Transformation by Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation. Genetic transformation of Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile was performed according to the reported L-methionine sulfoximine (MSO) selection system with minor modifications (Yu et al., 2001; Chai et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2013). Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile calli were cut into small pieces 35 mm in diameter and then cultured in modified KC liquid medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) sucrose, 15% (v/v) coconut water and 4.4 M BA. Agrobacterium pellet was re-suspended in KC liquid medium to be co-cultivated with prepared orchid calli. Acetosyringone (100 M) was added to induce transformation. After co-cultivation for 2 h, calli were placed on solid KC medium in the dark for three nights. Agrobacterium-infected calli were rinsed by water containing 200 mg/L cefotaxime to remove the bacteria, and grown on solid KC medium containing 0.5 M MSO as a selection agent. Surviving calli were subcultured onto fresh solid medium every 20 days. After four rounds of MSO selection, green calli were transferred to modified KC solid medium containing 2 M MSO for lethal selection. After three rounds of selection, putative surviving transgenic lines were cultured on modified KC solid medium for further investigation.. . . Southern Blot. Genomic DNA isolated from wild-type and 35S:DOAP1 transgenic orchids was digested by EcoRI for 16 h, resolved on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels, and then transferred onto nylon membranes. Blots were hybridized overnight with the specific digoxigenin-labeled DNA, washed and detected in accordance with the manufacturers instructions (DIG Application Manual for Filter Hybridization, Roche) as previously reported (Yu and Goh, 2000b).. . . . Results. . Isolation of DOAP1 from Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile. To isolate AP1-like genes from Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile, we designed a pair of degenerate primers based on the conserved amino acid sequences of AP1 orthologs in various plant species. A partial cDNA fragment was obtained by reverse transcription PCR using RNA extracted from inflorescence apices of Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile. Since this fragment showed high sequence similarity with other AP1-like genes, we further designed primers based on this fragment and obtained the corresponding full-length cDNA sequence, designated DOAP1 (GenBank accession No. KY471451), using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method.. DOAP1 cDNA is 897 bp in length with a 639 bp coding region. The deduced DOAP1 amino acid sequence contains a highly conserved MADS domain and a less conserved K domain, and a diverse C terminal region as found in other AP1-like genes from various plant species (Figure 1). Multiple sequence alignment showed that DOAP1 shared the highest sequence identity with other orchid AP1 orthologs, such as CeAP1 (Cymbidium ensifolium; 69.95% identity) and PjAP1 (Phalaenopsis japonica; 62.56% identity). DOAP1 also had higher sequence identity with monocot AP1 orthologs, such as TaAP1 (Triticum aestivum; 58% identity), OsAP1 (Oryza sativa; 56.72% identity) and ZmAP1 (Zea mays; 54.59% identity), than Arabidopsis AP1 (53.3% identity).. . FIGURE 1. . Alignment of the amino acid sequences of DOAP1 and its orthologs from other plant species. Conserved residues are shown in black, while similar residues are shown in gray. Dashes indicate gaps to maximize alignment. The conserved MADS and K domains are indicated. The species names are shown behind their corresponding protein names as follows: DOAP1, Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile; CeAP1, Cymbidium ensifolium; PjAP1: Phalaenopsis japonica; ZmAP1, Zea mays; OsAP1, Oryza sativa; LpAP1, Lolium perenne; TaAP1, Triticum aestivum; AP1, Arabidopsis thaliana; MdAP1, Malus domestica; CsAP1, Citrus sinensis; PtAP1, Populus trichocarpa; PsAP1, Paeonia suffruticosa; VuAP1, Vigna unguiculata; ZjAP1, Ziziphus jujube; DlAP1, Dimocarpus longan; VvAP1, Vitis vinifera; NnAP1, Nelumbo nucifera; PaAP1, Persea Americana; MgAP1, Magnolia grandiflora. Non-AP1-like proteins that are encoded by other MADS-box subfamily genes were used as outlier in this alignment as follows: DEFICIENS-AGAMOUS-LIKE2 (DAL2) of Picea abies, and two SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1)-like proteins from Rosa hybrid cultivar (RosaSOC1) and Picea abies (PaSOC1).. . . . To determine the evolutionary relationship between DOAP1 and other AP1-like proteins from other plant species, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the analysis of amino acid sequences of MIK regions (Figure 2). The tree showed that DOAP1 was clustered together with other orchid AP1-like proteins, such as OMADS10 (Chang et al., 2009) and DOMADS2 (Yu and Goh, 2000b), in the monocotyledonous subgroup of SQUA that includes AP1-like proteins isolated from monocots (Purugganan et al., 1995; Theissen et al., 1996).. . FIGURE 2. . Phylogenetic tree of AP1/AGL9 -like MADS-box proteins. Amino acid sequences of AP1/AGL9 like MADS box genes were obtained from the NCBI database. DOAP1 investigated in this study is highlighted in blue. The multiple sequence alignment was performed via Clustal Omega. The tree was constructed with MEGA6 using the neighbor-joining method. Genus names of respective species are given in the parentheses behind the corresponding protein names. Bootstrap values (>50%) in 1,000 replicates are shown below the nodes.. . . . . . DOAP1 Expression Pattern in Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile. To study the expression pattern of DOAP1 in Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile, cDNA was synthesized from RNA extracted from various orchid tissues, including leaves, roots, inflorescence apices, floral buds at different stages (stages 13, at which buds were 0.51 cm, 12 cm, and over 2 cm in length, respectively), half-bloomed flowers and fully bloomed flowers (Figure 3A). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that DOAP1 transcripts were detected at the highest level in inflorescence apices and at the lowest level in roots (Figure 3B). Notably, DOAP1 expression was significantly higher in inflorescence apices than in vegetative shoot apices. Moreover, DOAP1 expression gradually increased in developing floral buds at various stages and half-bloomed flowers, but decreased afterward in fully bloomed flowers (Figure 3B). These expression patterns indicate that DOAP1 function may be closely associated with flowering time control and flower development in Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile.. . FIGURE 3. .

DOAP1 Promotes Flowering and Partially Complements ap1 Mutants in Arabidopsis. In order to investigate the biological function of DOAP1, we firstly generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring the DOAP1 coding sequence driven by the CaMV 35S promoter. Among 50 independent 35S:DOAP1 transgenic lines created at the T1 generation, 46 lines showed an early flowering phenotype typically producing only 57 rosette leaves as compared to wild-type plants, which developed 912 rosette leaves under long day conditions (Figures 4A,B). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR using DOAP1-specific primers confirmed that DOAP1 was overexpressed in a representative 35S:DOAP1 transgenic Arabidopsis line with a single T-DNA insertion (Figure 4C), implying that the early flowering phenotype of 35S:DOAP1 is associated with overexpression of DOAP1. In addition to the defect in flowering time, the inflorescence meristems of 35S:DOAP1 transgenic lines usually terminated as flowers after producing only a few flowers, while these flowers produced floral organs indistinguishable from those of wild-type flowers (Figures 4D,E), suggesting that overexpression of DOAP1 promotes the formation of floral meristems, but does not affect floral organ identity in Arabidopsis.. . FIGURE 4. . Overexpression of DOAP1 in Arabidopsis results in early flowering. (A) Flowering time of 35S:DOAP1 in wild-type and ap1-10 backgrounds. The left panel shows the distribution of flowering time in T1 transgenic lines harboring 35S:DOAP1 in wild-type and ap1-10 backgrounds grown under long day conditions, while the right panel shows the average flowering time of various transgenic lines. Error bars, mean  SD. Asterisks indicate statistically significantly differences in flowering time of 35S:DOAP1 and ap1-10 35S:DOAP1 compared to wild-type and ap1-10, respectively (two-tailed paired Students t-test, p < 0.05).

(E) plants, whereas deficiency in petal formation in ap1-10. (F) was partially rescued in ap1 35S:DOAP1. (G). Red arrowheads indicate petals in ap1 35S:DOAP1. Bars represent 5 mm.. . . . We further performed Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to introduce 35S:DOAP1 into ap1-10 mutants, which were generated from ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized populations of Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Schultz and Haughn, 1993), to examine whether DOAP1 could complement the loss function of AP1. While ap1-10 exhibited comparable flowering time to wild-type plants, most of the ap1-10 35S:DOAP1 lines flowered much earlier than wild-type and ap1-10 plants, a flowering pattern resembling 35S:DOAP1 in the wild-type background (Figure 4A). We further identified several ap1-10 35S:DOAP1 transgenic lines with single T-DNA insertion, which consistently displayed the similar early flowering phenotype at various generations, and selected one representative line for further investigations. Like other ap1 mutants, ap1-10 showed typical defects in the identity of perianth organs, such as homeotic transformation of petals into stamens or stamen-petal chimeric structures (Figure 4F). In contrast, petal formation was restored in ap1-10 35S:DOAP1 (Figure 4G), demonstrating that DOAP1 plays the same role as AP1 in regulating petal formation in Arabidopsis. Similarly, semi-quantitative RT-PCR detected high expression of DOAP1 in the representative ap1-10 35S:DOAP1 line (Figure 4C), substantiating a causal link between the observable phenotypes and overexpression of DOAP1 in ap1-10 35S:DOAP1.. . . DOAP1 Promotes Early Formation of Inflorescences in Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile. To understand the endogenous function of DOAP1 in Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile, we created transgenic orchids bearing 35S:DOAP1 in a pGreen vector (Figure 5A) using an integrated orchid gene transformation and in vitro orchid culture system (Yu et al., 2001; Chai et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2013).. .

(B) Genetic transformation of Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile using the MSO selection system. After lethal section on the solid medium containing 2 M MSO (left panel), green surviving calli were further subcultured onto fresh medium every 20 days (right panel). (C) PCR genotyping of DOAP1 transgenic orchids shows the presence of 35S:DOAP1 transgene in nine independent lines of Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile. The specific primers from the 35S promoter and DOAP1, respectively, were designed for genotyping. The 35S:DOAP1 plasmid and the genomic DNA of wild-type orchids were used as a positive control (+ve) and a negative control (WT), respectively.. . . . After Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile calli, the transformed materials were selected on the medium containing 0.5 and 2 M MSO as a selection agent for initial and lethal selection (Figure 5B), respectively. After a total of seven rounds of selection, most of the calli turned necrotic and eventually died, while some putative transformants survived and proliferated into protocorm-like bodies, which further developed into young plantlets. We screened out nine independent 35S:DOAP1 transgenic Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile lines, and confirmed the presence of the 35S:DOAP1 transgene in these lines by PCR genotyping using the specific primers from 35S and DOAP1 (Figure 5C).. We then compared the growth status of wild-type and 35S:DOAP1 Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile plants using our established in vitro culture system (Ding et al., 2013), which allows rapid in vitro development of orchid plants from the vegetative to reproductive phase. Under our growth conditions, it took wild-type orchid plants 2530 weeks to grow from protocorm-like bodies to plantlets with the first visible inflorescence stalks (Figure 6A), whereas 8 out of 9 35S:DOAP1 transgenic lines displayed the first visible inflorescences at 1017 weeks of culture (Figures 6A,B). These phenotypes indicate a role of DOAP1 in promoting the transition of vegetative shoot apical meristems into inflorescence meristems. As compared to wild-type inflorescences (Ding et al., 2013), the inflorescence apices of these 35S:DOAP1 transgenic plants were usually terminated as floral buds immediately after producing only 12 floral buds or even without generating any other floral structure (Figure 6C), suggesting a quick transformation of inflorescence meristems into floral meristems in 35S:DOAP1. In addition, Southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of the T-DNA region containing the bialaphos resistance (bar) gene in the genome of 35S:DOAP1 #1 and #2 lines (Figure 6D), which substantiated the results showing the presence of the 35S:DOAP1 transgene in the 35S:DOAP1 genome (Figure 5C). As expected, semi-quantitative RT PCR showed that DOAP1 was overexpressed in inflorescence apices of 35S:DOAP1 transgenic orchids compared to wild-type orchids (Figure 6E). These results imply that the phenotypes of 35S:DOAP1 transgenic orchids are associated with overexpression of DOAP1 in these plants.. . FIGURE 6. . Overexpression DOAP1 in Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile causes early flowering. (A) Comparison of flowering time of wild-type and 35S:DOAP1 transgenic orchids. The left panel shows that all 9 transgenic lines produce inflorescences (indicated by the visible inflorescence stalk) earlier than 29 wild-type plants, while the right panel shows the comparison of the average time to produce visible inflorescences of 35S:DOAP1 and wild-type orchids.

Total RNA was extracted from inflorescence apices, and DOActin was amplified as an internal control.. . . . . . . Discussion. Although the Orchidaceae is one of the largest and most widespread families of flowering plants, the molecular mechanism underlying the flowering process of the members in this family remain largely unknown. The difficulty in performing molecular genetic studies on orchids is partially due to their long vegetative phase and recalcitrant nature for gene transformation. In this study, we have taken advantage of an established Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation system based on MSO selection coupled with in vitro orchid culture system (Yu et al., 2001; Hee et al., 2007; Sim et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2013) to study the biological function of a newly isolated AP1 ortholog, DOAP1, from Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile.. Our findings have provided several pieces of evidence to support that DOAP1 plays a conserved role in promoting the floral transition and specifying the identity of perianth floral organs. First, in addition to the conserved MADS and K domains found among AP1-like proteins, phylogenetic analysis has revealed that DOAP1 and other orchid AP1-like proteins are assigned to the same clade in the monocotyledonous subgroup of SQUA, which contains AP1/SQUA-like proteins from monocots (Purugganan et al., 1995; Theissen et al., 1996). Second, DOAP1 is highly expressed in inflorescence apices and flowers at various developmental stages, which is similar to the patterns exhibited by most of AP1-like genes studied (Becker and Theissen, 2003; Litt and Irish, 2003). Notably, DOAP1 is also expressed in vegetative shoot apices and upregulated in inflorescence apices, suggesting that it could be one of the earliest regulatory genes that promote the floral transition in orchids. Third, overexpression of DOAP1 in both Arabidopsis and orchids causes early flowering and early termination of inflorescence meristems as floral meristems, which are similar to the effects of overexpression of AP1 in Arabidopsis (Mandel and Yanofsky, 1995), indicating that like AP1, DOAP1 may serve as a floral meristem identity gene to promote the specification of floral meristems in both Arabidopsis and orchids. Similarly, overexpression of AP1 orthologs from other plant species also causes early flowering in transgenic plants (Berbel et al., 2001; Kotoda et al., 2002; Adam et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014), suggesting a conserved role of AP1-like genes in accelerating flowering probably through promoting the early formation of floral meristems. Last, overexpression of DOAP1 in ap1-10 Arabidopsis mutants partially rescues the defect in petal formation, suggesting that DOAP1 and AP1 also share a similar role as class A organ identity genes (Irish and Sussex, 1990; Mandel et al., 1992; Bowman et al., 1993). Taken together, our findings suggest that DOAP1 may play evolutionarily conserved roles in promoting floral meristem formation and specification of perianth organs in the Orchidaceae family. As AP1 has been shown to prevent the formation of flowers in the axils of sepals by directly regulating the cytokinin homeostasis (Han et al., 2014), it would be interesting to investigate whether DOAP1 also has a similar role in orchids in future studies.. Despite the functional conservation of DOAP1 as discussed above, some of our results also indicate other potential functions of DOAP1 in orchid development. For example, DOAP1 is expressed in both leaves and floral buds at stage 1 almost at comparable levels (Figure 3B), implying its potential involvement in vegetative growth. In addition, there is a dramatic decrease in DOAP1 expression in fully bloomed flowers as compared to its expression in half-bloomed flowers (Figure 3B). This change could be relevant to a possible role of DOAP1 in late flower development. Consistently, several other orchid AP1-like genes also exhibit potential functions in various aspects of flower development other than their conserved roles in floral meristem development and perianth organ specification. For example, another orchid AP1-like gene, DOMADS2, isolated from Dendrobium Madame Thong-In is not only highly expressed in the shoot apical meristem during the floral transition, but also expressed in orchid reproductive organs, such as column (gynostemium, a fused structure of stigmas, styles and stamens) and ovary (Yu and Goh, 2000b), indicating that DOMADS2 may also be involved in reproductive organ development. Similarly, another AP1-like gene, EpMADS12, in Erycina pusilla is also detectable in multiple floral organs, such as lips, column, and pollinarium (Lin et al., 2016). These diverse expression patterns of AP1-like genes indicate that AP1-like genes may evolve with multiple functions in regulating flowering and flower development in orchids. Further investigation of these orchid AP1-like genes through knocking down or knocking out their expression in orchids will shed light on their endogenous functions in orchid reproductive development.. . .

PMC5364540	Plants have evolved a genome defense system that can transcriptionally inactivate repetitive DNA, such as mobile transposable elements (TEs) and transgenes. The system involves epigenetic mechanisms, including inter-dependent modifications of RNA and chromatin such as small RNA production and DNA methylation, which facilitate long-term silencing of the non-self DNA sequences1. Molecular mechanisms to establish the transcriptionally silent chromatin state of these invading DNA elements have been a major focus of investigation.. In plants, repetitive DNAs are targeted and silenced by an RNA-based mechanism called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), which induces DNA methylation of a DNA template that leads to transcriptional gene silencing (TGS)2. Two pathways of RdDM have been described: RNA polymerase IV (PolIV)-RdDM and Polymerase II (PolII)-RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6)-dependent RdDM3. PolIV is recruited to loci associated with histone H3K9 methylation (H3K9me) and transcribes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). The ssRNA becomes the template for 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNA (siRNA) after being processed by RDR2 and DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3). siRNA is loaded onto ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), which binds to non-coding scaffold RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase V (PolV). NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE E1 (NRPE1) encodes the largest subunit of PolV and NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE D2a (NRPD2a) encodes a shared subunit of RNA polymerase IV and V2. The chromatin remodeler DEFECTIVE IN RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION 1 (DRD1) is required for PolV activity. These factors recruit de novo methylase DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRNANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) to methylate repeated DNA sequences. On the other hand, in the non-canonical PolII-RDR6-dependent RdDM pathway, PolII transcribed ssRNA from repeats is converted into double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by RDR6, processed into 2122nt siRNA by DCL2 and DCL4. The siRNA is loaded into AGO6, which can be directed to the scaffold RNA transcribed by PolV, establishing and reinforcing TGS. The DNA methylation established at CG and non-CG sites is maintained through cell divisions by DNA methylases METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) and CHROMOMETHYLASEs (CMTs), and the chromatin remodeler DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1)14.. Introduction of transgenes into plant genomes by agrobacterium-mediated transformation has been widely used for random mutagenesis of genomes, generation of transgenic plants conferring particular traits, and characterisation of genes of interest. A large collection of mutagenized plant lines, that have randomly integrated Transfer DNA (T-DNA) fragments containing exogenous DNA sequences such as viral promoters and bacterial antibiotics resistant genes, have been generated for model plants including Arabidopsis thaliana5. T-DNA inserted into exons is expected to produce transcripts interrupted by T-DNA sequences that do not code for the original protein, and intronic T-DNA insertions may also disrupt gene function by affecting proper transcription and splicing.. However, it has been well known that transgenes are often targeted by the host defense mechanisms. Particularly, introduction of a second, homologous T-DNA into the genome interferes with the other T-DNAs in trans, which is accompanied with DNA hypermethylation and gene silencing of promoters and antibiotic resistance genes encoded by T-DNA, a phenomenon called trans-inactivation67. Trans-inactivation can be induced by double-transformation of T-DNAs, or also by introduction of unlinked T-DNA by sexual crossing89. More recently, a phenomenon termed T-DNA suppression has been reported, in which genes remain functional despite the presence of T-DNA insertions within the introns of genes101112. T-DNA suppression generally occurs after crossing two different T-DNA insertion mutants. There are several characteristic features of T-DNA suppression from these reports: (1) T-DNA suppression occurs after crossing two homologous T-DNA mutants (e.g., SALK T-DNA lines), (2) these mutants suppress one of the T-DNA mutant phenotypes, leaving the other mutant phenotype expressed, (3) it occurs in T-DNAs inserted into intronic regions, and (4) the suppressed state can be maintained for multiple generations in the absence of the second T-DNA that triggered the suppression. mRNA splicing machinery and DNA methylation seem to be associated with T-DNA suppression1112. Splicing out of the intronic T-DNA and a high level of endogenous transcripts were observed in the ben1-1 (BRI1-5 ENHANCED 1) T-DNA suppressed line11. Similarly, a high transcript level was observed in cob-6 (COBRA) T-DNA suppressed lines12, and both of these T-DNA suppressed lines were associated with CG and CHG methylation. Furthermore, disruption of DNA demethylation activity by loss of REPRESSOR OF SILENCING1 (ROS1) function leads to T-DNA suppression of cob-6 without the need of crossing with another T-DNA locus. Inhibition of DNA methylation by application of 5-azacytidine or zebularine, or loss of DNA methyltransferase activity resulted in the release of T-DNA suppression, re-acquiring the mutant phenotype12. Thus, epigenetic modulations of intronic T-DNA sequences have been suggested for T-DNA suppression, although detailed molecular mechanisms of induction, and maintenance of T-DNA suppression, as well as alteration of modes of gene transcription associated with suppression remain poorly understood.. This study investigated transcriptional changes in T-DNA suppressed lines and involvement of epigenetic pathways required to establish and maintain T-DNA suppression. T-DNA suppression is stably induced and maintained in intronic T-DNA mutants of the AGAMOUS (AG) and LEAFY (LFY) genes that contain >10kb intron sequences containing T-DNA insertions. We demonstrated that T-DNA suppression promotes splicing of T-DNA-containing introns, which requires heterochromatinisation of T-DNA sequences, as well as the nuclear proteins, INCREASED BONSAI METHYLATION 2 (IBM2) and ENHANCED DOWNY MILDEW 2 (EDM2). Induction of T-DNA suppression is mediated by the canonical RdDM pathway, likely in the F1 generation after sexual crossing, which was associated with extensive DNA methylation of T-DNA sequences. Our results demonstrate the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms that can mask the influence of foreign DNA intruding into transcription units.. . Results. . Establishment of intronic T-DNA suppression in the presence of additional T-DNA. To investigate the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation of intronic transgenes, we selected the Arabidopsis SALK T-DNA lines, which have T-DNA insertions in genes such as AGAMOUS, LEAFY, and GLABRA2, mutants of which show visible phenotypes (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Figs S1S3). AGAMOUS (AG) encodes a MADS domain transcription factor required for specification of stamen and carpel organs13. A previous study demonstrated that the T-DNA in SALK_014999 (ag-12; ag hereafter) inserted into the second intron of AG is suppressed in the presence of an additional T-DNA, and homozygous ag plants develop Wild-Type (WT)-like flowers10. LEAFY (LFY) is involved in floral meristem development, and lfy plant shows transformation of flowers into inflorescence shoots14, and SALK_057202 (lfy hereafter) has a T-DNA insertion in the second intron (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. S2). GLABRA2 encodes a homeodomain protein that regulates epidermal cell identity, including trichome formation15, and in the SALK_130213 (gl2-8; gl2 hereafter) line, the T-DNA is inserted into the third intron of the gene (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. S3). Southern analysis and DNA sequencing analysis of intronic T-DNA mutants showed that more than 8kb of multi-copy T-DNAs and a part of the pROK2 binary vector sequence with complex rearrangements had been inserted at each locus, which extended the intron length longer than the original gene (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Figs S13).. Suppression of the ag phenotype was induced in the F2 generation by a cross between ag and gl2, as previously reported10 (Fig. 1B,C, Table 1). We also observed suppression of the lfy phenotype in the F2 when lfy was crossed with the gl2 T-DNA line (Fig. 1B,D). In these crosses, approximately one-quarter to one-third of the F2 plants possessed homozygous T-DNA in AG, LFY, and GL2, as expected according to Mendelian segregation, but all of the F2 plants showed WT flower or inflorescence phenotypes (Table 1). These WT-like ag and lfy mutant plants containing homozygous T-DNA insertions were designated as suppressed T-DNA mutants ag* or lfy*, as previously described10. As reported101112, suppressed ag and lfy phenotypes were stably inherited for at least five generations in the absence of the additional T-DNA in the GL2 locus through self-pollination (Fig. 1C). However, we never observed suppression of the gl2 phenotype in the F2 generation of these crosses, or in subsequent generations (Table 1, and data not shown). When ag and lfy were crossed, only the lfy phenotype was suppressed in the F2 generation (Table 1). Another T-DNA inserted in an intergenic region (SALK_ 095889) did not induce T-DNA suppression of ag and lfy (Table 1). We also found that allelic crosses, i.e. ag x ag or lfy x lfy did not induce T-DNA suppression as efficiently as crosses between T-DNA lines in trans (Table 1). On the other hand, the previous study showed that ag* can convert ag allele to ag*, showing a paramutation-like phenomenon10. We also observed a similar paramutagenic effect of the lfy* allele (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results suggested that not only the presence of additional T-DNA with sequence homology (i.e. SALK T-DNAs), but also the epigenetic state of the T-DNA might be important for the induction of T-DNA suppression.. . . Intronic T-DNA suppression requires IBM2 and EDM2 to prevent ectopic 3 end processing of introns. It has been suggested that epigenetic regulation is involved in suppression of intronic T-DNA12. To test the requirement of epigenetic factors in maintenance of the suppressed epigenetic state of intronic T-DNA, the ag* and lfy* lines were crossed with non-T-DNA mutants of maintenance DNA methylation, such as met1, ddm1, and cmt3, or of the RdDM pathway such as nrpe1, nrpd2a, and rdr623 (Fig. 1B). In the F2 generation, we observed plants that regained the ag phenotype in the met1 or ddm1 backgrounds, while suppression did not require CMT3, nor RdDM factors for its maintenance (Fig. 2A). Recent studies demonstrated that efficient transcription and/or splicing of introns associated with heterochromatic epigenetic marks requires the nuclear proteins, IBM2 and EDM216171819. IBM2 contains a Bromo-Adjacent Homology (BAH) domain and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), while EDM2 contains PHD finger domains that bind to H3K9 methylation. In the ibm2 and edm2 backgrounds, ag* and lfy* homozygous plants showed severe ag and lfy phenotypes that were not observed in ibm2 or edm2 single mutants, nor in the segregating ag and lfy homozygous siblings (Fig. 2A,B). As IBM2 and EDM2 likely act downstream of repressive epigenetic marks20, these results suggest that maintenance of T-DNA suppression requires a heterochromatic state maintained by MET1 and DDM1, and that IBM2 and EDM2 promote full-length transcription of AG and LFY over introns containing suppressed T-DNA sequences.. Transcript analysis of AG before and after induction of T-DNA suppression showed that parental ag plants accumulate transcripts in the region upstream of the T-DNA insertion (exon1), while the transcript level in the 3 end of the AG coding sequence (CDS: exon 89) downstream of T-DNA insertion decreased, compared to wild-type (Fig. 3A). 3-RACE demonstrated that plants with the ag phenotype accumulated shorter transcripts containing part of the T-DNA sequence, and were prematurely polyadenylated before or within T-DNA insertion sites (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S5A). After induction of T-DNA suppression, ag* showed decreased levels of shorter transcripts terminated within the T-DNA relative to ag (Fig. 3A,B), but expressed more WT transcripts (Fig. 3C). When ag* was crossed into the ibm2 and edm2 backgrounds, the 3 end of AG expression was decreased due to premature termination of the transcript within the T-DNA region (Fig. 3A,B, Supplementary Fig. S5B). These data suggest that T-DNA suppression in AG and LFY loci is due to enhanced splicing of T-DNA-containing introns and that it requires IBM2 and EDM2 to prevent ectopic 3 end processing of the long introns containing T-DNA sequences.. . . DNA methylation covers the entire sequence of T-DNA in the suppressed state. To know whether the suppression is associated with epigenetic changes in intronic T-DNA, we examined DNA methylation in T-DNA regions with Bisulfite-sequencing (BS-seq) analysis. Single homozygous mutants of ag, lfy, and gl2 plants before and after induction of suppression were used to avoid mixing sequencing reads originating from multiple loci. Still, most of the sequence reads could be mapped to multiple regions, since multi-copy T-DNA sequences are inserted in intronic regions of AG, LFY, and GL2 loci (Supplementary Figs S13). Therefore, sequence reads were mapped to the original T-DNA region of the pROK2 vector sequence, including unique flanking regions of T-DNA insertion sites, in order to determine the average DNA methylation level over the T-DNA sequences. We found that even before induction of suppression, a large proportion of T-DNA sequences was highly methylated at both CG and non-CG sites, while still some regions remain unmethylated (Fig. 4A,B). However, suppressed T-DNAs showed hypermethylation at CG and non-CG sites throughout the sequences. Considering that an average of 85% (ag*) and 76% (lfy*) of CG methylation is induced after suppression, methylation is likely distributed evenly across multi-copy sequences of T-DNAs (Supplementary Figs S12). Especially, 5 regions of T-DNA, where premature termination of transcripts was observed (Fig. 3), was fully covered by DNA methylation in ag* and lfy* compared to non-suppressed plants (Fig. 4). In addition, DNA methylation was spread into the flanking regions of the T-DNA sequences in ag* and lfy* lines. These results were consistent with data obtained from McrBC-PCR and Bisulfite-PCR analyses for the 5 flanking region of T-DNAs (Supplementary Figs S6S8). Interestingly, the DNA methylation pattern at the T-DNA sequence in the GL2 locus, which never showed suppression of the phenotype, was largely unchanged after crossing (Supplementary Fig. S9). No large changes in DNA methylation were observed after crossing ag* with ibm2, or edm2 (Supplementary Figs S7,S8), consistent with previous data that ibm2 and edm2 affect processing of heterochromatic introns without changes in DNA methylation1820. DNA methylation is comparable between ag* and ag*met1 at the 5 ends of T-DNA sequences (Supplementary Fig. S7), while methylation, especially in CG context, was reduced in the 35S promoter sequence(s) of T-DNA in ag*met1 and ag*ddm1 (Supplementary Fig. S8). These data suggest that DNA methylation of the entire T-DNA sequence, including the 5 and 3 borders, might be required for T-DNA suppression.. . . Establishment of intronic T-DNA suppression requires RdDM factors. We further analysed how T-DNA suppression is epigenetically established. We found that hypermethylation of ag T-DNA in the 5 flanking sequence had occurred in the F1 generation (Supplementary Fig. S10). The 5 flanking sequence of lfy T-DNA was already methylated before suppression, but further methylated especially in non-CG contexts in the F1 generation after crossing with gl2 (Supplementary Fig. S10). The T-DNA inserted in GL2 was already highly methylated in the parental line, which remained largely unchanged in the F1 and F2 generations. These data suggest that crossing of two different T-DNA lines induces further DNA methylation in suppressed T-DNA sequences in the F1 generation. To test whether DNA methylation mediated by RdDM factors is required for establishment of T-DNA suppression, the ag and lfy T-DNA lines were crossed with the gl2 T-DNA line in the absence of RdDM factors in the F1 generation (Fig. 5A). To avoid effects of additional T-DNA sequences, point mutants of RdDM genes were used. When NRPE1, DRD1, and NRPD2a were mutated in the F1 generation, suppression of ag and lfy was not observed in the F2 generation (Fig. 5B,C), where plants with ag or lfy phenotypes segregated in an approximately 3:1 ratio (Table 2). The appearance of the ag phenotype is consistent with the absence of DNA methylation in the T-DNA sequence (Fig. 5D, Supplementary Fig. S11). This result is in clear contrast to double mutants of ag* and RdDM factors (Fig. 2A). In contrast, RDR6 was not required for the establishment of T-DNA suppression (Fig. 5D, Supplementary Fig. S11), suggesting that canonical RdDM factors are responsible for establishment of T-DNA suppression (Fig. 6).. . . . Discussion. In this study, T-DNA suppression was efficiently induced in a cross between ag or lfy and gl2 SALK T-DNA mutants, where F2 progeny were all WT phenotype, despite the presence of homozygous intronic T-DNA insertions in the AG and LFY genes. The production of suppressed T-DNA mutants was reproducible and the effect was stable for at least five generations, which allowed us to use this system to investigate how T-DNA suppression is established and maintained, by crossing mutants of genes involved in known epigenetic pathways.. Suppression of intronic T-DNA and loss of ag or lfy phenotypes from mutant plants suggested that in suppressed plants, introns with T-DNA are efficiently and stably spliced out (Figs 1 and 3). The intron harboring T-DNA in AG is about 12kb in length (Fig. 1A). Arabidopsis genes contain relatively short introns (~160bp in average) compared with genes in other plant species (~390bp in rice, ~510bp in maize)21, due to less abundant repeats in intronic regions202223. According to the Arabidopsis TAIR10 annotation, the putative longest intron in the genome is about 11kb, encoded in AT2G3410024. However, a previous report showed that at least 17kb intronic region in the OPR3 gene, containing a T-DNA insertion, can be transcribed and spliced out under biotic stress condition25. This suggests that plant PolII transcription and splicing machineries have the potential to transcribe and splice these irregularly long introns. We never observed suppression of the T-DNA insertion in the intron of the GL2 gene, which might be due to the generation of an exceptionally long intronic region (>20kb) that could exceed the capacities of Pol II transcription and/or splicing machineries (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. S3). However, PolII has the potential to transcribe much longer genes in the genomes of other organisms. For example, the human dystrophin gene is the longest known gene in the human genome that is 2.2Mb long with introns of over 100kb, which is transcribed by Pol II and co-transcriptionally spliced26. This suggests that in addition to the intron length, there may be other factors required for stable establishment of T-DNA suppression.. Introduction of ibm2, edm2, met1, and ddm1 mutations in suppressed ag* allowed to recover the ag mutant phenotype (Fig. 2). IBM2 and EDM2 are genes likely involved in 3 end processing of mRNA transcribed over the heterochromatic intron161720, suggesting that T-DNA suppression requires a heterochromatic region to splice out the T-DNA-containing intron. How IBM2 specifically recognizes heterochromatin in intronic regions is still not clear. On the other hand, EDM2 can bind to heterochromatin associated with T-DNA sequences via PhD domains27. MET1 and DDM1 are involved in DNA methylation and heterochromatin maintenance2829, and MET1 has previously been shown to be required for T-DNA suppression12. Loss of heterochromatin may prevent IBM2 and EDM2 interaction with intronic regions, ultimately losing the ability to produce a full-length pre-mRNA and splice out the T-DNA-containing introns for production of functional transcripts. This supports the strong relationship of DNA methylation and T-DNA suppression, and the involvement of heterochromatin and splicing machinery to regulate T-DNA-containing introns.. DNA methylation of splice sites has been reported to influence splicing in maize and bees3031. We observed an increase of DNA methylation in both 5 and 3 border regions, as well as inside T-DNA sequences in the suppressed lines (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs S69). Previous studies have shown that 35S promoters in T-DNAs cause trans-inactivation between homologous sequences6. In our study, 35S promoter region(s) of T-DNAs in AG and GL2 were already highly methylated before crossing (Figs 4, S8), suggesting that the homology of T-DNA sequences or the presence of hypermethylated 35S promoter sequences may be required, but not sufficient for the induction of intronic T-DNA suppression.. Transcript analysis of ag and ag* showed distinct expression patterns between mutants that exhibited the ag phenotype (ag, ag*ibm2 and ag*edm2) and ag* WT-like phenotype (Fig. 3). In general, the ratio of transcripts from upstream to those from downstream of the T-DNA is high in plants showing the ag phenotype, whereas the ratio is low in plants with WT-like flowers (Fig. 3A). Five different transcript isoforms of AG mRNA were identified in ag homozygous plants, and the ag mutant phenotype is associated with transcripts containing the 5 region of the T-DNA sequence. T-DNA insertion creates an alternative splice acceptor site and ectopic polyadenylation sites that terminate the transcript within the T-DNA, leading to accumulation of non-functional transcripts (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S5). Higher levels of WT transcripts in ag* and T-DNA suppression correlated well (Fig. 3), demonstrating that T-DNA suppression is a result of re-acquiring functional transcripts by splicing out T-DNA-containing introns. The level of WT AG transcripts from ag* is relatively low compared to controls, but may be sufficient for normal flower development, as shown by the lack of mutant phenotypes. Loss of IBM2 or EDM2 in ag* led to a significant loss of full-length AG transcripts, which explains the reappearance of the mutant phenotype.. The first interaction between the two T-DNA loci occurs when the parental genomes merge during fertilisation, and likely establishes T-DNA suppression in the F1 generation. Since ag and lfy heterozygous plants do not show suppression of the phenotypes after either crossing with WT or after self-pollination, the mechanism of T-DNA suppression is different from that of silencing unpaired sequences during meiosis32. Although AG, LFY, and GL2 genes are concomitantly expressed in the shoot apex33, whether T-DNA suppression requires co-transcription of T-DNA containing introns in the same tissue is not clear. T-DNA suppression in F2 progeny was not observed when NRPD2a, NRPE1, or DRD1 are mutated in F1 plants (Fig. 5, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S11). These genes are required for PolV-mediated de novo methylation and transcriptional gene silencing of TEs2. It has been reported that PolII-transcribed TE RNAs can enter the Pol II-RDR6-dependent RdDM pathway334. However, the RDR6 mutation did not inhibit T-DNA suppression in our system (Fig. 5, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S11). It is still possible that the Pol II-transcript from T-DNA-containing introns form a dsRNA hairpin structure (Supplementary Figs S1S3), resembling the dsRNA transgene system triggering RdDM in trans35, which could be directly processed by DCL3 into 24nt siRNAs36. Another scenario is that PolIV-dependent 24nt siRNAs may already be generated from hypermethylated regions of the T-DNA before crossing, which may act as a trans signal to induce RdDM on the homologous sequence. The differential epigenetic composition of each T-DNA sequence (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S9) may explain the inefficiency of suppression in self-pollination or allelic T-DNA crosses (Table 1), since in such cases, siRNAs required for induction of de novo methylation at unmethylated regions may not be available. In contrast, T-DNAs that can efficiently induce suppression in trans (e.g. the T-DNA in GL2 locus) may generate siRNAs corresponding to unmethylated regions in the other T-DNA sequence, which trigger de novo methylation to fill methylation gaps for induction of suppression (Fig. 6).. Epigenetic alterations between two homologous sequences in F1 hybrids after intra- and interspecific hybridization have been described in many plant species373839. In hybrid plants, DNA methylation and histone modifications on one chromosome can be transferred to other homologous regions, likely via siRNAs, which can sometimes induce heritable changes of gene expression and phenotypes404142. Paramutation is one such well-known phenomenon, where allelic transfer of epigenetic states occurs in hybrid plants43, and indeed paramutation-like effects have been observed between two T-DNA sequences in Arabidopsis F1 plants1244. In this study, we also observed a paramutagenic effect of lfy* allele, which can convert lfy to lfy* (Supplementary Fig. S4).. An intriguing observation in this study is the unidirectional induction of suppression. The T-DNA in GL2 can suppress T-DNAs in AG and LFY loci but not vice versa, and when ag and lfy were crossed, only the T-DNA in LFY was suppressed (Table 1). The direction of T-DNA suppression between the T-DNA mutants may arise from the differences in epigenetic states between the T-DNA inducing suppression and the T-DNA being suppressed. This may be further complicated by the structures of the T-DNA integrated in each locus. The T-DNA in LFY locus show relatively high DNA methylation in both 5 border of the T-DNA and the flanking intron sequence, even before suppression (Fig. 4), and often show spontaneous suppression (Table 1) that may explain why the LFY T-DNA suppression is facilitated by other T-DNAs. On the other hand, ag* and lfy* can induce suppression to their homologous, non-suppressed T-DNA alleles10 (Fig. S4), suggesting that the epigenetic state of suppressed T-DNAs (i.e. ag* and lfy*), such as DNA methylation and production of siRNAs, also causes distinct responses in non-suppressed T-DNAs. The T-DNA in the GL2 locus is never suppressed by the other T-DNAs tested (Table 1), perhaps because the T-DNA sequence is too long to be suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms, or because it forms structures too divergent from the original T-DNA structure, which is not complementary to the siRNAs produced from other T-DNA loci. Dominance/recessive relationships among T-DNA loci are analogous to the self-incompatibility system in Brassica species, where small RNAs produced from dominant S haplotypes epigenetically suppress recessive S haplotypes45.. Inactivation of unlinked homologous T-DNA sequences after hybridization resembles to RIP (Repeat-induced point mutation) and MIP (Methylation induced premeiotically) in fungi, which are important genome surveillance mechanisms to detect duplication of DNA sequences and transposition of TEs46. Indeed, a recent report demonstrated that de novo TE insertion in an intronic region is suppressed after sexual crossing, likely through interactions with endogenous TE copies in other loci47. The paramutation-like effect may also allow a quick suppression of intronic TEs within the population. The experimental system employed in this study, which reproduces stable trans-inactivation of homologous T-DNA sequences should be useful to decipher the molecular basis of diverse epigenetic phenomena, and should advance our understanding of agriculturally important traits, such as self-incompatibility, sex determination, and heterosis454849.. . .

PMC5338318	Primary growth in plant roots is governed largely by the root apical meristem (RAM), which harbors stem cells that continuously divide asymmetrically to generate new stem cells and daughter cells that undergo additional rounds of cell division123. The meristematic activity of the RAM is dynamically and precisely controlled through the integration of developmental and environmental signals4. Under optimal conditions, cell division in the meristematic zone remains active and roots grow normally and indeterminately. However, the activity of the RAM may be reduced by adverse environmental changes5, leading to a cell cycle arrest. Under conditions of severe stress, meristematic cells in the root completely lose their ability to divide, resulting in a permanent cell cycle arrest and determinate root growth67. Although some genes that regulate this cell cycle arrest and/or the activity of the RAM have been identified, the upstream signals and signaling cascades that cause the cell cycle arrest and reduced meristematic activity in the RAM in response to environmental stresses remain unclear.. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important regulators of meristematic activity in the RAM89. Compelling evidence indicates that controlled ROS levels and cellular redox homeostasis are essential for root growth. For example, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation in the root apex results in retarded root growth8, whereas the increased expression of antioxidant genes known to control H2O2 levels (e.g., glutathione [GSH]) is sufficient for RAM organization10. It has also been shown that the regulatory role of GSH in root growth is due to its redox buffering capacity1112. Genetic analyses of the genes encoding NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase A (NTRA), NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase B (NTRB), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase homolog 2 (CAD2), which mediate thioredoxin reduction and GSH synthesis, have confirmed the important role of cellular redox status in RAM activity13. Based on these studies and a functional analysis of NADPH oxidase, it was proposed that NADPH oxidase plays a crucial role in ROS generation and redox regulation of root growth13. ROS levels and cellular redox homeostasis appear to be controlled genetically and specific ROS levels may be required for the regulation of plant root development81213.. Despite the existence of a complex network controlling ROS production and scavenging in cells, environmental stress and genotoxic agents can induce excessive ROS accumulation leading to the oxidation of proteins, lipids, and DNA, and even cell death141516. DNA oxidation can cause DNA single- or double-strand breaks, resulting in genomic instability. DNA damage can trigger the DNA damage response (DDR) through ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)- or ATM and Rad 3-related (ATR)-mediated pathways depending on the presence of DSBs or single-strand breaks1718. ATM- and ATR-mediated signaling cascades are known to activate the G2 checkpoint kinase WEE1, which negatively regulates the G2-to-M phase transition, resulting in a cell cycle arrest and the induction of downstream effectors that enable cells to repair DNA damage before proceeding to mitosis19. In mammals, oxidative DNA damage and the DDR have been well characterized. Recently, the coupling of oxidative DNA damage and activation of the DDR with the activation of a G2/M cell cycle arrest was demonstrated using a mutant defective in two ROS-detoxifying enzymes, APX1 (cytosol) and CAT2 (peroxisome)20. In that study, it was demonstrated that the extra nuclear detoxification of ROS is essential to protect DNA from oxidative stress. However, the relationship between ROS and the DDR in plants, especially in the RAM, is unknown.. Mitochondria are a major source of ROS, and mitochondrial ROS (mROS) are essential for activation of the DDR in mammalian and yeast cells21222324. Although mitochondrial complexes I, II, and III have been shown to be direct sources of mROS in plants252627, several recent reports have identified complex I as the main source of mROS, which are associated with meristem activity and root growth82829. The genes responsible for complex I function include ABA Overly sensitive 6 (ABO6) and ABA Overly sensitive 8 (ABO8), which encode a DEXH-box RNA helicase and a P-type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain protein, respectively829. ABO6 regulates nad2 alternative splicing29, while ABO8 is responsible for the splicing of nad4 pre-mRNA8. Both nad2 and nad4 encode the subunit of mitochondrial NAD(P)H dehydrogenase and function in stability of mitochondrial complex I and ROS homeostasis, respectively830. Interestingly, both ABO6 and ABO8 affect ROS accumulation in the RAM, cell cycle progression, and root growth rates under normal conditions and in response to ABA, implying a key role for mROS in cell cycle progression and the meristematic activity of the RAM in plants. However, whether mROS induce the DDR in the RAM, and how mitochondria and the nucleus communicate with each other to prevent oxidative damage to DNA are unknown.. To elucidate the role of regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) family proteins in modulating root meristem activity, we performed a genetic screen using mutants defective in 24 RCC1 family genes30, Two mutants carrying mutations in RCC1/UVR8/GEF-Like 3 (RUG3) that showed delayed root growth were selected30. Given that RUG3 regulates nad2 pre-mRNA splicing and mitochondrial complex I biogenesis30, we were interested in the role of RUG3 in the regulation of mROS and the DDR during root cell cycle progression, and in its role in mitochondrial retrograde signaling in plants. Here, we show that the mutation of RUG3 caused delayed root growth and plant development. Intriguingly, we also found that RUG3 interacts directly with ATM to synergistically regulate nad2 pre-mRNA splicing, mROS accumulation, the DDR, and cell cycle progression. Our results indicate a novel role for ATM in modulating mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis, and they reveal a new mechanism leading to the activation of mitochondrial retrograde signaling in the ATM-mediated DDR and the maintenance of mitochondrial function in RAM homeostasis and activity.. . Results. . A loss of function in RUG3 results in short roots and delayed development. To identify novel genetic loci that regulate root growth, we performed a phenotypic analysis of loss-of-function mutants of 24 genes encoding RCC1 family proteins by sowing the seeds on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium for 8 days. The mutants with mutations in RUG3 (At5g60870) caused by T-DNA insertions (Supplementary Fig. S1) and undetectable levels of RUG3 mRNA showed severe root growth defects (Fig. 1ac). The mutants (SALK_092071 and N336814) we used in this study were previously designated as rug3-1 and rug3-2, respectively30.. A previous study showed that a loss of function in RUG3 caused retarded development in Arabidopsis including the root growth defects30; however, a detailed description of the influence of RUG3 mutations on root growth and development is lacking. To further investigate the role of RUG3 in plant root development, we conducted a systematic phenotypic analysis of rug3 mutants. As shown in Fig. 1ch, rug3-1 and rug3-2 mutant plants grew much more slowly than did wild-type (WT) roots after radical emergence, and the primary root length in both rug3 mutants was reduced by approximately 55% at 8 days after stratification (Fig. 1c,d). Notably, the size of the RAM in the mutant primary roots was markedly reduced, and the average cortical cell number in the RAM of the rug3 plants was dramatically decreased compared with that in wild type (Fig. 1e,f). Furthermore, the average length of mature root cells in the rug3 mutants was dramatically decreased compared with that in wild type (Fig. 1g,h). These results suggest that RUG3 modulates both RAM activity and root cell elongation in Arabidopsis.. In addition to root growth, both rug3 mutants showed delayed development. For example, the mutants exhibited late germination and cotyledon greening compared with WT plants (Supplementary Fig. S2ac). At the seedling stage, the rug3 plants were much smaller than wild type (Supplementary Fig. S2d), and the flowering time of the mutants was slightly delayed (Supplementary Fig. S2e; Supplementary Fig. S3a,b). As a result, the life span of the mutants was dramatically extended compared with that of wild type. Also, the stature of the rug3 mutants was comparable to that of wild type at the mature stage. Together, these data indicate that RUG3 also plays a pivotal role in vegetative growth and the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth.. Since these mutant alleles of RUG3 produced the same developmental defects, we assessed whether the mutant phenotypes were caused by a loss of function in RUG3. As expected, overexpression of RUG3 under the control of the CaMV35S promoter in a rug3-1 background completely restored all of the developmental phenotypes of the rug3-1 mutant (Supplementary Fig. S4ae), confirming the aforementioned role of RUG3 in plant development. Thereafter, we used rug3-1 to examine the function of RUG3 in root growth and plant development.. . . The rug3 mutant show increased cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint. To assess whether the short roots observed in rug3-1 plants were due to a defect in cell cycle regulation, we analyzed the expression of the marker gene of cell cycle in rug3-1 mutant plants. Our expression analysis show that the expression of KRP2, which is a main negative regulator of G1/S checkpoint31, was not changed (Supplementary Fig. S4), and the expression of CDKB1;1, which is specifically activated during early S phase and M phase32 was also not dramatically altered in rug3-1 mutant plants (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. S5). By contrast, the expression of CycB1;1, WEE1 and CDKB2;1, which activate the G2/M checkpoint19333435 are upregulated (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. S5). To confirm the result, we generated rug3-1 lines expressing WEE1pro::GUS and CycB1;1pro::GUS assays confirmed the upregulation of WEE1 and CycB1;1 transcription in the rug3-1 mutant background. GUS assays confirmed the upregulation of WEE1 transcription in the rug3-1 mutant background (Fig. 2b). The GUS assays also revealed CycB1;1pro::GUS expression in the meristematic tissues of germinating WT seedlings; in sharp contrast, CycB1;1pro::GUS expression was substantially increased in rug3-1 roots and shoots during early development (Fig. 2c,d). Taken together, these results indicate that RUG3 may function as a negative regulator of G2/M checkpoint activation.. . . The mutation of RUG3 exacerbates DNA damage. The G2/M checkpoint is also known as the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, ensures that cells repair damage to their DNA before entering mitosis1936. Based on the role of RUG3 in controlling the G2/M checkpoint, we speculated that RUG3 is involved in regulating the DDR in Arabidopsis. If this were the case, rug3-1 mutants should exhibit excessive DNA damage. To test this, we performed a comet assay to evaluate the DNA damage in 9-day-old seedlings grown under normal conditions. As expected, the percentage of DNA in the tail of rug3-1 cells was significantly higher than that in wild type (Fig. 3a,b), pointing to a role for RUG3 in the DDR at the G2/M checkpoint. Next, we examined the response of rug3 plants to the DSB-inducing agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; 0.01%) and found that rug3-1 was hypersensitive to MMS (Fig. 3c). Treated rug3-1 seedlings displayed greater root and shoot growth inhibition than did WT seedlings (Fig. 3c,d). These results suggest an important role for RUG3 in the DSB repair response. To further assess whether RUG3 mediates DNA replication, we analyzed the sensitivity of rug3-1 plants to a chemical inducer of DNA damage, the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). The result shows that the sensitivity of the rug3-1 plants to HU was comparable to that of the wild type (Supplementary Fig. S6), indicating that the RUG3 does not mediate the DNA replication stress in Arabidopsis.. Since the rug3-1 mutant show hypersensitive to DSB-inducing agent MMS, we assessed whether the mutant phenotypes were caused by a loss of function in RUG3. As expected, the transgenic line Re-4 can completely restored the greening rate phenotypes of the rug3-1 mutant and partial restoration the short root phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. S7), confirming the aforementioned role of RUG3 in DNA damage response.. . . RUG3 is ubiquitously expressed and may be repressed by MMS. Although it has been reported that RUG3 is a mitochondrial protein based on the bioinformatic prediction of an N-terminal transit peptide targeting the protein to mitochondria and the demonstrated subcellular localization of N-terminusRUG3-GFP in Arabidopsis protoplasts30, information about the expression pattern of RUG3 and the subcellular localization of RUG3 is lacking. To address this, we first analyzed the expression pattern of RUG3. Semi-quantitative PCR showed that RUG3 was expressed in multiple tissues, including the roots and rosette leaves of young seedlings and in the flowers and siliques of mature plants, with higher expression levels in the roots and rosette leaves of young seedlings (Fig. 4a). We next generated transgenic lines expressing RUG3pro::GUS for histochemical staining; our results confirmed the ubiquitous expression of RUG3. RUG3 was preferentially expressed in the vascular tissues of the various organs and tissues tested (Fig. 4be), the preferential expression in the vasculature fits to the fact that phloem cells contain most mitochondria37.. To check whether RUG3 is responsive to DNA damage and DNA replication stress, we analyzed the transcription level of RUG3 in response to MMS treatment. As shown in Fig. 4f, the mRNA level of RUG3 was markedly reduced by MMS. GUS staining confirmed that RUG3 transcription was repressed by MMS (Fig. 4g).. . . RUG3 is localized to mitochondria and interact with ATM. To further characterize the subcellular localization of full-length RUG3, we expressed RUG3-GFP under the control of the 35S promoter in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells. As shown in Fig 5a, RUG3-GFP was detected in mitochondria. The observed mitochondrial localization of RUG3 is consistent with previous data obtained using the N-terminus of RUG330, and it confirms the role of RUG3 in modulating mitochondrial function. RCC1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTP-binding protein Ran3839. Although we find RUG3 is localized to mitochondria, we still wondered whether RUG3 has the similar roles. As we expected, the results showed that, like UVR8 (UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8), RUG3 did not have detectable GEF activity (Supplementary Fig. S8).. ATM is a key upstream regulator of the DDR, and it was recently demonstrated to localize to and function in mitochondria in human cells4041. ATM is a large protein composed of 3845 amino acids; thus, it was difficult to express the full-length protein. Since ATM contains an N-terminal PWWP domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions42, we used the N-terminal region of ATM (300 amino acids; ATMn) in our experiments. To further characterize the subcellular localization of Arabidopsis ATM, we expressed the N-terminal sequence of ATM fused with GFP under the control of the 35S promoter in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells. Localization of ATMn-GFP in mitochondria was confirmed by Mitotracker staining (Supplementary Fig. S9).. Because RUG3 is colocalized with ATM in mitochondria and has a similar role in the DDR, we speculated that RUG3 and ATM regulate mitochondrial function and cellular responses to DNA damage via a direct or indirect interaction. To test this possibility, we performed protein-protein interaction assays. Intriguingly, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay showed that RUG3 interacted directly with ATMn in N. benthamiana leaf cells (Fig. 5b). This interaction was confirmed by a pull-down assay (Fig. 5c). Thus, RUG3 and ATM may work together to modulate mitochondrial function and the DDR.. . . ATM and RUG3 synergistically regulate the DNA damage stress response. ATM is a key upstream regulator of the DDR, and then we analyzed the genetic relationship between RUG3 and ATM in response to DNA DSBs in atm-2rug3-1 double mutant plants produced by a genetic cross. The sensitivity of rug3-1, atm-243, and atm-2rug3-1 double mutant plants to MMS stress was evaluated. When germinated on medium supplemented with 0.01% MMS, rug3-1 and atm-2 showed greater sensitivity than WT plants to MMS treatment (Fig. 6a,b; Supplementary Fig. S10). The percentage of germinating rug3-1 or atm-2 seedlings that turned green was markedly reduced by about 50% (Fig. 6b). By sharp contrast, MMS sensitivity was exacerbated in germinating atm-2rug3-1 double mutant plants, and the greening rate dropped sharply to only 12% (Fig. 6b). It is possible that RUG3 and ATM play a synergistic role in regulating the DDR.. . . ATM enhances the regulation of nad2 splicing by RUG3. It has been reported that RUG3 regulates nad2 pre-mRNA splicing30. Given that ATM and RUG3 synergistically regulate the DDR in plants, we speculated that ATM co-regulates the alternative splicing of nad2 pre-mRNA. If this is the case, atm-2 mutant plants should have abnormal nad2 splicing efficiency and atm-2rug3-1 mutant plants should exhibit even greater defects in nad2 splicing. To test this, we analyzed the level of nad2 mRNA containing intron 3 in rug3-1, atm-2, and atm-2rug3-1 double mutant plants following MMS (0.01%) treatment. As shown in Fig. 6c, the amount of nad2 mRNA containing intron 3 was significantly increased in rug3-1 mutant, consistent with previous data30. Unexpectedly, nad2 splicing in the atm-2 mutant was comparable to that in wild type. However, to our surprise, the retention of intron 3 in nad2 mRNA was elevated in the atm-2rug3-1 double mutant plants. To rule out the possibility that increased retention of intron 3 in nad2 mRNA is derived from an overall increase in mitochondrial transcripts of nad2, we performed RT-PCR to detect both the unspliced and spliced nad2 transcripts under MMS treatment and calculated the ratio of unspliced transcripts to spliced transcripts. As expected, the unspliced and spliced nad2 were increased and decreased in rug3-1 and atm-2rug3-1 double mutant plants, respectively (Fig. 6d). As a result, the ratio of unspliced transcript to spliced transcript in atm-2rug3-1 double mutant is significantly higher than rug3-1 (Fig. 6e). These data indicate that ATM and RUG3 synergistically regulate alternative splicing of nad2 pre-mRNA.. . . A loss of function in both RUG3 and ATM causes ROS overproduction. The gene nad2 encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is the main source of mROS. Since RUG3 and ATM synergistically regulate nad2 splicing and the DDR, we hypothesized that the increased DDR and cell cycle arrest in the RAM may be due to elevated ROS levels caused by abnormal nad2 splicing and complex I functionality. We therefore analyzed the role of RUG3 in modulating ROS levels and the ROS responses of plants. 3,3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining showed that 7-day-old rug3-1 mutant plants had substantially increased H2O2 levels in the RAM and cotyledons under normal conditions compared to wild type (Fig. 7a,b). The high level of ROS accumulation in rug3-1 was confirmed by dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining (Supplementary Fig. S11), suggesting a role for RUG3 in maintaining ROS homeostasis.. To assess whether the elevated ROS level in the rug3-1 mutant causes the DDR and cell cycle arrest in the RAM, we tested the effect of a scavenging agent on the ROS content in rug3-1 mutant plants. DAB staining clearly showed that the addition of GSH to the growth medium (MS medium) almost completely reversed the high level of ROS in the RAM and largely restored the RAM phenotypes of rug3-1 mutant plants (Fig. 7c,d). We also used the ROS production inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) to analyze that whether reduced ROS production in mitochondria would release the cell cycle arrest defect seen in rug3. Following treatment with DPI for 10h, the CycB1;1pro::GUS signal in rug3 was substantially reduced to the level in wild type (Fig. 7e). These data confirm that RUG3 modulates cell cycle progression in the RAM by maintaining ROS homeostasis.. Next, we tested whether RUG3 and ATM co-regulate mROS accumulation in response to MMS treatment. As shown in Fig. 7f and g, in the presence of MMS, atm-2 plants accumulated more H2O2 than did wild type. The level of H2O2 in the rug3-1 mutants was higher than that in wild type and increased significantly in response to MMS treatment. The level of H2O2 in the atm-2rug3-1 double mutant plants was similar to that in the rug3-1 mutant with or without MMS treatment. However, further phenotypic analysis showed that the two single mutants and double mutant exhibited different levels of sensitivity to H2O2 treatment compared with wild type (Supplementary Fig. S12); atm-2 showed the least sensitivity to H2O2, rug3-1 was in the middle, and the atm-2rug3-1 double mutant showed the greatest sensitivity to H2O2. Together, these results suggest that ATM does not affect ROS accumulation in plants under normal conditions, but that it modulates ROS accumulation and sensitivity by working together with RUG3 in the DDR.. . . . Discussion. The growth and development of plants, which are sessile organisms, occur mainly postembryonically and are affected by both developmental and environmental factors. One of the most important questions in plant biology is how meristematic activity and meristem tissue homeostasis are controlled in apical meristems, which determine shoot and root growth rates and the overall architecture of plants. In the RAM, how the meristematic activity of stem cells and their daughter cells is regulated is not precisely known. In particular, the mechanism by which RAM size and activity are modulated in response to the DNA damage caused by abiotic stress remains elusive. RUG3 was previously shown to regulate nad2 pre-mRNA splicing and complex I biogenesis30. In the present study, we found that RUG3 is an upstream regulator of ROS, which trigger retrograde signaling from mitochondria to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress and regulate both the DDR and cell cycle progression in the RAM. We also uncovered a novel mechanism by which ATM interacts with RUG3 in mitochondria to synergistically regulate the alternative splicing of nad2 pre-mRNA, mitochondrial function, oxidative metabolism, the DDR, and RAM activity.. In human cells, RCC1 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ran GTPase; it also has chromatin and DNA binding activity in the nucleus, enabling it to regulate gene expression383944. In plants, there are 24 genes encoding RCC1 family proteins; among them, UVR8 and TCF1 (Tolerant to Chilling and Freezing 1) have been well characterized and both proteins mediate plant response to environmental conditions4546474849. In cells irradiated with ultraviolet B (UVB) light, UVR8 moves from the cytosol to the nucleus, where it activates a signaling cascade that enables the cell to respond to the exposure46. When plants are exposed low temperature, TCF1 modulates lignin contents of the stressed cells and plant freezing tolerance through a chromatic-based regulatory network49. RUG3 encodes an RCC1 family protein that contains seven RCC1 tandem repeats and has strong similarity to UVR8. Unexpectedly, RUG3 contains mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS); both a partial protein containing the MTS30 and full-length RUG3 driven by the native promoter were shown to localize to mitochondria (Fig. 5a), suggesting a novel role for RUG3 in mitochondrial function. Indeed, it has previously been shown that RUG3 is specifically required for complex I biogenesis; it regulates the splicing of intron 3 from nad2 pre-mRNA molecules30. Our results also show that, like UVR8, RUG3 does not have detectable GEF activity (Supplementary Fig. S8). Since no DNA or RNA binding activity has been detected for RUG3, it is unclear how RUG3 mediates nad2 pre-mRNA splicing. It may be involved in nad2 pre-mRNA splicing through an interaction with ABO5, a PPR protein that can bind RNA and which is required for the splicing of intron 3 from nad2 pre-mRNA28, or through an interaction with other proteins (e.g., mitochondrial transcription termination factor 15 [mTERF15]) that specifically modulate intron 3 splicing from nad2 pre-mRNA50.. A previous study showed that a loss of function in RUG3 resulted in global changes in transcription, including the transcription of genes that function in mitochondria, protein metabolism, and cell organization30. However, how RUG3 regulates gene expression on a global scale is unknown. In this study, we produced several lines of evidence to support the hypothesis that RUG3 is an upstream regulator of mitochondrial retrograde signaling and that it controls cell cycle progression in the RAM by modulating ROS production and the DDR. First, we showed that RUG3 is a positive regulator of meristematic activity in the RAM, and that a loss of function in RUG3 resulted in short roots (Fig. 1ch). Second, we demonstrated that RUG3 is required for cell cycle progression, and that the mutation of RUG3 caused a cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2). Third, we demonstrated that the cell cycle arrest mediated by RUG3 was due to activation of the DDR. The mutation of RUG3 resulted in the increased expression of DDR markers (e.g., BRCA1 and RAD51) and downstream effectors (e.g., WEE1) that control the G2/M cell cycle arrest checkpoint (Supplementary Fig. S5; Supplementary Fig. S13). Finally, we showed that RUG3 plays an important role in ROS metabolism. Nonspecific and targeted scavenging of ROS restored the ROS levels and cell cycle progression in a loss-of-function RUG3 mutant. This is not surprising because mitochondrial complex I is the main site of ROS production82829. The overproduction of ROS can cause DNA oxidation and damage4051; however, mROS are a key mitochondrial signal that triggers mitochondrial retrograde signaling, which reprograms the expression of nuclear genes and maintains mitochondrial function (Chandel 2014). Notably, previous studies showed that RUG3 regulates the expression of several genes encoding proteins that are essential for mitochondrial function (e.g., TOM6, TIM13, and TIM22)30. These data suggest a critical role for RUG3 in the regulation of retrograde signaling from mitochondria to the nucleus and in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial functioning. In addition to transcriptional changes, ROS may cause the oxidation of proteins associated with many other biological processes. For example, oxidative stress induces the oxidation of ATM, which is able to activate ATM in the absence of DNA damage52.. In mammals, ATM not only activates the DDR and cell cycle arrest, it also modulates mROS levels and mitochondrial functioning4041. It has been shown that in mitochondria ATM phosphorylates BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID), which induces oxidative stress and a cell cycle arrest, as well as the quiescence/renewal of hematopoietic stem cells41. However, there are no reports on the mitochondrial localization or function of ATM in plants. In this study, we preliminary found that the ATM is able to interact physically with RUG3 in mitochondria (Fig. 5b,c). Intriguingly, ATM and RUG3 had a synergistic effect on nad2 pre-mRNA alternative splicing (Fig. 6ce) and subsequent ROS homeostasis (Fig. 7f,g) and the DDR (Fig. 6a,b). Our data suggest that RUG3 and ATM function as a rheostat to maintain ROS homeostasis by regulating nad2 pre-mRNA alternative splicing, which is required for proper mitochondrial organization and complex I activity. In this model, RUG3 promotes normal nad2 pre-mRNA alternative splicing to ensure normal mitochondrial architecture and basal ROS levels under normal conditions; in response to the DDR, the repression of RUG3 results in decreased splicing efficiency, mitochondrial complex I dysfunction, and increased ROS levels. ROS, as mitochondrial retrograde signals, enter the nucleus to activate the ATM-dependent DDR. ATM is also translocated to mitochondria where it attenuates the abnormal alternative splicing of nad2 pre-mRNA by complexing with RUG3, and in doing so it helps maintain mitochondrial function and ROS homeostasis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the role of ATM in mitochondrial nad2 pre-mRNA splicing. However, the mechanism underlying ATM-mediated nad2 pre-mRNA splicing remains unclear. Recently, it was demonstrated in human cells that ATM targets the core spliceosome in response to DNA damage to regulate genome-wide alternative splicing with a preferential role in intron retention during the DDR53. It will be of great interest to determine whether ATM specifically regulates nad2 pre-mRNA splicing or whether it regulates the alternative splicing of multiple mitochondrial pre-mRNAs in response to DNA damage. Defining the exact mechanism underlying the ATM- and RUG3-mediated maintenance of mitochondrial function and ROS homeostasis in response to DNA damage will further enhance our understanding of the DDR and the regulation of tissue homeostasis in the RAM.. . . Methods. . Plant materials and growth conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was used in this study. Seeds were surface-sterilized with 50% (v/v) commercial bleach for 5min, followed by five rinses with sterilized water, and then grown on MS medium (M519; PhytoTechnology Laboratories, Shawnee Mission, KS) containing 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% agar.

The inoculum was injected into the leaves of 4-week-old N. benthamiana plants. At 2 days after injection, GFP fluorescence was observed with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Jena, Germany) from the epidermal cells of leaves. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for colocalization analysis.. . . GEF activity assays. GEF activity assay was performed as described in54. Briefly, RCC1, RUG3, and human Ran were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusions with GST. The Ran clone was provided by Dr. Murray Stewart (Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Biology, Cambridge, U.K.).

PMC5335750	Background. . Verticillium dahliae Kleb. is a destructive phytopathogenic fungus that causes wilt diseases on more than 400 plant species, including cotton (Gossypium arboreum) [1, 2]. Verticillium dahliae infects cotton by penetrating the roots. It then spreads across the root cortex and invades the xylem vessels where it forms the conidia responsible for the colonization of vascular tissues and functional impairment. This results in several symptoms, including wilting, discoloration, necrosis, and defoliation [36]. Cotton fiber quality and annual yields decrease as a result of Verticillium wilt induced by V. dahliae, and a severe outbreak can lead to yield losses of more than 30% [7, 8]. In China, more than 40% of the cotton-growing area is threatened by Verticillium wilt, potentially causing considerable decreases in cotton production and serious economic losses each year. Furthermore, the fungus can survive for long periods in the soil even without a host, making Verticillium wilt difficult to control using practical and effective chemical treatments [9, 10]. Numerous methods are used to reduce the incidence of Verticillium wilt, such as the application of tillage, soil solarization, soil amendments, and biological controls. However, these are not always efficient or effective [11, 12]. Soil fumigation, which is by far the most effective treatment for inhibiting the propagation of Verticillium species, is costly and can have lethal effects on human health and the environment [7, 13]. The identification and isolation of disease-responsive candidate genes, along with the development of disease-resistant transgenic cotton cultivars, are essential for managing Verticillium wilt [1416].. The ribosomal protein (RP) has complex structures that differ in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The eukaryotic ribosome is composed of two unequal subunits (60S and 40S), four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and 82 different RPs. The small ribosomal subunit is composed of a single 18S rRNA and approximately 33 proteins, while the large subunit comprises 28S/25S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNAs, as well as approximately 49 proteins [1719]. The ribosome is a highly conserved protein that is essential for cellular activities. Although its main function is to synthesize proteins, recent in-depth studies have revealed that it is also important for cell growth, division, and development, and gene regulation [2022]. Recently, a study has shown that overexpression of the N-terminal 99 amino acids of ribosomal protein L3 confers resistance to pokeweed antiviral protein and the Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol in tobacco [23]. Another study has shown that ribosomal protein L12 and ribosomal protein L19 are important in nonhost disease resistance in N. benthamiana and A. thaliana. In addition, these genes also play a minor role in basal resistance against virulent pathogens [24]. In particular, a recent study examining ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14) and cancer concluded that this protein can specifically interact with murine double minute 2 (MDM2) to inhibit the degradation of p53 by MDM2 ubiquitin, thereby promoting p53 activity. In gastric and colorectal cancer cells the cell cycle is arrested and tumor cell growth is inhibited in the presence of abundant RPS14 [25]. Another study revealed that ribosomal protein L4 can also regulate the MDM2p53 loop to regulate p53 activity [26]. Although these studies suggest that RPs are important for disease resistance, they did not include cotton species. Therefore, a more thorough characterization of the function of the cotton RP may be useful for the breeding of Verticillium wilt-resistant cotton varieties.. Under natural conditions, plants frequently encounter diverse potential pathogens. Plants are constantly evolving to cope with these biotic stresses. For example, plants have evolved an immune system that includes constitutive and inducible defense systems that offer protection from potentially dangerous pathogens [27, 28]. Plants also produce several endogenous signaling molecules that help regulate plant defense responses, including jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene (ET), all of which are involved in complex signal transduction networks. These biochemical molecules function cooperatively or antagonistically to increase plant resistance to different pathogens [2932]. Our study revealed that cotton ribosomal protein L18 (GaRPL18) expression levels can be upregulated by accumulated SA, suggesting that RPs can mediate cotton resistance to Verticillium wilt through the SA signaling pathway. While SA is crucial for plant defenses and acquired systemic resistance, it is predominantly involved in the former [33, 34]. Increased SA levels in plant pathogen-challenged tissues and applications of exogenous SA induce the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, thereby enhancing resistance to invading pathogens [35, 36]. The activation of plant immune responses is also associated with increases in the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and nitric oxide (NO) levels [37]. While the signal transduction networks underlying all plant response mechanisms are complex, crosstalk between the different signaling molecules and networks provides plants with a powerful means of regulating immune responses [38, 39].. In this study, we focused on determining whether GaRPL18 is important for cotton resistance to Verticillium wilt caused by V. dahliae. Our objective was also to identify the signaling pathway associated with cotton defense responses. To verify the expression of GaRPL18, we harvested G. arboreum HuNanChangDeTieZiMian samples at different time points after treatments with V. dahliae, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), SA, or ET. We observed that the GaRPL18 expression level increased significantly following V. dahliae and SA treatments. Moreover, we used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology and transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines overexpressing GaRPL18 to functionally characterize GaRPL18 in cotton. Complementary physiology and molecular experiments confirmed that GaRPL18 significantly contributes to cotton resistance against the fungal wilt pathogen V. dahliae via a mechanism related to the SA signaling pathway. Our findings provide insights into the molecular features and functions of a cotton RP gene related to increased resistance to Verticillium wilt.. . . . Methods. . Plant sources and growth conditions. Seeds of G. arboreum HuNanChangDeTieZiMian (resistant) and NaShangQuXiaoHua (susceptible) were obtained from the Institute of Cotton Research of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The GaRPL18 overexpression vector (i.e., 35S::GaRPL18) was inserted into wild-type (WT) A. thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col-0) plant. The transgenic plants transformed with 35S::GaRPL18 were grown in a greenhouse at 22C and 60% relative humidity under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. The seeds from different G. arboreum cultivars were incubated in another greenhouse at 25C and 80% relative humidity under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod.. . . Culturing of Verticillium dahliae and inoculation of plants. An antagonistic defoliating Verticillium dahliae isolate (Vd07038) was grown on potato dextrose agar medium at 25C for 6days. Colonies were then cultured in Czapeks medium [3% (w/v) sucrose, 0.2% (w/v) NaNO3, 0.05% (w/v) MgSO47H2O, 0.05% (w/v) KCl, 0.002% (w/v) FeSO47H2O, and 0.131% (w/v) KH2PO4] for 57 days at 25C with shaking (150rpm). For V. dahliae treatments, 10ml conidial suspensions (107 conidia/ml in sterile distilled water) were applied to the bottom of pots containing seedlings. Similarly, A. thaliana plants were grown for 20days before a 10-ml conidial suspension was injected into the soil using a sterile needle. Control plants were inoculated with an equal volume of sterile distilled water. For in vitro treatments, seedlings were inoculated with V. dahliae, and the extent of stunting was determined using a previously described method [40]. Seedlings were inoculated with a 2-l conidial suspension (5103 conidia/ml) 2weeks after germinating.. . . cDNA cloning and construction of the GaRPL18 overexpression construct. Total RNA was extracted from V. dahliae-resistant G. arboreum HuNanChangDeTieZiMian plants using the RNAprep Pure Plant Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). The purified RNA was used as a template to prepare cDNA with the PrimeScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). The 450-bp full-length GaRPL18 coding sequence with XbaI and AscI linkers was cloned using the primers GaRPL18-F and GaRPL18-R (Table1). For overexpression studies, the 35S::GaRPL18 vector was constructed by digesting the GaRPL18 coding sequence with XbaI and AscI (BioLabs). The digested sequence was then inserted into a modified pCAMBIA3300 (Cambia) plant binary vector containing the glufosinate (Basta) resistance gene. This vector was used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using a freezethaw method.Table 1primers used in the researchPrimer nameForward and reverse primers(5-3)GaRPL18-FTCTAGAATGAAGCTTTGGGCCACCAAGaRPL18-RGGCGCGCCCATAAACAAGTTGGGTTTVGaRPL18-FACTAGTATGAAGCTTTGGGCCACCAAVGaRPL18-RGGCGCGCCCATAAACAAGTTGGGTTTQGaRPL18-FAATGAAGTCCGTGCCAAATCCAAGQGaRPL18-RCGGAGCCAAATGCCGTAGTTCTTTCGahistone3-FAAGACTGATTTGCGTTTCCAGahistone3-RGCGCAAAGGTTGGTGTCTTCAtUBQ10-FAACTTTGGTTTGTGTTTTGGAtUBQ10-RTCGACTTGTCATTAGAAAGAAAGAGATAAV-QPCR-FAACAACAGTCCGATGGATAATTCV-QPCR-RGTACCGGGCTCGAGATCGPAL-FTGGTGGCTGAGTTTAGGAAAPAL-RTGAGTGAGGCAATGTGTGA4CL-FATTCAAAAGGGAGATGCC4CL-RGAGAAGGGCAAAGCAACABasic chitinase-FCTTAGCCCAAACTTCCCABasic chitinase-RTACATTGAGTCCACCGAGAC. -1, 3-glucanase-FCACAGGTGCTGAAGTTGGT. -1, 3-glucanase-RCGATGGAGGGAAAGATGACadinene synthase-FTAACAACAATGATGCCGAGAACadinene synthase-RATGGTCCAAAGATGCTACTGCAtORA59-FTCATTTGACCAATCCTTCCTTTAtORA59-RCCGTTTCCRCACRCCTCTGTATAtPDFl.2-FACCCTTATCTTCGCTGCTCTTGAtPDFl.2-RATGTCCCACTTGGCTTCTCGAtVSP2-FCTTTCACTTCTCTTGCTCTTGGCAtVSP2-RGCAGTTGGCGTAGTTGATGGAAtNPRl-FGGCTTGCGGAGAAGACGACAtNPRl-RACGACGATGAGAGAGTTTACGGAtPRl-FGCTACGCAGAACAACTAAGAGGCAtPRl-RCCAGACAAGTCACCGCTACCAtPR3-FGAGACACCGCCACGAGGAAAtPR3-RTTGCTTGAAACAGTAGCCCCATAtAC02-FTGTTCCTCCTCTCAACCACTCAtAC02-RCCGACATCCTGTTTCCTTCTAtEIN3-FTCAAGGCTTTGTTTATGGGATTAAtEIN3-RGCAAGGTATGAGGAGTCGGTCAtERFl-FGAGAATGACCAATAAGAAGACGAAAtERFl-RCTCCCAAATCCTCAAAGACAAC. F Forward primer, R Reverse primer. . . . Bioinformatics analysis. We used the National Center for Biotechnology Information online BLAST tool to analyze the GaRPL18 sequence (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The Gene Structure Display Server 2.0 was then used to analyze gene structures. We also used the ExPASy online tool (http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/) to predict the isoelectric point and molecular weight. An image of the 3D structure was developed with the PyMOL program (http://www.pymol.org/).. . . Generation of the virus-induced gene silencing construct and pathogen inoculation. We used Cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCrV)-based vectors (i.e., pCLCrVA and pCLCrVB) for VIGS, with CLCrV:CHLI (encoding magnesium chelatase subunit I) as a positive control [41, 42]. The GaRPL18 fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using HuNanChangDeTieZiMian cDNA and the VGaRPL18-F/VGaRPL18-R primers (Table1). The PCR product was digested with SpeI and AscI (BioLabs) and inserted into the pCLCrVA vector. The constructs (i.e., pCLCrVA-GaRPL18, pCLCrVA, and pCLCrVB) were then used to transform A. tumefaciens strain GV3101. The cotyledons of 7-day-old Verticillium wilt-resistant cotton seedlings were then injected with equal amounts of CLCrV vectors. After a 24-h incubation in darkness, the cotton seedlings were transferred to the greenhouse and inoculated with V. dahliae,10days after the vector infiltration.. . . Arabidopsis thaliana transformation and molecular analysis. . Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 containing the GaRPL18 overexpression vector was used to transform Arabidopsis Col-0 via the floral dip method [43]. The T0 transgenic seeds were then spread evenly over soil in a pot. After 1week, seedlings were sprayed with 0.1% Basta to select positive transformants. The false-positive seedlings turned yellow before dying. Transgenic seeds of the T1 generation were selected on plates of Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.1% Basta. After a few days, lines with segregation ratios of approximately 3:1 (i.e., Basta resistant: Basta sensitive) were used to generate T2 lines. The transgenic seeds of the T2 generation were also selected on MS medium containing Basta to identify T3 homozygous lines. The T3 lines with the transgene and the correct segregation ratio were detected based on quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis of GaRPL18 expression. Only stable homozygous T4 lines exhibiting high GaRPL18 expression levels were chosen for further functional analyses.. . . Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We extracted total RNA from the roots and leaves of cotton plants as well as from the leaves of GaRPL18-overexpressing A. thaliana and WT plants using the RNAprep Pure Plant Kit. The RNA was used to prepare cDNA with the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time; Takara). The Gahistone3 (Cotton_A_11188) and ubiquitin10 (accession: At4g05320) genes were used as internal controls for cotton and A. thaliana, respectively. We designed all qRT-PCR primers with the Primer Premier 6.0 program (Table1). Diluted cDNA was used as the template for the qRT-PCR, which was conducted with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Tli RNaseH Plus; Takara) and an ABI 7900 qRT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The three-step method involved the following PCR conditions: 40cycles of 95C for 30s, 95C for 5s, and 60C for 30s. We analyzed the dissociation curves for each reaction and used the 2CT method [44] to calculate the expression level of each target gene. All reactions were conducted with at least three biological replicates.. . . Quantification of Verticillium dahliae colonization. We used a previously described qRT-PCR approach to detect and quantify V. dahliae colonization. The qRT-PCR analysis with the V-QPCR-F and V-QPCR-R primer pair (Table1) was completed as previously described [45].. . . Methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and ethylene treatments. Plants were treated with 1mM MeJA, SA, or ET solutions. Cotton or A. thaliana seedlings were grown in pots incubated in a greenhouse. They were sprayed with different solutions at the foliar stage. Control plants were treated with water at the same pH.. . . Measurements of free salicylic acid, nitric oxide, H2O2, and catalase levels. The abundance of the immune system-related molecules SA, NO, H2O2, and catalase (CAT) was monitored using different methods. The free SA content was determined via the Rigol L3000 high performance liquid chromatography system (Beijing, China) as previously described [46]. We ground leaf samples in liquid nitrogen for subsequent measurements of NO, H2O2, and CAT levels using a Quantitative Assay Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng, Beijing, China).. . . Cell death assay. Plant cell death was visualized with trypan blue staining as previously described with several modifications [47]. Leaves were soaked in trypan blue dye (1g phenol, 1mg trypan blue, 1ml lactic acid, and 1ml glycerol dissolved in 1ml sterile distilled water) and then stained by boiling. After cooling to room temperature, samples were decolorized with a chloral hydrate solution (2.5g/ml).. . . Verticillium dahliae recovery assay. To determine the effects of a V. dahliae infection on cotton and A. thaliana plants, we analyzed stem fragments from the first stem node. The cotton and A. thaliana stems were 4.5cm and 3cm long, respectively. The stems were cleaned according to a previously described method [48], and then sliced into six parts. The stem fragments were placed on potato dextrose agar in plates, which were incubated at 25C. Plant susceptibility to infection was defined according to the number of stem sections from which the fungus grew.. . . Analysis of the disease index, stunting, and chlorosis. For cotton plants, the disease index (DI) was calculated according to the following formula: DI=[(disease gradesnumber of infected plants)/(total checked plants4)]100%. Seedlings were classified into five grades (i.e., grade 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) according to the symptoms on the cotyledons and true leaves [49, 50]. The disease severity for A. thaliana plants was graded on a 05 scale, and the DI was calculated with the following formula as previously described [40]: DI=[(disease gradesnumber of infected plants)/(total checked plants5)]100%. The DI represents a comprehensive and objective measure of plant health, with high DI values corresponding to serious infections. The extent of stunting was rated on a 03 scale (0=no stunting; 1=moderate reduction in leaf area; 2=considerable decrease in leaf area; and 3=considerable decrease in leaf area, leaf number, and stem length). Leaf chlorosis was rated on a 04 scale (0=no symptoms; 1=up to 25% chlorotic leaves; 2=up to 50% chlorotic leaves; 3=up to 75% chlorotic leaves; and 4=up to 100% chlorotic leaves) [40].. . . . Results. . Analysis of GaRPL18 structure and expression patterns in cotton plants treated with Verticillium dahliae or hormones. Based on the results of an unpublished transcriptomics analysis of disease responses in G. arboreum plants, we analyzed GaRPL18 fragment sequences. HuNanChangDeTieZiMian and NaShangQuXiaoHua plants are resistant and susceptible to Verticillium wilt, respectively. We cloned the 1211-bp full-length GaRPL18 sequence using the GaRPL18-F and GaRPL18-R primers (Table1) along with HuNanChangDeTieZiMian cDNA. GaRPL18 was mapped to chromosome Ca3. It was localized to the complementary strand of the reference genome between positions 22987558bp and 22988768bp. The Gene Structure Display Server 2.0 program was used to analyze gene structures. Exons and introns are displayed as colored boxes and green lines, respectively (Fig.1a). GaRPL18 contains two introns as well as three exons that are 49, 64, and 450bp long (from right to left). The gene consists of a 450-bp opening reading frame encoding 149 amino acids (Fig.1a). GaRPL18 also contains a conserved ribosomal_L18ae domain sequence (indicated with a blue box in Fig.1a). The theoretical isoelectric point and molecular weight of the encoded protein were calculated as 10.46 and 17.9KDa, respectively, according to the ExPASy online tool. The 3D structure revealed that the ribosomal_L18ae domain (indicated in blue in Fig.1b) is largely composed of beta turns and alpha helices. Because the GaRPL18 function is unknown, especially in V. dahliae-infected cotton plants, we examined GaRPL18 expression patterns in samples harvested from Verticillium wilt-resistant and -susceptible cotton lines at different time points after inoculations. The GaRPL18 expression levels were stable over the duration of the experiment in the control plants treated with water (Fig.1c, d). In contrast, GaRPL18 expression levels fluctuated in the susceptible cotton plants. Additionally, in the Verticillium wilt-resistant cotton plants treated with V. dahliae, GaRPL18 expression was considerably upregulated at 6h after inoculation, and peaked after 12h, in both roots and leaves. To identify the signal pathway associated with GaRPL18, we examined the GaRPL18 expression patterns in hormone-treated HuNanChangDeTieZiMian plants. We observed that GaRPL18 expression was differentially affected by the plant hormones. GaRPL18 expression was rapidly induced, reaching a peak level at 6h after treatment, following the application of exogenous SA, but remained at baseline levels following MeJA or ET treatments (Fig.1e). These results suggest that GaRPL18 enhances the resistance of cotton to V. dahliae, and affects the SA-mediated signaling pathway.Fig. 1Structural analysis and expression patterns of GaRPL18 under Verticillium dahliae stress or hormone treatment in cotton. a Gene structure analysis. b Protein 3D structure. c,d After seeding for 3 weeks, the cotton seedlings of HuNanChangDeTieZiMian (resistant, Ga01) and NaShangQuXiaoHua (susceptible, Ga02) were inoculated with V. dahliae spores or an equal sterile distilled water (Mock control). The sample of cis the leaf, while dis root. e The leaves of resistant cotton (HuNanChangDeTieZiMian) were treated by exogenous hormones or an equal sterile distilled water. The Mock and treated roots and leaves were harvested at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi, and expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR using Gahiston3 as the internal reference gene. Expression levels of Mock control was normalized to 1, error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences, as determined by Students t-test (*P<0.05; **P<0.001). . . . Interactions between GaRPL18 and PR genes. To further clarify the effects of GaRPL18 on Verticillium wilt resistance in cotton plants, we monitored the expression levels of PR genes at different time points after wilt-resistant cotton plants were inoculated with V. dahliae. Phenylpropanoid metabolism is critical for cotton defense responses, and involves the core genes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL; Cotton_A_00465) and 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL; Cotton_A_02864) [51]. In leaf tissue, the expression levels of the GaRPL18-related PAL and 4CL genes were highest at 12h, while the expression of 4CL in the roots peaked after 48h. Additionally, PAL expression levels continued to increase in inoculated plants. The basic chitinase (Cotton_A_36866) and -1, 3-glucanase (Cotton_A_36866) genes are important for plant disease resistance because the encoded enzymes can decompose the cell walls of pathogens, thereby protecting plants from disease [27]. In leaves, the expression levels of GaRPL18-related basic chitinase and -1,3-glucanase genes peaked after 48h. In contrast, the highest basic chitinase and -1,3-glucanase expression levels in the roots were observed after 6h and 24h, respectively. Cadinene synthase (Cotton_A_34493) is a key gene involved in synthesizing terpenoids, which are critical phytoalexins in cotton [52]. The cadinene synthase expression level rapidly increased in the leaves and roots of inoculated plants, peaking after 48h (Fig.2).Fig. 2Interactions between GaRPL18 and other pathogenesis related (PR) genes. Time course in the transcription of resistant cotton defense-related pathogenesis related (PR) genes from different time points after inoculation. Total RNAs were extracted from 3-week-old cotton plants after treatment with V. dahliae, and infected roots and leaves were harvested at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. The expression levels of PR gene were determined by qRT-PCR using Gahiston3 as the internal reference gene. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences, as determined by Students t-test (*P<0.05; **P<0.001). The left part is the result of root (gray), the right part is the result of leaf (white). . . . Silencing of GaRPL18 in cotton considerably weakened resistance to Verticillium dahliae. To clarify the function of GaRPL18 in cotton responses against V. dahliae, we used CLCrV-based VIGS to generate GaRPL18-knockdown plants. Two weeks after HuNanChangDeTieZiMian plants underwent an Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration, we used qRT-PCR to assess the gene silencing efficiency. The abundance of GaRPL18 transcripts was significantly lower in CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants than in the controls (Fig.3c), indicating that GaRPL18 was effectively silenced in these plants. Additionally, following V. dahliae inoculations, there were no obvious disease symptoms on the tissues of the vector control plants, while necrotic, yellowish, stunted, and wilting leaves were observed on CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants (Fig.3a). Using a recovery assay, we examined the extent of the V. dahliae colonization in the infected stems of treated plants. This analysis was used to determine the virulence of the fungus for each plant. There were more fungal colonies in CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants than in CLCrV control plants (Fig.3b). We used DI values to confirm that the resistance of cotton plants to V. dahliae was compromised in the absence of GaRPL18 expression. The DI values were significantly higher for CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants than for the control plants at 20 and 25days post-inoculation (dpi) (Fig.3d).Fig. 3Ribosomal protein GaRPL18 is involved in the resistance of cotton to V. dahliae. a Disease symptoms induced with V. dahliae strain on the leaves of empty-vector control plants and CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants at 25 dpi. b 25-dpi stem sections were plated on PDA medium, incubating at 25C. Photos were taken at 7day after plating. c Transcript levels of GaRPL18 in leaves of empty-vector control plants and CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants, which were determined by qRT-PCR using Gahiston3 as the internal reference gene. Value of CLCrV was normalized to 1. d Assessment of Disease Index (DI) at 20 dpi and 25 dpi. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates (n30). e The levels of Verticillium dahliae biomass by qRT-PCR on the leaves of empty-vector control plants and CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants at 20 dpi and 25 dpi. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences, as determined by Students t-test (*P<0.05; **P<0.001). f The infected CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants showed vascular browning in xylem at 25 dpi. . Using qRT-PCR, we quantified V. dahliae colonization levels. The expression levels of V. dahliae genes indicated that CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants were significantly more sensitive to V. dahliae than the controls (Fig.3e). Moreover, we observed that the xylem of CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants exhibited greater vascular browning than the controls (Fig.3f). An additional examination of cotton cell morphology in inoculated plants revealed that the vascular bundle cells of CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants were longer and larger than those of control plants (Fig.4a). This was likely because V. dahliae mycelia may have more easily penetrated CLCrV:GaRPL18 plant than the control. To visually contrast the differences in the leaves of plants inoculated with V. dahliae, we used trypan blue to stain dead cells. The trypan blue staining area was larger and the color was more intense in the CLCrV:GaRPL18 leaves, particularly in the veins, than in the control leaves (Fig.4b).Fig. 4Effect of silencing of GaRPL18 in cotton under V. dahliae stress. a The observation of cell morphology of the stems of CLCrV and CLCrV:GaRPL18 cotton plants at 25 dpi. b Trypanblue staining was used to visualize cell death of the leaves of CLCrV and CLCrV:GaRPL18 cotton plants at 25 dpi. c Measuring the SA content of CLCrV and CLCrV:GaRPL18 cotton plants at 25 dpi via HPLC. Bars represent standard error from three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences (Students t-test; *P<0.05). d Leaves of CLCrV and CLCrV:GaRPL18 cotton plants were harvested at 12 hpi and 24 hpi to measure the contents of NO, H2O2 and CAT. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences when compared with control (Students t-test; *P<0.05; **P<0.001). . . . Salicylic acid, nitric oxide, H2O2, and catalase levels decreased in GaRPL18-silenced cotton plants upon Verticillium dahliae infection. To further evaluate the role of GaRPL18 and its relationship with the SA pathway in cotton defense responses to V. dahliae infection, we analyzed the SA content and the abundance of several other immune-responsive compounds (i.e., NO, H2O2, and CAT) in V. dahliae-treated plants. All compounds were present in lower amounts in inoculated CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants than in CLCrV control plants (Fig.4c, d). These results indicate that silencing GaRPL18 in wilt-resistant cotton plants inhibits V. dahliae-induced production of SA, NO, H2O2, and CAT, further confirming that GaRPL18 is closely related to the SA signaling pathway.. . . Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seeds overexpressing GaRPL18 increased in size and weight, while seedlings became more resistant to Verticillium dahliae. . Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was transformed to generate transgenic lines overexpressing GaRPL18 under the control of the 35S promoter. We then used a variety of methods to select homozygous GaRPL18-overexpressing transgenic lines, including a 0.1% Basta treatment, PCR, and qRT-PCR (Additional file 1: Figure S1ae). We observed that the seeds of stable GaRPL18-overexpressing T4 plants were larger than those of WT plants (Additional file 1: Figure S1f). Analyses of seed weight per 1,000 mature dried seeds, seed length, seed width, and the length: width ratio revealed that the values were higher in GaRPL18-overexpressing transgenic plants than in WT controls, although this difference was not significant for the length: width ratio (Additional file 1: Figure S1gi). We then used an in vitro technique to assess the resistance of A. thaliana seedlings to V. dahliae. The GaRPL18-overexpressing transgenic plants were compared with the WT plants daily. As expected, the transgenic A. thaliana plants were more resistant to Verticillium wilt than the WT plants. All WT plants were dead within 14days of being inoculated with V. dahliae, while the transgenic plants were still alive (Fig.5a). In WT plants, wilting was observed as early as 5 dpi, and the plants rapidly became yellow and exhibited stunted growth. At 14 dpi, the WT leaves were observed to be more stunted (grade 3) than the transgenic leaves (grade 2). Additionally, chlorosis was more severe in WT plants (grade 4) than in transgenic plants (grade 2) (Fig.5b, c). This further confirms that the transgenic A. thaliana plants overexpressing GaRPL18 were more resistant to Verticillium wilt than the WT plants.Fig. 5Effects of overexpression of GaGRPL18 in A. thaliana seedings and the effects of signaling pathway-related marker genes under V. dahliae stress. a Disease symptoms of in vitro grown seedings. 2-week-old plantlets were treatment with V. dahliae.

WT : wild-type. d Expression patterns of JA, SA and ET signaling pathway-related marker genes in WT and GaRPL18 transgenic A. thaliana under water or V. dahliae challenge for 24h. The expression levels was monitored by qRT-PCR using AtUBQ10 as an internal control gene. Expression levels of untreated control was normalized to 1. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences, as determined by Students t-test (*P<0.05; **P<0.001). WT: wild-type. . . . Effects of GaRPL18 overexpression on the salicylic acid signaling pathway in Verticillium dahliae-treated transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We examined the expression level of signaling pathway-related genes, including those involved in JA biosynthesis [i.e., octadecanoid-responsive Arabidopsis AP2/ERF domain protein 59 (AtORA59), plant defensin 1.2 (AtPDF1.2), and vegetative storage protein 2 (AtVSP2)], SA biosynthesis [i.e., non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (AtNPR1), pathogenesis-related gene 1 (AtPR1), and pathogenesis-related gene 3 (AtPR3)], and ET biosynthesis [i.e., amino cyclopropane carboxylate oxidase 2 (AtACO2), ethylene insensitive 3 (AtEIN3), and ethylene response factor 1 (AtERF1)]. As shown in Fig.5D, over-expression of GaRPL18 in the Col-0 background did not affect expression of genes related to the JA, SA and ET pathways; these marker genes had similar expression levels in WT and over-expression plants without V. dahliae stress. In addition, the expression levels of the JA- and ET-related marker genes were similar overall between the WT controls and GaRPL18- overexpressing transgenic A. thaliana plants at 24h post-inoculation (hpi). However, the SA-related genes were expressed more highly in the rosette leaves of transgenic plants than in the WT leaves at 24h post-inoculation. The expression levels in the WT leaves were unchanged (Fig.5d). Thus, GaRPL18 overexpression had little effect on the signal transduction pathways regulating JA and ET biosynthesis, but had a significant effect on the SA biosynthesis signal transduction pathway.. . . Application of exogenous salicylic acid increases the resistance of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants to Verticillium dahliae. We examined the resistance of GaRPL18-overexpressing transgenic A. thaliana plants to V. dahliae infection. When T4 lines were inoculated with V. dahliae, the transgenic plants were noticeably more resistant to the fungus than the WT plants. We then pretreated the rosette leaves of WT and transgenic A. thaliana seedlings with 1mM SA for 24h. The leaves were then inoculated with V. dahliae and treated daily with supplemental exogenous SA for 4days. The transgenic A. thaliana plants were considerably more resistant to V. dahliae than the WT plants following the SA treatments (Fig.6a). Additionally, we used the recovery assay to examine the colonization of infected WT and transgenic stems by V. dahliae. The number of colonies differed significantly between the WT, transgenic, and SA-treated transgenic plants. Overall, the transgenic plants grew better than the WT plants, with the SA-treated transgenic plants exhibiting the greatest resistance to V. dahliae. There were no differences between the WT and SA-treated WT plants (Fig.6b). This is further evidence of the relationship between GaRPL18 and SA. To more clearly observe the effects of V. dahliae on rosette leaves, we removed the rosette leaves from plants at 15 dpi. Consistent with our previous results, the SA treatment enhanced the resistance of transgenic A. thaliana rosette leaves to V. dahliae, but had little effect on WT leaves (Fig.6c).Fig. 6Effects of -overexpression of GaRPL18 and exogenous SA in defense response to V. dahliae in A. thaliana.. a Disease symptoms induced with V. dahliae strain on the rosette leaves of WT, GaRPL18 overexpressed plants and exogenous SA-treated plants. 3-week-old seedings were inoculated with V. dahliae, and pretreated transgenic A. thaliana and wild-type seedlings rosette leaves with 1mM SA for 24h before inoculation with V. dahliae. Then, supplementing exogenous SA every day until four days. The control plants were sprayed with water. Photos were taken at 15 dpi. b 15-dpi stem sections were plated on PDA medium, incubating at 25C. Photographed at 7day after plating. c The observation of A. thaliana rosette leaves. d Assessment of Disease Index (DI) at 10 dpi and 15 dpi.

Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences, as determined by Students t-test (*P<0.05; **P<0.001). f Trypan blue staining was used to visualize cell death of the leaves of A. thaliana at 15 dpi. . We calculated the DI values and quantified the V. dahliae colonization using qRT-PCR for WT plants, SA-treated WT plants, transgenic plants, and SA-treated transgenic plants. The DI value for WT plants was significantly higher than that of transgenic plants, including those treated with SA (Fig.6d). Analyses of the expression level of fungal genes revealed that SA-treated transgenic plants were the most disease-resistant, while WT plants were the most susceptible (Fig.6e). The trypan blue staining results were similar for WT and SA-treated WT plants. We observed dark blue veins and large stained mesophyll areas. The veins of transgenic leaves were light blue, and the mesophyll was not extensively stained. These observations are consistent with the greater disease resistance of SA-treated transgenic plants (Fig.6f).. . . . Discussion. . Verticillium wilt is one of the most lethal fungal diseases of plants and significantly reduces the quality and annual yields of cotton. Therefore, clarifying the molecular mechanism underlying cotton resistance to V. dahliae is essential for developing new wilt-resistant cotton varieties. Previous studies involving V. dahliae infections revealed that this pathogen attacks susceptible plants by germinating on the roots. It then employs various mechanisms to move through the root cortex into the plant vascular system, allowing for further colonization of the plant. When the fungus has completely infected the plant, it produces microsclerotial spores that remain stable and dormant in the soil until they are exposed to a new host [53]. To breed new cotton varieties resistant to Verticillium wilt, more research is required to identify resistance-related genes. Technological improvements have facilitated the mining and functional analysis of genes. There are some reports that describe the application of genes encoding proteins associated with resistance to V. dahliae to develop transgenic A. thaliana plants capable of inhibiting disease development. These genes include those encoding glutathione S-transferase [54, 55], rate-limiting enzymes [56], and transcriptional regulators [57]. However, efforts involving gene mining have been insufficient, and the cotton-producing regions of China are still affected by annual outbreaks of Verticillium wilt. The lack of known wilt-resistance genes in cotton makes the identification and functional characterization of V. dahliae resistance-related genes essential for the development of new wilt-resistant cotton varieties. In this study, we confirmed that GaRPL18, which encodes an RP, influences resistance to Verticillium wilt.. The function and characteristics of RPs during protein synthesis have been thoroughly researched, and recent in-depth studies confirmed that RPs also have important roles in other processes [2022]. In particular, some studies have shown PRs play an important role in plant disease resistance [23, 24]. Recent cancer studies concluded that the RPs can regulate the expression of key genes in the MDM2p53 regulatory loop, thereby promoting p53 activity and suppressing tumor growth [25, 26, 5860]. Additionally, the RP has other effects related to disease resistance. For example, mutations to RPS19 are associated with a congenital erythroblastopenia with a decreased abundance or lack of erythroid precursors [61]. However, little is known about the function and characteristics of RP-encoding genes during cotton resistance to V. dahliae. In this study, we determined that the RP mediates the resistance of cotton plants to V. dahliae.. To confirm the role of GaRPL18 in cotton pathogen defense responses, we cloned the gene using cDNA produced from RNA extracted from wilt-resistant cotton plants. We also analyzed the GaRPL18 expression patterns in different cotton varieties treated with V. dahliae. The GaRPL18 expression level was rapidly and considerably upregulated in infected wilt-resistant cotton plants, but was relatively unchanged in the wilt-susceptible cotton plants. We then examined the expression of PR genes in wilt-resistant cotton plants. We confirmed that cotton resistance to V. dahliae results from interactions among various disease resistance systems that function together to resist pathogen invasions. Using VIGS technology, we determined that the silencing of GaRPL18 in wilt-resistant cotton plants significantly decreased resistance to V. dahliae. Additionally, the NO, H2O2, and CAT contents were lower in cotton plants in which GaRPL18 was silenced than in vector-control plants. An invasion by V. dahliae induces a spike in NO content, which is important for disease resistance in plants [62]. An earlier study concluded that the H2O2 content is significantly higher in disease-resistant tomato plants than in control plants, and that CAT plays an important role in early defense responses [63]. Our results indicate that NO, H2O2, and CAT affect the GaRPL18- related responses to V. dahliae in cotton plants. These observations confirm that GaRPL18 is important for cotton resistance to V. dahliae, which is consistent with the anti-carcinogenic effects reported for other RPs. We used transgenic A. thaliana plants to further analyze V. dahliae disease resistance traits based on DI values, V. dahliae colonization, trypan blue staining, and recovery assays. Moreover, while the rosette leaves of WT plants gradually exhibited disease symptoms with increasing fungal growth and spread, almost no disease symptoms were observed on the rosette leaves of GaRPL18-overexpressing transgenic plants. This implies that the fungus was inhibited in the roots of the transgenic plants, and prevented from spreading into the rosette leaves. Additionally, in vitro analyses of the wilt-resistance of GaRPL18-overexpressing A. thaliana plants further confirmed the role of GaRPL18 in plant defense responses to V. dahliae. This suggests that the accumulation of GaRPL18 considerably impedes pathogen colonization, even at the seedling stage. In summary, we confirmed that GaRPL18-overexpressing transgenic plants were more resistant to V. dahliae than WT plants, and that the extent of V. dahliae colonization was significantly lower in transgenic plants than in WT plants.. We also observed that GaRPL18 expression was rapidly upregulated by SA, reaching peak levels 6h after the application of the hormone. In contrast, MeJA and ET treatments had minimal effects on GaRPL18 expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that GaRPL18 may be associated with the SA signaling pathway. This was verified by a significant decrease in SA levels in V. dahliae-infected CLCrV:GaRPL18 plants. The activation of SA signaling in stressed plants can stimulate the expression of downstream disease-resistance genes to provide protection from pathogens [64, 65]. There are many genes related to the SA signaling pathway, including NPR1, PR1, PR3, WRKYs, and AtGSTF6 [6669]. To verify these results, the JA-, SA- and ET-related marker gene expression levels were examined in V. dahliae-infected transgenic A. thaliana plants overexpressing GaRPL18. The upregulated expression of SA signaling pathway-related genes (i.e., AtNPR1, AtPR1, and AtPR3) and SA content confirmed our hypothesis. To further clarify the link between GaRPL18 and SA signaling, we treated the transgenic and WT plants with exogenous SA, and observed that the hormone significantly increased the resistance of transgenic plants to V. dahliae. These findings imply that GaRPL18, working in concert with the SA signaling pathway, has a strongly antimicrobial effect on V. dahliae. Therefore, GaRPL18 may be useful for breeding Verticillium wilt-resistant cotton varieties.. . . Conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the RP function related to cotton resistance to V. dahliae. We used VIGS technology to confirm that GaRPL18 is important for the resistance of cotton plants to V. dahliae infections. Our data also suggest that breeding new cultivars that overexpress GaRPL18 may be an effective way to control Verticillium wilt of cotton plants. Finally, this study revealed that SA is an important factor related to the cotton defense response system, and that the mechanism of GaRPL18-associated V. dahliae resistance is related to the SA signaling pathway..
PMC5374466	Malaria is caused by protozoan endoparasites that belong to the genus Plasmodium and the phylum Apicomplexa with transmission between human hosts performed by female Anopheles mosquitoes. Interestingly, these protozoan parasites have much in common with plants1. The most obvious plant connection is that most apicomplexan parasites harbour a plastid similar to the chloroplast of plants and algae, known as the apicoplast. The origin of the apicoplast in Plasmodium and other apicomplexans is thought to be from secondary endosymbiosis whereby a heterotrophic eukaryote engulfed a red algal ancestor, the latter being retained as a plastid2345. The apicoplast is non-photosynthetic, but critical for the survival of Plasmodium as it is involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, iron-sulphur clusters and haem, that are essential for the liver and mosquito stages of the parasite life cycle4567. The production of isoprenoid precursors by the apicoplast is essential for the human blood stage89. In addition to this prominent chloroplast relic, many genes thought to have originated from the red algal ancestor have also transferred into the nuclear genome of apicomplexan parasites in a similar manner to chloroplast-encoded genes in plants10. Of note is that comparison of the P. falciparum genome with other annotated eukaryotic genomes revealed greater similarity of P. falciparum to the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana than any other non-apicomplexan taxa1.. A. thaliana was the first plant to have its genome sequenced11 and has become one of the most heavily studied model organisms in genetics and molecular biology. It is genetically tractable, has a small genome (135 MB, 5 chromosomes), a short life cycle and is easy to grow. A wealth of natural variants and gene knock-out lines are available as well as classical point mutants induced by mutagens such as ethyl methanesulfonate12.. The evolutionary relationship between apicomplexans and plants is not only apparent at the organelle level, but also from the activity of herbicides against Plasmodium. Indeed, pharmaceutical and agrochemical leads often show similarities in structure and activity13. Delaney et al.14 showed that the 20 most frequently used side chain groups in pharmaceutical drugs are found with similar frequency in herbicides. Coupled with this is that the target sites or biological processes that human drugs and agrochemicals interact with are sometimes shared. As such, compounds toxic to plants might similarly affect other organisms like Plasmodium species with examples available for commercial herbicides13. The widely used commercial herbicide glyphosate inhibits the P. falciparum asexual blood-stage in vitro, suggesting a shikimate pathway is shared with plants15. The commercial herbicide endothall inhibited growth of a chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum strain with an IC50 of 8M16. Dinitroaniline-type herbicides also have activity against protozoal parasites including Plasmodium species171819. In a larger study, the activity of 680 commercial agrochemicals including insecticides, fungicides and herbicides were systematically tested in vitro and in vivo on Plasmodium species, Leishmania species and trypanosomal parasites. Some of the compounds were highly active against protozoan pathogens and have potential as drug leads20.. Along with commercial herbicides, relationships between herbicidal and antimalarial compounds at the pre-development stage have also been reported in the literature. Witschel et al.21 investigated inhibitors of plant serine hydroxymethyltransferase, a key enzyme in the folate cycle, and showed many had significant activity against both P. falciparum and P. vivax enzymes. The antibiotic fosmidomycin which targets 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase has been shown to be antimalarial22. Finally, the aryl bis-sulfonamides which are inhibitors of 2-methylerythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase, were found to inhibit both A. thaliana and P. falciparum enzymes in vitro23.. Despite there being considerable interest in using herbicides as antimalarial compounds, applications in the reverse direction are lacking. Thus we explored this rationale, namely whether compounds specifically designed to kill Plasmodium and other apicomplexans are also active against plants. We found many antimalarial drugs to be herbicidal, which offers two new avenues for future research; the first and most obvious is to use the significant knowledge of antimalarial drugs to consider new chemistries or modes-of-action for herbicides. The second and more radical possibility is to use the genetically tractable A. thaliana to explore what could be shared modes-of-action for understudied antimalarial drugs.. . Results. . The effect of herbicides on A. thaliana growth. To test the effect of compounds, sterile A. thaliana seeds were sown on media containing sugar, salts and vitamins, and supplemented with a compound of interest. After two weeks, the extent of growth inhibition for each compound was assessed by analysing images with ImageJ (Fig. 1). Most of the herbicides chosen (Table 1) inhibited A. thaliana germination and growth at 20g/mL (Fig. 2). Asulam inhibited growth after radicle emergence, whereas atrazine, glufosinate and glyphosate halted growth after expansion of what were chlorotic cotyledons. Atrazine was the only herbicide tested that displayed apparent instability, being less effective after one week of light (Supplementary Fig. 1). The concentration 20g/mL was sub-lethal for oryzalin and dicamba which across conditions inhibited growth by 76% and 64% respectively with arrested growth at the cotyledon stage. Trifluralin was less effective at 20g/mL, inhibiting growth by 50%. This is probably due to the well-known instability under sunlight and volatility of dinitroanilines2425. Clethodim is a monocot-specific herbicide and inhibited A. thaliana (dicot) growth only by 330% and allowed true leaves to emerge (Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall these control compounds highlight that even successful market herbicides range in efficacy against A. thaliana and similarly, an antimalarial drug might not affect A. thaliana, but could remain highly effective against other, non-tested plant species.. . . Antimalarial compounds with herbicidal activity. Of the twenty antimalarial compounds tested, (Table 1) eleven were active against A. thaliana at 20g/mL (Fig. 2). The artemisinin-based drugs artesunate and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) showed 98% growth inhibition and induced chlorosis in the cotyledons. Ciprofloxacin, clindamycin and methacycline allowed germination and full expansion of cotyledons that were completely white. Methacycline efficacy was reduced by light pre-treatment, but not dark pre-treatment, suggesting light sensitivity. Doxycycline, a tetracycline like methacycline, also induced chlorosis, but the plants yellowed rather than fully bleaching. Doxycycline showed some light sensitivity, but less than methacycline. The antifolates pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, sulfadoxine and sulfadiazine inhibited development allowing only emergence of the radicle. Dapsone, another antifolate, was effective under normal conditions, but was unstable showing reduced efficacy after light or dark pre-treatment of the medium, although the latter was not statistically significant at 95% confidence (P1=0.056). Amodiaquine, atovaquone, azithromycin, chloroquine, halofantrine, lumefantrine, mefloquine, piperaquine and primaquine did not have any herbicidal activity against A. thaliana at 20g/mL (Supplementary Fig. 1).. . . Calculating LD50 for herbicidal antimalarials. The antimalarial compounds that were stable and herbicidal at 20g/mL, were tested at a range of concentrations to determine potency alongside the herbicides glyphosate, glufosinate, asulam and atrazine as controls (Fig. 3A). Dose-response curves demonstrated a range of potencies (Fig. 3B,C) with the herbicides atrazine and asulam being the most potent compounds tested, with LD50 values of 0.19g/mL and 0.26g/mL, respectively. Of the eight antimalarial and antibiotic compounds tested here, the antibiotics ciprofloxacin (LD50=0.45g/mL) and clindamycin (LD50=0.9g/mL), and the antifolates sulfadiazine (LD50=0.86g/mL) and sulfadoxine (LD50=1.29g/mL) were the most herbicidal, notably with greater potency than glufosinate and glyphosate. The artemisinin derivate DHA was slightly more herbicidal than artesunate with LD50 values of 2.9g/mL and 5.0g/mL respectively. The antifolate cycloguanil (LD50=5.6g/mL) was of similar potency to pyrimethamine (LD50=7.1g/mL) and glyphosate (LD50=7.0g/mL). These data show some antimalarial compounds have similar or greater potency than the active ingredients of market herbicides.. . . The physicochemical properties of antimalarials vs herbicides. Although the physicochemical properties of herbicides and pharmaceuticals have much in common26, there are some consistent differences. Notably this includes the number of hydrogen bond donors, which in herbicides is rarely greater than one, whereas oral drugs can have up to five27. To determine whether the physicochemical properties of a specific antimalarial explains its herbicidal efficacy we subjected the tested compounds to a cluster analysis (Fig. 4) using an interactive database that compares and displays properties of 334 commercial herbicides26. In general, antimalarials have similar physicochemical properties to herbicides however compounds without herbicidal activity were often at the fringes, or outliers, when their physicochemical properties were mapped onto those of herbicides (Fig. 4). For example the larger compounds halofantrine, lumefantrine and piperaquine were outliers when polar surface area was plotted against molecular mass (Fig. 4D). Although their polar surface area is similar to herbicides with molecular masses of 150400, compared to herbicides with molecular mass above 500, the polar surface area of these three compounds is exceptionally low. Methacycline and doxycycline, which were herbicidal but light sensitive, were outliers in graphs of polar surface area versus distribution coefficient (Fig. 4C) and polar surface area versus molar mass (Fig. 4D). In general though physicochemical properties alone could not explain the efficacy for some compounds. Another explanation is that some antimalarial modes-of-action will target processes that do not exist in plants (e.g. haem-binding by chloroquine).. . . . Discussion. The present study aimed to assess whether antimalarial compounds that have been historically used to treat malaria are also active as herbicides against plants. We tested twenty compounds ranging from highly specific antimalarial drugs to antimalarial antibiotics and of these, eleven were as potent or more potent than some commercial herbicides (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1). As plants and malarial parasites share a common evolutionary history, we believe that inhibitors of malarial cellular components might also be active against the orthologous components in plants. Such compounds could offer novel chemistries with new modes-of-action for the development of plant-specific inhibitors. Herbicide discovery has dramatically declined since the widely used herbicide glyphosate and glyphosate-resistant crops were implemented28. Just over twenty herbicide modes-of-action are known and no new mode-of-action has been used for herbicides released in the past two decades29. The importance of designing novel herbicidal chemistries is further underlined when looking at the alarming number of 252 weed species that have evolved resistance to one or more herbicidal mode-of-action. To glyphosate alone there are 269 reported cases of resistance in 27 countries from all over the globe3031.. Inhibitors active against malarial parasites but showing only mild or no effect on plants can be explained by; (i) the active compound has no molecular targets in planta, (ii) the compound has a molecular target in planta, but interaction is prevented by physical barriers (e.g. root epidermis, leaf cuticle, lack of membrane transporters), (iii) the inhibitor has a target but is rapidly catabolised by the plant cell to be inactive.. The 4-aminoquinoline drugs chloroquine and amodiaquine have been widely used to prevent and treat malaria until resistant P. falciparum emerged3233. In Arabidopsis, neither compound was herbicidal. The mechanism of action of chloroquine is well established, and the chemically similar amodiaquine is assumed to act in a similar fashion34. During haemoglobin catabolism, free haem is converted by Plasmodium into its insoluble and non-toxic form called haemozoin. Chloroquine binds to free haem, which prevents its conversion and the parasite becomes susceptible to haem toxicity3536. Resistance to chloroquine is linked to mutations in membrane proteins of the parasite digestive vacuole3738. Although the mode-of-action of mefloquine, halofantrine, piperaquine and lumefantrine remains unclear, evidence suggests that they also interfere with haemozoin formation39. As haemoglobin and the process of converting haem to haemozoin is absent in plants, this may explain the lack of herbicidal activity observed for all these compounds.. Primaquine is an important drug active in the liver stage of Plasmodium infections, mainly in P. vivax40. Its mechanism of action, although unclear, is thought to involve disruption of mitochondrial function41. It is suggested that primaquine metabolism in the body leads to the production of reactive intermediates and free radicals which account for its activity42. As primaquine showed no herbicidal activity against Arabidopsis and given that primaquine metabolism is required for its antimalarial activity, it is possible that primaquine is not metabolised in planta, thus remains inactive.. The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin is a semi-synthetic erythromycin derivative. Although it has activity against P. falciparum, especially in synergy with quinine43, azithromycin is a relatively weak antimalarial both in mono- and combination therapy44. In bacteria, azithromycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit and blocks transpeptidation and polypeptide translocation during translation, therefore inhibiting protein synthesis45. In vitro studies using Plasmodium species also showed that azithromycin could inhibit parasite invasion of red blood cells, a role independent of inhibition of protein synthesis46. In our study, azithromycin did not display herbicidal activity, possibly due to a lack of target. Alternatively, azithromycin might be able to target ribosomal functions in Arabidopsis as it does in bacteria, but lacks the required physicochemical properties to be active in plants (Fig. 4A,B and D).. Doxycycline and methacycline are broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotics. In prokaryotes, tetracyclines block protein translation by binding to the ribosomal 30S subunit47. Although the mechanism of action for tetracyclines in Plasmodium remains unclear, doxycycline has been shown to act by disrupting the expression of apicoplast-encoded genes48. In Arabidopsis, doxycycline and methacycline induced bleaching of the cotyledons (Fig. 2). This might indicate that tetracyclines affect chloroplast function or have downstream effects on protein synthesis that leads to chlorophyll depletion. Although these compounds showed potential as herbicide leads, both compounds are light-sensitive, a downside of tetracycline antibiotics49. For obvious reasons, photo-sensitivity limits a compound being considered as an herbicidal lead.. Clindamycin is a semi-synthetic lincomycin derivative with antibiotic, antimalarial and anti-apicomplexan (e.g. Toxoplasma gondii) activities50. In prokaryotes, clindamycin binds the 50S ribosomal subunit and prevents interaction of peptidyl-tRNA with the ribosome, thereby inhibiting protein translation51. In protozoan parasites, clindamycin targets the apicoplast large rRNA subunit as inferred from clindamycin-resistant T. gondii mutants that harbour a point mutation in the apicoplast large rRNA subunit52. Clindamycin was revealed to be one of the most herbicidal compounds, with greater activity than glufosinate and glyphosate. Except for azithromycin, all inhibitors of protein synthesis tested here were herbicidal. Their mode-of-action in Arabidopsis could be similar to that in bacteria and protozoa. In terms of potency, ciprofloxacin, a quinolone-based antibiotic, was also more active than glufosinate and glyphosate in the plate assay (Fig. 4). It was recently shown that A. thaliana DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, is the target of ciprofloxacin through the identification of a point mutation in the ATGYRA gene responsible for ciprofloxacin resistance in an A. thaliana genetic mutant53. Of the 20 known herbicide modes-of-action, DNA gyrase is not a current target of any market herbicide26, making the mode-of-action of ciprofloxacin an attractive avenue for the development of new herbicides.. Artesunate and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) are semi-synthetic derivatives of the antimalarial agent artemisinin, a natural product found in the Chinese herb Artemisia annua54. Artemisinin derivatives are the most widely used antimalarial drugs and are important components of artemisinin derivative-based combination therapies for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria55. The molecular mechanisms by which artemisinins act as antimalarials are still unclear and multiple modes-of-action have been proposed including interfering with iron-haem interactions and stimulating the formation of radical intermediates5657, targeting of a calcium-ATPase transport protein, PfATP6 which affects calcium levels required for parasite invasion in red blood cells58 and interference in the formation of polyphosphorylated phosphoinositides, which are important regulators of signalling and trafficking functions in most eukaryotes59. Both artesunate and DHA were potent herbicides and although using such important compounds in an herbicidal context is unlikely, using A. thaliana as a model to gain insight into its mode-of-action might be sought.. The antifolates are important inhibitors of folate synthesis and metabolism. Folate and its derivatives are essential co-factors for DNA synthesis and production of several amino acids60. Of the enzymes involved in the folate pathway, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) are well described as the molecular targets of important antifolate drugs. In both Plasmodium parasites and plants, DHFR is part of a bifunctional protein with thymidylate synthetase (DHFR-TS). Plant DHPS is also part of a bifunctional protein with hydroxymethylpterin pyrophoskinase (PPPK-DHPS)61. Pyrimethamine and cycloguanil inhibit P. falciparum DHFR-TS by binding DHFR62, whereas the sulfa-based drugs sulfadoxine, sulfadiazine and dapsone act by binding DHPS in bacteria and protozoans6364. Here, all DHFR and DHPS inhibitors tested were herbicidal with dapsone the only compound that displayed photosensitivity. In addition all the compounds display good herbicidal physicochemical properties and as Arabidopsis and Plasmodium share the bifunctional-type DHFR and DHPS proteins, we expect the antifolate drugs tested here to have the same mode-of-action in plants and could present interesting starting points for new herbicidal development.. The mode-of-action for many antimalarials, some in use for decades, are unclear or unknown. As a result this prevents a greater understanding of the biological action of the compound and also prevents development of more potent compounds for the target. Some examples are the artemisinin-based compounds whose mode-of-action remains controversial and other, novel and promising antimalarial compounds whose modes-of-action remain to be investigated65. If the evolutionary relationship between Arabidopsis and Plasmodium is close enough that the antimalarial compounds have the same mode-of-action and same targets, the genetically tractable A. thaliana might have a place to study the biological action of these materials. Chemically mutagenized seeds could be sown and grown under drug selection to find resistant plants and map-based cloning of the resistance lesions could reveal the target or explain the compounds mode-of-action. Such a strategy has been employed by Jander et al.66 in the study of herbicide resistance where screens that used chlorsulfuron and imazethapyr found lesions in their target, acetolactate synthase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acids. Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin, are known topoisomerase inhibitors and have been shown to have potential as antimalarial compounds67. A mutagenesis strategy using A. thaliana seeds and screening for resistant plants found a genetic mutation in the equivalent plant target of ciprofloxacin, DNA gyrase A53 thus demonstrating the tractability of using A. thaliana to identify putative modes-of-action. Such a forward genetic approach using A. thaliana would not work for all antimalarial drugs, but would be very useful for protein targets where gene loss or single amino acid substitutions can render plants resistant to the compound.. . . Conclusions. Our study shows that compounds designed for treating malaria also display herbicidal activity. As antimalarial drugs are non-toxic to humans and display, in general, good physicochemical properties (e.g. water solubility) these make them attractive bioactive molecules. Due to the alarming recent increases in herbicide resistance, such compounds could offer a good starting point in the design of new herbicidal chemistries. Here we show that some antimalarials are as potent, or more potent, than the active components of commercial herbicides. From these observations, a few questions are raised; do all herbicidal antimalarials act in plants in similar ways as in malaria parasites, that is, do they inhibit similar proteins or affect the same pathways? If so, mutagenesis of the genetically tractable A. thaliana and screening for drug resistant plants could reveal the modes-of-action for understudied antimalarial drugs in the same way that forward genetics can reveal targets for herbicides. Another use of this cross-over concept is whether the significant resources that have become available for the development of antimalarial lead compounds could also be used to develop novel herbicides. The alarming rise globally in herbicide resistance in weeds30 is driving the agrochemical industry to search for new lead compounds and ideally, compounds with novel modes-of-action.. . . Methods. . Germination assays. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 seeds were surface sterilised for 3min in 70% ethanol, followed by 1min in 100% ethanol and then soaked for 3min in sterile water. Seeds were re-suspended in sterile 0.1% agar and incubated at 4C for 3 days to synchronise subsequent germination. Following this stratification treatment, seeds were sown on 96-well microplates (TrueLine, USA) with each well containing 0.25mL of growth medium (1% agar, 1% glucose, 0.45% Murashige & Skoog salts with vitamins, 0.3% 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) (v/v), pH 5.7) and the appropriate dose of DMSO, antimalarial, antibiotic or herbicide. Plates were sealed with porous tape and transferred to a chamber at 22C for two weeks under 16h days and 60% relative humidity before a photo of each plate was taken. To initially determine the herbicidal nature of the antimalarial compounds, a screen using a single concentration was performed (20g/mL). If herbicidal activity was displayed, the assay was repeated with a range of concentrations. To investigate compound stability, plates were pre-treated for one week prior to seed sowing either by being left under lights at 22C or in the dark at 4C. Growth of seeds sown on these pre-treated plates were compared to seeds sown on freshly prepared plates.. . . Commercial herbicides, antimalarials and antibiotics. Twenty-eight compounds were tested for an herbicidal effect on A. thaliana. Eight commercially available herbicides were compared to twenty antimalarial compounds (Table 1). Amodiaquine, chloroquine, ciprofloxacin, glufosinate ammonium, glyphosate and oryzalin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Artesunate was obtained from Pharbaco Central Pharmaceutical J.S.C., mefloquine from Roche, and asulam from Sapphire Bioscience.

PMC5359625	Introduction. Seed dormancy and germination are crucial stages in a plants life. In wild plant species, seed dormancy plays a key role in ensuring survival by blocking germination until conditions become favorable for the later stages of germination and growth of that species (Bewley, 1997). Unlike many wild plant species, cultivated crops such as barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) display weak grain dormancy at maturity due to selective breeding against dormancy for uniform and vigorous germination on industrial and agricultural fields. For malting barley, long dormancy increases costs and potential damage resulting from grain storage (Carn, 1980). In addition, cool, moist conditions in the field can disrupt seed dormancy and cause PHS, resulting in serious losses of grain yield and quality (Gubler et al., 2005; Rodrguez et al., 2015). Therefore, research aimed at understanding environmental and genetic controls of dormancy will assist in the development of new strategies for industrial utilization and the elimination of PHS worldwide in domesticated crops.. Plant hormones such as GAs and ABA play key roles in seed dormancy and germination. In particular, ABA is considered to be the key molecule in dormancy induction and maintenance (Finkelstein et al., 2008; Rodrguez et al., 2015; Shu et al., 2016). During seed development, embryonic ABA is required to impose lasting dormancy (Nambara and Marion-Poll, 2005), and de novo ABA synthesis in the embryo during imbibition ensures maintenance of dormancy (Kucera et al., 2005). Dormancy release by after-ripening is mediated by a decrease in ABA content in imbibed wheat and barley grains as a result of the coordinated promotion of ABA catabolism and repression of ABA biosynthesis genes (Millar et al., 2006; Jacobsen et al., 2013). In several species, the transcriptional regulation of nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) and ABA-8-hydroxylase (ABA8OH) genes are considered key steps in this control mechanism (Nambara et al., 2010). In barley, HvNCED1 is particularly important in the regulation of primary dormancy in blue light (Gubler et al., 2008) or at high temperatures (Leymarie et al., 2008), whereas HvNCED2 expression has been implicated in the induction of primary dormancy (Chono et al., 2006) and the maintenance of secondary dormancy (Leymarie et al., 2008). The HvABA8OH1 gene plays a major role in that ABA catabolism that is required to alleviate barley grain dormancy (Chono et al., 2006; Millar et al., 2006; Gubler et al., 2008). ABA functions are regulated, in part, by crosstalk with other hormones such as GA and their associated signaling networks. Application of GA, an antagonist of ABA, can break dormancy in cereals (Jacobsen et al., 2002; Tuttle et al., 2015).. Recently, it was reported that several signal molecules such as nitric oxide (NO) and ROS also regulate seed dormancy and germination (Ma et al., 2016). In barley, ROS break seed dormancy and promote germination (Fontaine et al., 1994; Ishibashi et al., 2010; Bahin et al., 2011). The relationships between ROS, seed dormancy, and germination have been described for many plant species, including Zinnia elegans, and sunflower (Ogawa and Iwabuchi, 2001; Oracz et al., 2007). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is a ROS, is regarded as a signaling hub for the regulation of seed dormancy and germination; the precise regulation of H2O2 accumulation by the cell antioxidant machinery is essential to achieve a balance between oxidative signaling that promotes germination and oxidative damage that prevents or delays germination (Wojtyla et al., 2016). These findings were clearly summarized and presented by Bailly et al. (2008) as the principle of the oxidative window for germination. According to this hypothesis, both lower and higher levels of ROS impair seed germination, which is only possible within a defined range of concentrations.. Recent evidence shows that the selective oxidation of proteins and mRNAs can act as a positive regulator of seed germination (Job et al., 2005; Oracz et al., 2007; Barba-Espn et al., 2010; Bazin et al., 2011). Bazin et al. (2011) showed that approximately 24 stored mRNAs undergo oxidation during sunflower (Helianthus annuus) after-ripening. ROS production during germination contributes to reserve mobilization through oxidative modifications of stored proteins; storage organs may then recognize these modifications as signals to mobilize reserves to the rapidly growing axis. Due to the abundance of available seed storage proteins, the oxidized forms of these proteins such as heat shock proteins and elongation factors can also be considered as actor of ROS signaling in seed germination (Job et al., 2005; Barba-Espn et al., 2010). Oracz et al. (2007) proposed a mechanism for seed dormancy release that involves a change in proteome oxidation resulting from the accumulation of ROS during the after-ripening phase.. The breaking of dormancy by ROS has also been reported in relation to plant hormone signaling in several seeds (El-Maarouf-Bouteau et al., 2013). Studies on phytohormone interactions in germinated seeds have shown that exogenously applied ABA inhibits ROS accumulation in barley (Ishibashi et al., 2012), rice (Oryza sativa; Ye et al., 2012), lettuce (Zhang et al., 2014), and sunflower (El-Maarouf-Bouteau et al., 2015). By contrast, the addition of GA enhances the production of ROS, mainly superoxide and H2O2, found in radish plants (Schopfer et al., 2001) and Arabidopsis (Liu et al., 2010; Lariguet et al., 2013). Bahin et al. (2011) suggested that exogenously applied H2O2 does not influence ABA biosynthesis and signaling but has a pronounced effect on GA signaling, resulting in the modulation of hormonal balance and in subsequent germination initiation. The modulation of phytohormone balance during germination by exogenously applied H2O2 is also a product of changes in H2O2 levels in seeds treated with GA and ABA. Exogenous H2O2 and NADPH oxidase inhibitor increased ABA catabolism by enhancing the expression of CYP707A genes, which encode ABA 8-hydroxylases, and enhanced the expression of genes for GA synthesis in dormant Arabidopsis seeds (Liu et al., 2010) and non-dormant barley seeds (Ishibashi et al., 2015). In non-dormant barley seeds, H2O2 accumulation via superoxide produced by NADPH oxidases promote GA biosynthesis in embryos; the resulting GA induces and activates NADPH oxidases in aleurone cells, and the H2O2 accumulated by the NADPH oxidases induce -amylase in these cells (Ishibashi et al., 2015). Therefore, it is likely that ROS is central molecule in the regulation of barley seed dormancy and germination through GA and ABA. However, the role of H2O2 interactions with phytohormones in the regulation of barley seed dormancy and germination is still open to debate. The mechanism of dormancy breaking by ROS needs to be examined in detail. In this study, we, therefore, focused on the balance between plant hormones and ROS in dormant and non-dormant seeds.. . . Materials and Methods. . Plant Material. Hordeum vulgare L. Ichibanboshi grains, which were grown at Kyushu University, were harvested on June 5, 2010. Experiments were carried out with dormant grains that had been stored at -28C from harvest until the experiments began in order to maintain their initial dormancy (Lenoir et al., 1983). Non-dormant grains were used as controls (i.e., grains from the same harvest but stored for 6 months at 23C).. . . Germination Test. Five replications of 20 seeds each sterilized with sodium hypochlorite were placed on filter paper in a 9-cm Petri dish, to which 6 mL of a solution of 100 mM hydrogen peroxide, 20 mM sodium ascorbate, and distilled water as control was added. The dishes were then incubated in the dark at 22C (CRB-41L, HITACHI), and the germinating seeds, defined as seeds whose radical protruded through the seed coat, were counted daily for 5 days.. . . Hydrogen Peroxide Content. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in embryos isolated from seed after imbibition was measured according to the method of Oracz et al. (2007) by using a peroxidase-based assay with 3-dimethylaminobenzoic acid and 1.3 mM 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone to measure H2O2 (OKane et al., 1996).. . . ABA Content. To measure the ABA content in embryos, we isolated embryos from 20 seeds that had imbibed for 48 h and stored them at -80C. ABA levels were measured by using a Phytodetek Competitive ELISA kit (Agdia). Each experiment comprised five biological replicates.. . . Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from embryos isolated after germination treatment or from embryoless half-seeds by using the SDS/phenol/LiCl method (Chirgwin et al., 1979). cDNA synthesis and amplification were conducted as described by Ishibashi et al. (2015). The amount of each gene transcript was normalized against the amount of mRNA for HvActin (Trevaskis et al., 2006) by using the method of Pfaffl (2001). The sequences for the HvActin primer came from Ishibashi et al. (2015); the other primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S1.. . . Barley Transient Expression Assay. The plasmid was transformed by particle bombardment into immature embryos according to the method of Pellegrineschi et al. (2002) and Nakamura et al. (2011). For this assay, H. vulgare L. Seijo-17 immature grains, which were grown at Kyushu University, were harvested, and immature embryos isolated from the immature grain. The immature embryos were bombarded with each plasmid, Ubi:HvCAT or Ubi:GUS, which was constructed to express each gene under the control of the promoter region and the first intron of the maize ubiquitin (Ubi-1) gene (Toki et al., 1992; Christensen and Quail, 1996). After bombardment, the immature embryos were transferred to 1/2MS medium containing 200 mg/L MES and 30 g/L maltose, and were incubated at 25C for 2.5 days. We checked introduction of each genes using RT-PCR (Supplementary Figure S1).. . . Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay. The EMSA was performed as described by Wang et al. (2011). Recombinant pGEX-HvABI5 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE. The E. coli cells were lysed by sonication, and purified with glutathioneSepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). Double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the ACGT core motif upstream of HvCAT2 was prepared and carried out labeling according to the protocol provided with the DIG Kit (Roche Diagnostics). EMSAs were carried out using a DIG Gel Shift kit, 2nd Generation (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturers instructions. The primer sequences for constructing the pGEX-HvABI5 vector and the probe sequences for the EMSA are shown in Supplementary Table S1.. . . Enzyme Activities. To measure enzyme activities, we isolated embryos from 20 seeds that had imbibed for 48 h and stored them at -80C. The enzyme activities of APX, GPX, SOD, and CAT were measured as described by Ishibashi et al. (2008). NADPH oxidase activity was assayed according to the method of Van Gestelen et al. (1997) and Sarath et al. (2007). Protein concentration was determined by using the method Bradford (1976). The results are expressed as mol mg-1 protein.. . . . Results. . Germination Rate and Hydrogen Peroxide Content of Dormant and Non-dormant Seeds. Non-dormant seeds had a germination rate of 22% at 1 day after imbibition (DAI), and 85% had germinated at 3 DAI. Dormant seeds had a germination rate of 27 and 50% at 3 and 5 DAI, respectively (Figure 1A). At 2 DAI, the H2O2 content in the non-dormant seeds was higher six times that in the dormant seeds (Figures 1B,C). In addition, nine barley cultivars that were at different stages of dormancy had positive correlations with the H2O2 contents of their embryos after imbibition (Supplementary Figure S2). These data strongly suggest that non-dormant seeds accumulate H2O2 in the embryo after imbibition, but dormant seeds do not.. . FIGURE 1. . Germination percentage and hydrogen peroxide content in dormant and non-dormant seeds. (A) Time course of the percentage of germination of dormant (closed circles) and non-dormant (open circles) seeds. Embryos removed from dormant (B) and non-dormant (C) seeds after imbibition were used to determine hydrogen peroxide contents (n = 5).. . . . . . Hydrogen Peroxide and Sodium Ascorbate Regulate Barley Seed Germination through ABA Catabolism. The germination rate of dormant seeds treated with H2O2 was significantly higher than that of the control (Figure 2A). In contrast, the germination rate of non-dormant seeds treated with sodium ascorbate was significantly lower than that of the control (Figure 2B). In addition, H2O2 and sodium ascorbate treatments were increased and decreased the H2O2 contents in the embryos after imbibition, respectively (Supplementary Figure S4). We previously reported that a decrease in ROS, induced by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI, in the embryos of barley seeds suppressed ABA catabolism in those embryos after imbibition (Ishibashi et al., 2015). Therefore, we examined ABA content and biosynthesis, as well as the expression of ABA catabolism-related genes, in the embryos of dormant or non-dormant seeds treated with sodium ascorbate or H2O2, respectively. In the dormant seeds, the ABA content of the embryos treated with H2O2 was significantly decreased compared with that in the control (Figure 2C). In the non-dormant seeds, the ABA content of the embryos treated with sodium ascorbate was significantly higher than that in the control (Figure 2D). The expression of HvNCED1, one of the ABA biosynthesis-related genes and a key gene regulating primary dormancy of barley (Millar et al., 2006), in the embryos did not differ significantly regardless of dormancy or treatment (Figures 2E,F). However, the expression of ABA8-OH1, one of the ABA catabolism-related genes and a key gene regulating primary dormancy of barley (Millar et al., 2006), in the embryo, was suppressed by sodium ascorbate in the non-dormant seeds and increased by H2O2 in the dormant seeds (Figures 2G,H). These results indicate that ROS regulate ABA catabolism in the embryos of non-dormant and dormant seeds by regulating HvABA8-OH1.. . FIGURE 2. .

Activities of Antioxidant Enzymes and NADPH Oxidase in the Embryos of Non-dormant and Dormant Seeds. Then, we examined the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as APX, GPX, SOD, and CAT, as well as the activity of NADPH oxidase (Figure 3), because the H2O2 contents of the embryos during germination were higher in non-dormant seeds than in dormant seeds (Figure 1). APX activity in the embryos of dormant seeds was significantly higher than that of the embryos of non-dormant seeds (Figure 3A), although GPX activity was the same in the embryos of both non-dormant and dormant seeds (Figure 3B). In contrast, SOD and CAT activities in the embryos of dormant seeds were significantly lower than those in the embryos of non-dormant seeds (Figures 3C,D). We previously reported that NADPH oxidase plays a role in barley seed germination through the regulation of GA and ABA signaling (Ishibashi et al., 2015). Therefore, we examined NADPH oxidase activity in the embryos of dormant and non-dormant seeds (Figure 3E). NADPH oxidase activity was significantly higher in non-dormant seeds than in dormant seeds. These results suggest that the production of ROS in the embryos of barley seeds after imbibition is regulated by SOD, CAT, and NADPH oxidase.. . FIGURE 3. .

Transient Expression of CAT in Immature Embryos Decreases Their Ability to Germinate. We examined the expression of HvSOD and HvCAT in the embryos of non-dormant and dormant seeds. After 24 h imbibition, the expression of HvSOD and HvCAT2 was increased in the embryos of dormant seeds compared with that in the embryos of non-dormant seeds (Figures 4A,C), while, after 48 h imbibition, the expression of HvSOD and HvCAT2 were high in the embryo of non-dormant and dormant seeds, respectively (Figures 4B,D). SOD catalyzes the reduction of the superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide, and CAT catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water. In wheat, the expression of CAT in dormant seeds was higher than that in non-dormant seeds during seed maturation (Ishibashi et al., 2008). In sunflower seed, relationship between CAT activity and germination is a quite close (Bailly et al., 1998). Additionally, Bahin et al. (2011) have reported that the CAT regulates hydrogen peroxide content in embryo of barley dormant seed. Therefore, we focus on the role of CAT in barley seed dormancy and germination. To examine the function of HvCAT2, which directly scavenges hydrogen peroxide, in barley seed germination, we transiently overexpressed HvCAT2 in immature embryos and examined their germination. HvCAT2 driven by the maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter (Ubi:HvCAT2) was directly bombarded into immature embryos isolated from Himalaya seeds at approximately 10 days after anthesis. In general, cultured immature wheat embryos germinate precociously (Williamson et al., 1985). However, we observed a significant decrease in the germination percentage of immature embryos that were transformed with Ubi:HvCAT2 (Figure 4E). In contrast, immature embryos transformed with the control construct -glucuronidase (GUS) driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter (Ubi:GUS) germinated well (Figure 4E). Nakamura et al. (2011) previously reported that the Ubi:TaMFT construct, in a similar transient assay, completely suppressed the germination of immature embryos of wheat because the TaMFT protein moved from the scutellum and coleorhiza to other parts of the seed. The partial effect of Ubi:HvCAT2 in our study was likely caused by scavenging H2O2 which across cell membranes in plants (Hooijmaijers et al., 2012), even though HvCAT2 cannot move from the scutellum and coleorhiza to other parts of the seed.. . FIGURE 4. . Expression of HvSOD and HvCAT2 in dormant and non-dormant seeds and the germination percentage in the transient HvCAT2 expression assay.

D, dormant seed; ND, non-dormant seed. (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, Students test, n = 5).. . . . . . ABA Regulates the Expression of HvCAT2 through HvABI5. Abscisic acid significantly increased the expression of HvCAT2 in the barley seed embryo (Figures 5A,B). To explore the underlying mechanisms by which ABA regulates the expression of HvCAT2 during seed germination, we analyzed the promoter sequences of HvCAT2 and found an ABA response element (ABRE), which is a cis-acting element recognized by several bZIP transcription factors, such as ABI5, AREB1, AREB2, and ABF3, that function in ABA signal transduction (Supplementary Figure S5; Finkelstein and Lynch, 2000). These bZIP transcription factors mediate downstream gene expression in Arabidopsis upon binding to the ABRE (Furihata et al., 2006; Yoshida et al., 2010). Our finding suggests that the expression of HvCAT2 may be regulated by bZIP transcription factors involved in ABA signaling. Indeed, the expression of HvABI5 in the barley seed embryo was increased by ABA (Figures 5C,D). Therefore, to test this possibility, we used EMSA analyses to investigate whether HvABI5 directly binds to the promoter of HvCAT2 containing the ABRE element (Figure 5E). The recombinant protein of GSTHvABI5 showed binding activities to HvCAT2 promoter fragment, and the DNA-binding activity was suppressed by competitor.. . FIGURE 5. .

The present study demonstrates that the balance between ABA and ROS in the barley seed embryo is involved in the regulation of seed dormancy and germination. The first line of evidence supporting this conclusion is the relationship between seed dormancy and H2O2 level, because the degree of seed dormancy was dependent on the H2O2 levels in the embryo after imbibition (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2). Additionally, germination rate of dormant seeds were promoted by H2O2 and suppressed by sodium ascorbate, while that of non-dormant seeds were suppressed by sodium ascorbate, but not promoted by H2O2 (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S3). There have been several reports about the relationship between ROS and seed dormancy and germination, many of which are focused on phytohormone signaling and ROS involvement (Oracz and Karpiski, 2016). H2O2 has been implicated in dormancy alleviation via its activation of GA signaling and synthesis rather than repression of ABA signaling (Bahin et al., 2011). In sunflower seed, however, ROS interact at the transcriptional level with the ABA signaling pathway (El-Maarouf-Bouteau et al., 2015). We previously reported that ROS produced by NADPH oxidase in the embryos of barley seeds promoted the catabolism of ABA (Ishibashi et al., 2015). In the present study, NADPH oxidase activity in the embryos of non-dormant seeds was higher than that in the embryos of dormant seeds (Figure 3E). In non-dormant seeds, ABA content in the embryos treated with ascorbate was higher than that in treated with distilled water, whereas, in dormant seeds, the ABA content in the embryos treated with H2O2 was lower than in treated with distilled water (Figures 2C,D). In addition, the regulation of ABA in the embryos of both dormant and non-dormant seeds could be attributed to the induction of HvABA8-OH1 by ROS (Figures 2G,H). Two genes encoding ABA8-OH have been identified in barley, and HvABA8OH1 is predominantly expressed in the embryos of imbibing seeds (Millar et al., 2006). Of note, HvABA8OH1 expression is closely associated with ABA level and germination capacity (Chono et al., 2006). Consistent with these facts, the knocking down of ABA8OH1 leads to increased seed ABA levels and to enhanced dormancy (Gubler et al., 2008). ROS produced after imbibition is involved in the regulation of barley seed dormancy and germination through the catabolism of ABA; therefore, we focused on the mechanism of ROS production. It had been reported that ROS generated by NADPH oxidases regulate barley seed germination through GA/ABA metabolism and signaling in the embryo and aleurone cells (Ishibashi et al., 2015). In the present study, H2O2 content and NADPH oxidase activity in the embryos of dormant seeds were lower than those in the embryos of non-dormant seeds (Figures 1B,C, 3E). In the embryos of barley seeds, ABA suppressed the activity of NADPH oxidases (Ishibashi et al., 2015). The decrease in ABA content by catabolism in the embryo after imbibition is promoted by ROS production through NADPH oxidase. In Arabidopsis, ABA treatment induces the expression of NADPH oxidases (AtrbohD and AtrbohF) in guard cells (Kwak et al., 2003). The ROS enhanced by NADPH oxidase could result in enhanced ABA accumulation, whereas enhanced ABA could result in enhanced ROS production in guard cells, creating a positive feedback loop to mediate stomatal closure (Mittler and Blumwald, 2015). Our results indicate that in the embryo after imbibition, ROS and ABA act antagonistically to regulate seed dormancy and germination, although this suggestion is inconsistent with other reports.. In this study, we also examined the activity of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and peroxidases (APX, GPX) that can scavenge ROS. The CAT activities in the embryos of the dormant seeds were significantly higher than those in the embryos of the non-dormant seeds (Figure 3D). These results suggest that the H2O2 contents in the embryos of dormant and non-dormant seeds depend on CAT activity. CAT is reported to play an important role in the seed germination process. CAT expression levels increase in germinating sunflower seeds prior to radicle protrusion, with a concomitant decrease in H2O2 content (Bailly, 2004). A similar increase in CAT activity has been described during the germination of maize, soybean, Arabidopsis, and sweet corn seeds (Puntarulo et al., 1991; Gallardo et al., 2001; Posmyk et al., 2001; Chiu et al., 2002). In dormant barley seeds, H2O2 treatment induced an increase in CAT activity that was associated with accumulation of the HvCAT2 transcript in the embryos (Bahin et al., 2011). Barley has two CAT isozymes, HvCAT1 and HvCAT2; however, HvCAT1 was not expressed in our embryos (data not shown). In the present study, the expression of HvCAT2 in the embryos of dormant seeds was significantly higher than in those of non-dormant seeds (Figure 4A). In nine cultivars that were at different stages of dormancy, HvCAT2 expression correlated with the germination index except for one cultivar (Supplementary Figure S6). In addition, precocious germination of isolated immature embryos was suppressed by the transient introduction of HvCAT2 driven by the maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter (Figure 4E). These results indicated that CAT is involved in germination of barley seed after imbibition through the regulation of ROS.. The expression of HvCAT2 was suppressed by ABA (Figures 5A,B, also Bahin et al., 2011); therefore, we investigated the promoter sequence of HvCAT2. The promoter sequence included an ABA-responsive element (ABRE), an ABRE-related coupling element (CE), and RY repeat motifs (Supplementary Figure S5). Interestingly, the promoter of Sdr4, which regulates rice seed dormancy, has seven RY repeats, which are important for seed-specific gene expression and are the target of the VP1/ABI3 subfamily of B3 domain transcription factors (Baumlein et al., 1992), along with the ABRE and CE (Sugimoto et al., 2010). The dormancy state is characterized by the transcription of genes with large numbers of ABRE sequences to which transcription factors like ABI5 bind to regulate seed dormancy (Finch-Savage and Leubner-Metzger, 2006). In the present study, the expression of HvABI5 in the embryos was increased by ABA (Figure 5C), but not HvVP1 (data not shown). Moreover, we determined that recombinant HvABI5 binds to the HvCAT2 promoter including the ABRE (Figure 5E). These results suggest that the expression of HvCAT2 is regulated through HvABI5 induced by ABA.. Bahin et al. (2011) suggested that H2O2 plays a role in the alleviation of barley seed dormancy through the activation of GA signaling and/or biosynthesis rather than through the inhibition of ABA signaling. They found that exogenously applied H2O2 does not influence ABA biosynthesis and signaling but does have a pronounced effect on GA signaling, resulting in the modulation of hormonal balance and in subsequent germination initiation. However, by using dormant and non-dormant seeds in this study, we found that H2O2 regulated ABA content through HvABA8-OH1-mediated catabolism of ABA (Figures 2C,D,G,H). Liu et al. (2010) proposed a hypothetical model that explains the interrelationships between H2O2 and NO in the regulation of Arabidopsis seed germination in terms of the joint actions of ABA and GA. According to this model, H2O2 can interrupt the dormancy of Arabidopsis seeds through two pathways. The first pathway relies on the enhancement of ABA catabolism and GA biosynthesis. The signaling molecule (NO) does not regulate GA biosynthesis directly but instead acts as a temporary signaling molecule involved in the H2O2 regulation of ABA catabolism. The second pathway assumes negative regulation of GA biosynthesis by ABA. We previously reported that ROS induced by NADPH oxidase regulate barley seed germination by promoting ABA catabolism and GA biosynthesis (Ishibashi et al., 2015). Our results in this study suggest that dormant seeds maintain high ABA contents, promoting HvCAT2 expression through ABI5 for H2O2 catabolism. In addition, ABA catabolism through HvABA8OH1 was promoted by H2O2. Therefore, dormant seeds had low ROS contents with decreased HvABA8OH1 expression, which maintained high ABA contents. Taken together, our findings suggest that the interrelationship between ABA and ROS may play an important role in seed dormancy and germination, as shown in Figure 6, although it should also be added that the mechanism might be included in seedling stage.. .

PMC5362889	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a classic plant hormone that was first identified in the early 1960s. ABA was originally proposed to be involved in abscission1 and has since been shown to play a role in plant growth and development, including cell division and elongation, embryo maturation, seed dormancy, germination, root growth, floral induction, and responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses, such as osmotic stress, chilling, high salinity, drought, pathogen attack and UV radiation2345678. In Arabidopsis, three core components within the ABA signalling pathway have been identified: the ABA receptor PYR/PYL/RCAR (PYL) protein family, the negative regulator type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) and the positive regulator class III SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2)91011. ABA receptors are a family of soluble proteins, referred to as PYLs, that constitute the beginning of the core ABA signalling pathway39. ABA binds to a PYL protein, resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity of PP2Cs and relieving the inhibition of SnRKs required to turn on downstream gene expression to convert ABA signals into the appropriate cellular responses12131415.. The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg) is a tropical tree belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is wildly cultivated to produce natural rubber (cis 1,4-polyisoprene). Natural rubber is obtained from the latex of the rubber tree. Latex is the cytoplasm of highly specialized cells known as laticifers in rubber trees16. Laticifers in the bark of a rubber tree are specific for rubber biosynthesis and defence against pathogen attacks17. Plant hormones play a crucial role in natural rubber biosynthesis. Laticifers are jasmonate acid (JA) responsive, as their differentiation is specifically induced by exogenous jasmonate18. Moreover, natural rubber biosynthesis in laticifers may be mainly regulated by JA signalling192021. Ethylene (ET) is widely applied regularly on the trunk of rubber trees to stimulate latex production2223. ABA treated rubber trees exhibited earlier significant response, leading to 4.3-fold significant increases in latex yield24, suggesting latex production maybe be also regulated by ABA signalling. SRPP is a major component of latex and clearly participates in the biosynthesis of natural rubber1725. In H. brasiliensis the HbSRPP gene is regulated by ABA26, and in Taraxacum brevicorniculatum the TbSRPP gene was also regulated in an ABA-dependent manner27, indicating that natural latex production may be primarily regulated by ABA. However, knowledge of the ABA signalling pathway in the rubber tree is limited.. A draft H. brasiliensis genome sequence was recently reported282930. The genome-wide ABA signalling pathway genes can now be identified and described. In the present study, a total of 14 PYL genes (designated HbPYL1 through HbPYL14) were identified in the genome of the rubber tree. These genes could be grouped into three subfamilies that correlated well with the corresponding Arabidopsis subfamilies. High levels of HbPYL expression were found in latex. These genes were regulated by ABA, JA and ET.. . Results. . Genome-wide identification of the HbPYL gene family in the rubber tree. To extensively identify rubber tree HbPYL genes, we employed BLAST and hidden Markov model searches to search the rubber tree genome database using PYL sequences from Arabidopsis and rice as queries. After removing redundant sequences, a total of 14 HbPYL genes were identified in the genome of the rubber tree, and further conserved domain detection confirmed that all of the identified HbPYLs harbour a conserved hydrophobic domain and belong to the PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptor gene family (Table 1). We named these 14 HbPYL genes HbPYL1 through HbPYL14 according to their sequence similarities to AtPYLs. The identified rubber tree HbPYL genes encode proteins ranging from 187 (HbPYL11) to 224 (HbPYL7) amino acid residues. The other characteristics of the HbPYL genes, including gene length, open reading frame (ORF) length, the isoelectric point (pI), molecular weight (MW), and exons, are listed in Table 1. ORF length ranged from 564bp (HbPYL11) to 675bp (HbPYL7), MW from 20.77 (HbPYL2) to 24.35 (HbPYL7) kDa, and pI from 4.83 (HbPYL1) to 7.85 (HbPYL5). Most of these proteins (78.57%) have a low pI (pI<7.0).. . . Conserved residues of HbPYLs. The results of amino acid sequence alignment indicated that the 14 HbPYLs shared a greater than 38.42% amino acid identity between pairs of sequences, with the maximum percentage of amino acid sequence identity being found between HbPYL10 and HbPYL11 (94.12%) (Table S1). All AtPYLs share a highly similar helix-grip structure characterized by a seven-stranded -sheet flanked by three -helices, and several conserved key amino acids have been found to be crucial for the function of ABA receptors. For example, the lysine located in the CL1 loop contributes to the interaction with ABA, and a highly conserved CL2 loop mediates the PYL-PP2C interaction. According to sequence alignment with reported AtPYLs, the HbPYLs all contain four identical conserved loops, which play important roles in ABA binding and PP2C interaction (Fig. 1).. . . Phylogenetic analysis. To characterize the evolutionary history and phylogenetic relationships between HbPYLs and other known PYLs from Arabidopsis and rice, phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted with MEGA version 6 by comparing 14 HbPYLs with 14 AtPYLs and 12 OsPYLs, and an unrooted neighbour-joining tree was created (Fig. 2). The results showed that the 14 HbPYLs could be assigned to 3 subfamilies, together with their orthologous PYLs from Arabidopsis and rice; HbPYL814, HbPYL47, and HbPYL13 were classified as subfamilies I, II and III, respectively.. . . Gene structure and conserved motifs of HbPYLs. To better understand the structural features of the HbPYL genes, intron/exon structure was detected based on their evolutionary relationships (Fig. 3). Gene structure analysis showed that the HbPYL gene members were clearly divided into a no intron clade and a two intron clade. No introns were detected in the HbPYL genes of subfamilies II and III, whereas all of the genes in subfamily I contained 2 introns, and these introns were typically flanked by GT and AG boundaries. In addition, the different HbPYL genes in each subfamily showed similar exon-intron structures, which supports their close evolutionary relationships and the classification of subfamilies.. Conserved motifs were also analysed for all 14 HbPYL proteins using MEME software. In total, twenty motifs were identified, and the details of each motif are shown in Fig. 4. The number of conserved motifs in each HbPYL varied between 7 and 11. Subfamily I contained more than ten motifs, whereas subfamilies II and III contained fewer than eight motifs. All of the proteins contained motifs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7. Furthermore, all of the proteins in subfamily I contained motifs 4 and 6, while subfamily II harboured motif 10. These results indicate that HbPYL members clustered in the same subfamily show similar motif characteristics, suggesting functional similarities among members in the same subfamily.. . . Cis elements of HbPYL promoters. To further elucidate the transcriptional regulation and potential functions of HbPYL genes, the upstream promoter sequences of the HbPYLs (7501500bp upstream of the initiation codon) were isolated and predicted (supplementary S1). A number of tissue-specific cis elements involved in the hormone stress response were found in the upstream sequences of the HbPYLs (Table 2). All of the HbPYL promoters except for that of HbPYL1 contained two or more cis elements involved in the plant hormone response, such as an abscisic acid response element, auxin-responsive element, MeJA-responsive element, ethylene-responsive element, gibberellin responsive element, or salicylic acid response element. Additionally, all of the HbPYL promoters contained three or more cis elements involved in stress responses, such as low-temperature, heat stress, and anaerobic response elements. Cell- and tissue-type-specific expression elements, such as CAT-boxes, GCN4_motifs and Skn-1_motifs, were also found in the upstream sequences of these HbPYLs. These results suggest that there is diversity in the regulation of HbPYL gene expression in response to hormones and stress responses as well as for growth and development.. . . Expression profile analysis of HbPYLs. To investigate the expression patterns of the HbPYLs in Hevea, qRT-PCR analysis of the HbPYLs was performed in rubber tree roots, bark, leaves, flowers, and latex. The tissue-specific expression profiles showed that all 14 HbPYLs were expressed in at least one tissue (Fig. 5). Five genes (HbPYL1, 8, 9, 11 and 12) were expressed in all of the tissues tested, although the transcript abundance of some genes in the tissues was very low. Four genes (HbPYL2, 3, 5 and 10) showed lower transcript abundance than the other genes in the above tissues. Eight genes (HbPYL6, 7, 914) were expressed at significantly higher levels in latex than in other tissues, whereas four genes (HbPYL2, 35) were expressed at very low levels or were not expressed in latex. In addition, pair-wise comparisons of the genes revealed similar expression patterns. For example, HbPYL6 and HbPYL7 showed much higher expression levels in latex, but HbPYL2 and HbPYL3 as well as HbPYL4 and HbPYL5 showed very low expression levels in latex. The subfamily I genes exhibited higher expression levels in latex, except for HbPYL10.. . . The expression patterns of HbPYLs in latex respond to JA, ET and ABA treatment. Ethrel is regularly applied to the trunks of rubber trees to stimulate the latex yield. JA is also a key factor related to the production of rubber trees. ABA is a ubiquitous hormone that regulates plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. The PYL proteins were identified as ABA receptors and are upstream of the ABA signalling network. To examine the expression patterns of HbPYLs, rubber tree shoots were treated with JA, ET or ABA. Nine genes (HbPYL1, 69, 1114) were found to present relatively high transcript abundance in latex and were investigated after treatment with JA, ET and ABA. The results as shown in Fig. 6. All nine genes responded to JA treatment, 8 of which (HbPYL1, 6, 89, 1114) were significantly up-regulated by at least 2.3-fold, while one (HbPYL7) was down-regulated 0.2-fold. Eight genes responded to ET treatment, 6 of which (HbPYL1, 78, 1113) were significantly up-regulated by at least 1.36-fold, whereas two genes (HbPYL6 and HbPYL14) were down-regulated (0.27- and 0.45-fold, respectively). Six genes responded to ABA treatment, 5 of which (HbPYL7, 8, 1113) were significantly up-regulated by at least 1.80-fold, while one (HbPYL6) was down-regulated 0.52-fold. Among the 9 genes, 6 (HbPYL6, 78, 1113) responded to all three treatments; 2 genes (HbPYL1 and HbPYL14) responded to two treatments; and HbPYL9 responded only to JA. Four genes (HbPYL8, HbPYL1113) were up-regulated by the three treatments. HbPYL6 was up-regulated by JA, but down-regulated by ET and ABA. By contrast, HbPYL7 was up-regulated by ET and ABA, but down-regulated by JA. HbPYL1 was up-regulated by JA and ET, and HbPYL 14 was up-regulated by JA but down-regulated by ET.. . . The genes involved in rubber biosynthesis in latex respond to ABA treatment. Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is the direct precursor for rubber biosynthesis and mainly derived from the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway17. HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) is a rate-controlling enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of HMG-CoA to MVA31. Post-IPP processes include initiation and elongation of rubber macromolecules. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) catalyzes the biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate. The farnesyl diphosphate acts as the prime which is essential for initiating prenyl chain whereas Hevea rubber transferase (HRT), rubber elongation factor (REF) and small rubber particle protein (SRPP) are crucial for integrating IPP units into prenyl chain1731. To examine the expression patterns of the genes involved in rubber biosynthesis in response to ABA, the rubber tree shoots were treated by ABA, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, ABA markedly up-regulated HbFPS1, HbHRT1, HbHRT2, HbSRPP and HbREF expression, except HbHMGR expression.. . . . Discussion. In plants, ABA is a major mediator of plant stress responses and many developmental programmes32. Recently, PYLs has been identified as bona fide ABA receptors. PYLs together with PP2Cs, Snf1 and SnRK2s and downstream substrates constitute the core ABA signaling network. PYLs have been characterized in Arabidopsis, rice and tomato. For example, the PYL family consists of 14 members in Arabidopsis1315, 12 members in rice33 and 14 members in tomato34. Most studies on ABA receptors have focused on those of Arabidopsis, whereas only a few of these receptors have been characterized in other plants, such as the rubber tree. The current report presents 14 members of the PYL family identified in the rubber tree based on publicly available data. These fourteen HbPYLs exhibited very high sequence similarities. According to the sequence alignment with reported AtPYLs. They all contain four identical conserved loops which play important roles in ABA binding and PP2Cs interaction13. The expression pattern of HbPLYs in rubber tree roots, bark, leaves, flowers, and latex indicates that some members clearly show a higher expression level compared with others (Fig. 5). HbPYL6, 7, 914 showed the highest transcription level in latex, whereas HbPYL 25 were not detected in latex (Fig. 5). It was interesting to detect a high expression of several HbPLYs in latex since ABA signalling maybe to participate in latex and rubber production24. Some genes involved in rubber biosynthesis in latex were up-regulated by ABA (Fig. 6), and suggesting latex and rubber production may be regulated by ABA signal.. Although latex and rubber production appears to be polyphyletic in origin, similar mechanisms and underlying enzymes have been identified in all rubber-producing plants investigated thus far33. However, neither the detailed molecular mechanism of rubber biosynthesis nor the precise biological function of latex and natural rubber are completely understood. The transcriptome profiles of laticifers are relatively simple, with a high prevalence of rubber biosynthesis-related genes and high levels of defence-related genes, conferring the roles of laticifers in rubber biosynthesis and defence17. Latex and rubber production should involve several hormone signaling pathways such as ethylene, jasmonate, and ABA3536. It was recently shown that JA and ET act as a signal molecule in rubber production18,19,20,21,22. Interactions of phytohormone signalings in regulating plant development and metabolism have been widely reported37. ABA and ET have antagonistic functions in the control of plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis, ABA activates the JA biosynthetic pathway. High levels of ABA are required to trigger the JA signalling pathway38. JA signalling involving the ABA receptor PYL4 regulates metabolic reprogramming in Arabidopsis and tobacco39. Interaction of the PYL6 ABA receptor with the MYC2 transcription factor links ABA and JA signalling40. In the present study, HbPYL68,12,13 are simultaneously regulated by ABA, JA and ET, suggesting that these genes play a role in the interactions of the ABA, ET and JA signalling pathways. The identification and characterization of HbPYLs should enable us to further understand the role of ABA signal in the rubber tree. It will be of great interest to elucidate the mechanism by which latex and rubber production are regulated in laticifers by ABA, JA, and ET as signalling molecules.. . . Materials and Methods. . Plant Materials and Treatments. Rubber trees (H. brasiliensis cultivar Reyan 7-33-97) budded on seedlings were grown at the experimental farm of the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agriculture Sciences, Hainan, China. The shoots treatments were attached to the rubber tree were treated with 0.5% ethrel (w/v), 0.1% methyl jasmonate (v/v) or 100M abscisic acid, according to Haos method18. Latex samples were collected at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48h after treatment, from 12 shoots at each interval and were stored at 80C until RNA extraction. For latex RNA extraction, latex was dropped directly into liquid nitrogen in an ice kettle. Rubber tree roots, flowers, leaves, and bark were washed with double-distilled H2O and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.. . . Genome-wide identification of the PYL gene family in the rubber tree. Multiple database searches were performed to identify PYLs in the rubber tree. The annotated (predicted) rubber tree genes and proteins were obtained from rubber tree genome data (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession: GenBank: AJJZ01000000). The PYL family genes of Arabidopsis and rice were obtained from Phytozome V10.1 (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#). The PYL cDNA sequences from Arabidopsis and rice were used as queries for searches against the rubber tree genome databases. Default Blast settings were employed, but low-complexity filtering and removal of redundant sequences were performed manually. All hits that were considered candidate sequences were analysed using the NCBI Conserved Domain Search database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) to confirm that each gene was a member of the PYL family. Based on the results of BlastP and BlastN searches in the rubber tree genome database, we obtained information on cDNA sequences and genomic sequences. The molecular weight (MW) and isoelectric point (pI) of each protein sequence were calculated using ExPASy (http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/).. . . Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequence alignments of the HbPYL proteins were performed using ClustalW241. Further processing of the alignment files was conducted using ESPript 3.0 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi)42 with default parameter settings. An unrooted phylogenetic tree of PYL protein sequences was constructed with MEGA 6.043 via the neighbour-joining (NJ) method, and bootstrap analysis was conducted using 1,000 replicates.. . . Gene structure analysis and motif detection in HbPYL family genes. The exon-intron structuresof the HbPYL family genes were determined based on alignment of their coding sequences with thecorresponding genomic sequences, and a diagram was obtained using the Gene Structure Display Server (GSDS 2.0, http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/)44. Motif detection was performed with theMEME program (version 4.11.2, http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme)45.The parameters were as follows: number of repetitions, any; maximum number of motifs, 20; and optimum motif width, between 4 and 40 residues. For other options, the default values were employed.. . . Promoter region analysis of HbPYL genes. To investigate the cis-elements in promoter sequences of HbPYL genes, genomic DNA sequences located at about 7502300bp upstream of the initiation codon (ATG) for all PYL genes were obtained from rubber tree genome data (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession: GenBank: AJJZ01000000). The results were further confirmed by sequencing the PCR products with H. brasiliensis RY 7-33-97 genomic DNA as templates (Supporting file), and primer pairs used were listed in Table S2. Genomic DNA was extracted according to Dellaportas method46. The PlantCARE database (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/) was used to analyze the cis-elements in the promoter regions.. . . RNA extraction and gene expression assay via qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted according to Tangs method47. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Lithuania). Real-time RT-PCR was conducted with the primers listed in Table S2. The rubber tree actin gene (GenBank HQ260674) was employed as an internal control. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green (Takara, China), and melting curve analysis of the amplification products was conducted using a Stratagene Mx3005P Real Time Thermal Cycler (Agilent, America). The real-time RT-PCR conditions were as follows: 5m at 95C for denaturation, followed by 45 cycles of 8s at 95C, 30s at 58C, and 20s at 72C for amplification. Three biological replicates were used per treatment or control.. . . Statistical analysis. Relative RNA expression levels were determined using the 2CT method48. The presented values are the meansSE of three different experiments with three replicated measurements. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare significant differences based on Fishers LSD test at significance levels of P<0.05 and P<0.01.. . . . Additional Information.

PMC5345817	Introduction. In natural ecosystems, plants interact with other organisms that make up the bulk of soil flora and fauna. These interactions determine the microbial diversity of the soil, although not all of these interactions are beneficial for the plants. Rhizobacteria that are found in the root zone (rhizosphere) of plants colonize and interact with plant roots. Although parasitic species of rhizobacteria exist, the term rhizobacteria is ordinarily used only in the context of mutually beneficial or symbiotic associations in which the bacteria help in the promotion of plant growth. That is why these bacteria are also called plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) [1, 2]. Plant growth promotion may come about through direct regulation of phytohormonal activity, increasing root surface area, increasing tolerance to plant diseases [35], rhizosphere engineering, siderophore production, phosphate solubilization, and the production of active chemical signals [6, 7]. These phenomena have been observed in plant-PGPR interactions involving agriculturally important crops such as canola [8], pepper [9], tomato [10], cereals and legumes [11], and forest trees [12, 13]. PGPR have also been used for phytoremediation of contaminated soils [14]. Their growth promoting effects have been observed during a variety of stress conditions such as salinity [2, 15], drought [16, 17], heat stress [18], metal toxicity [19], and others. For these reasons, PGPR are now widely used as biofertilizers, soil amendments, and rhizoremediators [2022]. Although the positive effects of PGPR on plant growth have been well known for decades, the underlying molecular mechanisms of plant growth promotion are poorly understood [23].. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when inoculated to soil with Zn toxicity, improved the growth of wheat plants and their tolerance to oxidative stress as shown by an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) [19]. Pepper plants inoculated with Bacillus licheniformis strain K11 tolerated drought stress more efficiently than un-inoculated plants, which died after 15 days of drought treatment [17]. Another study involving five different species of bacteriaBacillus subtilis EY2, Bacillus atrophaeus EY6, Bacillus spharicus EY30, Staphylococcus kloosii EY37, and Kocuria erythromyxa EY43 found that these PGPR, were able to mitigate the deleterious effects of salt stress in strawberry plants [15]. Heat stress has been a limiting factor to agricultural production throughout the world, especially during dry periods and in areas on and near the equator. In such areas, the interactions of plants with different PGPR play important roles in ameliorating heat stress. For example, heat stress tolerance of wheat plants was increased after treatment with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2CpS1 [18], Bacillus amyloliquefaciens UCMB5110 and Azospirillum brasilense NO40 [24], and Pseudomonas putida AKMP7 [25]. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning heat stress tolerance of plants after PGPR treatment are largely unknown.. PGPR have been shown to promote the production of growth promoting phytohormones [26] such as IAA [27, 28], cytokinin [2931] and gibberellins [3234], inhibit the synthesis of ethylene [28, 35], and regulate endogenous ABA levels in plants [10]. Furthermore, Serratia marcescens strain 90166 has been shown to protect plants against cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in a jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent but SA/NPR1-independent manner, demonstrating the activation of a JA signaling pathway by PGPR [36, 37]. Plant hormones have also been known to act in synergistic and/or antagonistic manner to each other. For example, auxin and cytokinin act antagonistically during biotic stress [38]. Similarly, ABA-cytokinin and SA-cytokinin antagonism has been shown to modulate resistance against plant pathogens in tobacco and rice respectively [39, 40]. Thus, in addition to their plant growth promoting properties, PGPR can also provide protection against plant pathogens. Detailed reviews of the physiological impacts of PGPR and their roles in the mitigation of different abiotic and biotic stresses in plants are available in the literature [2, 4, 68, 22, 36].. The above information shows that PGPR are highly diverse in their plant growth promoting properties and represent a versatile target for use in improving overall crop production. For successful targeted interventions in the soil microbiome, however, it is important to consider soil microbial diversity, as there exist an intricate balance between the different types of microorganisms (and their relative populations) in the rhizosphere. Soil microbial diversity is primarily determined by the extensive communication that takes place between plant roots and associated microorganisms. This communication mostly takes place by means of the different chemical compounds secreted by plant roots and rhizospheric microorganisms, compounds that may serve as nutrients, toxins, or signaling molecules.. PGPR mainly belong to the genera Azospirrillum, Azotobacter, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Serratias [41] and among these, the species of Bacillus and Pseudomonas have perhaps been the most extensively studied. Bacillus aryabhattai (strain B8W22) was initially, isolated from cryotubes used to collect air samples from the Earths stratosphere at an altitude between 27 and 41 km [42], resulting in suggestions of a cosmic origin of this bacterium. Subsequently, the bacterium was isolated from rhizosphere soil in many parts of the world such as South Korea [43], India [44], and Tibet [45]. The plant growth promoting activity of B. aryabhattai was first reported by Lee et al., who showed in 2012 that B. aryabhattai promotes the growth of Xanthium italicum [43]. More recently, it has been shown that zinc solubilizing strains of B. aryabhattai improved the growth of soybean and wheat plants by increasing the mobilization and bio-fortification of zinc [46]. B. aryabhattai strains have also been found useful for several other purposes, such as the biosynthesis of thermostable alkaline phosphatase [47] and the anti-leukemic tumor-inhibiting l-asparaginase enzyme [48, 49], as well as pesticide degradation [44].. Except for the above two reports, however, no information is available on the growth promoting effects of B. aryabhattai and/or its involvement in improving plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we evaluated the plant growth promoting properties of B. aryabhattai strain SRB02 in soybean and rice plants.. . . Materials and methods. . Isolation and identification of B. aryabhattai. Bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere soil (soil attached to the roots of the plants) of a soybean field in the Chungcheong buk-do region of South Korea after prior permission from the owner of the field. For this purpose, 1 g of soil was suspended in 9 ml sterile 0.85% NaCl. The soil suspension was serially diluted up to 106, and then 100 l of the suspension was spread on tryptic soy agar (TSA) medium (MB Cell, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Multiple single colonies were selected and sub-cultured in 5 ml tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium (MB Cell) for 24 h at 30C. The identity of the bacterial isolates was confirmed through 16S rRNA sequencing (Solgent, Daejeon, Korea). The phylogenetic position of the bacterial isolates was determined by blasting the 16S rRNA sequence at NCBI (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).. . . Growth of bacteria. For all the experiments, bacteria were grown either on LB-agar or LB-broth (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated at 30C for 24 h. Bacillus thuringiensis strain ATCC 10792 (hereafter referred to as AY1) was used as a control bacterium of the same genus in subsequent experiments.. . . Soybean growth conditions. Seeds of the soybean cultivar Daewon were germinated on horticultural soil (fungus-free biosoil, Dongbu Farm, Hannong, South Korea) in  filled plastic pots kept in a growth chamber at 28C /25C (day/night), 65% relative humidity and at light intensity of 1000 mol/m/s under long-day conditions (16 h light and 8 h dark).. . . Heat stress treatment and bacterial inoculation. Soybean plants in vegetative stage 3 [(V3) the stage at which the plants are unifoliate and the first three trifoliate leaves are fully developed (https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/fieldcropsipm/soybean-stages.php) were used for the heat stress experiment at 38C/30C (day and night) as suggested by Li et al. [50] and others [51, 52]. For this purpose, soybean plants were grown in pots (10 cm deep and 10 cm wide at the top). Prior to the heat treatment, the soil surface was drenched with 10 ml of LB-grown bacterial culture (1  108 cfu/ml), or with sterilized LB-broth, or with double distilled water for three days. Following a three-day acclimation period, plants were kept at 38C /30C (day/night) for heat stress treatment. Control plants were grown at the optimum temperature conditions mentioned above. Plants were regularly observed and data were recorded. Leaf samples were collected after 0 h, 12 h, and 48 h of heat treatment.. . . Plant growth parameters. Data were recorded on different growth parameters such as shoot length (SL), root length (RL), fresh weight (FW), and dry weight (DW) after 10 days of bacterial inoculation. All data were recorded on 10 plants per replicate and the experiment was repeated 3 times. Data were statistically evaluated with Duncans multiple range test at a 95% level of confidence using SAS 9.1 (www.sas.com).. . . Scanning electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was performed to confirm bacterial colonization of the plant roots, and also to check stomatal movement in the leaves after treatment with SRB02 for analysis of heat stress-related phenotypes. For this purpose, inoculated soybean plants were up-rooted carefully, and the roots were gently washed in sterile distilled water and then freeze dried. Approximately 5 mm2 pieces from leaves and roots of inoculated and control plants were sputter-coated with gold using ion sputtering device (JFC-110E, EC&G, USA) and visualized with an FE-SEM scanning electron microscope (S-4300, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).. . . Quantitative measurement of hormones from bacteria. . Abscisic Acid (ABA) measurement. Bacterial ABA measurement was performed as described by Cohen et al. [53]. For this purpose, 20 ml of extraction solution consisting of 99% EtOAc (ethyl acetate), 1% glacial acetic acid, and 20 ng of the internal standard [()-3,5,5,7,7,7-d6]-ABA, was added to 10 ml of bacterial culture media. The aqueous phase was collected and extracts were evaporated. Dried residues were re-suspended in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), passed to polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) columns with pH adjusted to 3.5 using 6N HCl and again then partitioned three times with EtOAc. Extracts were then combined and evaporated. Dried residues were re-suspended in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and passed through a silica cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) pre-washed with 10 ml of diethyl ether:methanol (3:2 v/v). The extracts were dried again and methylated by adding diazomethane for ABA analysis in a GC/MS-SIM [Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM)] (6890N network GC system and 5973 network mass selective detector; Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and quantified using Lab-Base software (Thermo Quest, Manchester, UK).. . . Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) measurement. Preliminary tests were performed for the presence of IAA in bacterial cultures using Salkowski reagent [5456]. Bacterial IAA measurements were then performed following the method of Park et al. [57]. Briefly, 10ml bacterial cultures were grown at 30C for 2 days. Uniform concentrations of bacterial culture were obtained by measuring the optical density of bacterial cultures at 600 nm and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 m cellulose acetate filter and the pH was adjusted to 2.8 with HCl before adding 40 l of [D5]-IAA as an internal standard. Extracts were then partitioned with 4 ml ethyl acetate. The aqueous phases were combined together and evaporated under a vacuum at 45C. Dried residues were re-suspended using 60% methanol and the pH was adjusted to 8  0.3 using 2N NH4OH, and the suspension was passed through a reverse-phase C18 column. The methanolic fractions were prepared by dissolving the residue in 1 ml of methanol and adding 1.5 ml ethereal diazomethane. The methylated samples were re-dissolved in ethyl acetate before the IAA analysis using GCMS with SIM (6890 N network GC system, and 5973 network mass selective detector; Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA).. . . Gibberellic Acid (GA) measurement. The quantification of GA in the bacterial cultures was carried out according the protocol described by Lee et al. [58]. Bacterial culture filtrates supplemented with (2H2) GA standards were processed for detection, identification and quantification of GAs using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy.. . . . Quantitative measurement of plant endogenous ABA, JA, SA, GA, IAA and cytokinin contents. Freeze-dried plant samples finely ground with a mortar and pestle were used for all the endogenous plant hormone analyses. ABA measurement was performed following the method of Qi et al. [59]. Briefly, 0.1 g plant samples were dissolved in 20 ng of the internal standard [()-3,5,5,7,7,7-d6]-ABA, including isopropanol:acetic acid (95:5) extraction solution, and evaporated. They were dissolved again into 5 ml of 1N NaOH and washed three times with 3 ml of dichloromethane to remove chlorophyll. The aqueous phase was collected, pH was adjusted to 3.5 with 6 N HCl, and the samples were partitioned three times in 10 ml ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and evaporated. Residues were dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and run through a polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP) column. After passing through the column, the pH of the extracts was adjusted to 3.5 with 6N HCl, and the samples were again partitioned three times with EtOAc. The extracts were evaporated and methylated with diazomethane and then GC/MS-SIM analysis was conducted (6890 N network GC system, and the 5973 network mass-selective detector; Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA). For quantification, Lab-Base software was used (ThermoQuest, Manchester, UK).. JA concentrations were measured following the method of Creelman and Mullet [60]. Briefly, 0.1 g plant powder was suspended in an extraction solution of acetone:50 mM citric acid (70:30, v/v) and 20 ng of (9,10-2H2)-9,10-dihydro-JA was added as an internal standard. The suspension was evaporated at room temperature overnight and re-suspended in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, and the pH was adjusted to 2.5. Chlorophyll was removed from the samples using diethyl amino ethyl cellulose (DEAE-cellulose) and then partitioned using chloroform. Samples were then filtered through Na2SO4 and evaporated. Extracts were re-dissolved in 5 ml of diethyl ether three times then purified by passing them through a solid phase extraction cartridge (500 mg of sorbent, amino propyl). The cartridges were washed with 5 ml of chloromethane and 2-propanol solution (2:1, v/v) three times. JA was then eluted three times with 2 ml of diethyl ether and acetic acid solution (98:2, v/v) before methylation. The extracts were then analyzed by GC-MS as described above.. Salicylic acid (SA) in SRB02-treated soybean plants was extracted as described by Seskar et al. [61]. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a C18 reverse phase column (HP Hypersil ODS, particle size 5 mm, pore size 120 ; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and a Shimadzu RF-10AZL (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a fluorescence detector with excitation and emission set at 305 nm and 365 nm, respectively. Flow rate was maintained at 1.0 ml/min. For plant endogenous GA measurement, samples were lyophilized and ground into fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Afterwards, samples were processed as described above for bacterial GA measurements.. Plant IAA and cytokinin (Trans-Zeatin) measurements were performed as described by [62] and [63] with minor modifications using Liquid Chromatography Electrospray-Ionization Quadrupole Time-of-flight (LC-ESI-QTOF) Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Briefly, 200 mg of freeze dried leaf samples from treated and un-treated control plants were finely ground and 2 ml of extraction buffer [2-propanol: H2O: concentrated HCl (2:1:0.002, vol/vol/vol)] was added and incubated at 4C on a shaker for 30 min. Then 2 ml of dichloromethane was added to each sample and incubated at 4C on a shaker for 30 min before centrifugation at 13,000g for 5 min at 4C. The lower phase was then transferred to another tube and concentrated using nitrogen evaporation and re-dissolved in 0.1 ml methanol. Finally 10 l of the resulting solution was analyzed in a XEVO G2-S QTOF Spectrometer (Waters, USA) connected with a UPLC system (Waters, USA) using Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 M (2.1 x 100 mm) column. All the experiments were repeated at least three times.. Quantitative measurements for all plant and bacterial hormones were performed three times. Data were subjected for analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SigmaPlot (10.0). Mean values were compared using Duncans Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at 95% level of significance.. . . Stress media tests. B. aryabhattai SRB02 were tested for tolerance to multiple oxidative and nitrosative stresses. For this purpose, SRB02 were grown on oxidative and nitrosative stress media. Oxidative stress was given by supplementing LB agar media with 0.75 M, 1 M, 1.5 M and 2 M methyl viologen (MV) and 50 M, 100 M, 200 M and 500 M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), while nitrosative stress was given by supplementing LB agar media with 4 mM, 4.5 mM, 5 mM and 6 mM S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and 3.5 mM, 4 mM, and 5 mM S-nitrocysteine (CysNO). Pilot experiments were first conducted to adjust the above optimum concentrations. B. thuringiensis strain AY1 was used as a control.. . . SOD-like activity test. The results of the stress media showed that SRB02 tolerated high oxidative stress given by both MV (donor of the superoxide O2 radical) and H2O2. This prompted us to investigate the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities of these bacteria. An SOD activity test was performed following established procedures [64, 65] with minor modifications. For this purpose, 3 ml of 50 mM Tris-cacodylic acid buffer (TCB, pH 8.2) was added to 2 ml LB bacterial cultures (O.D 600nm = 0.2) and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. Next, 950 l of the supernatant was mixed with 50 l of 10 mM pyrogallol (A). Bacterial supernatant with TCB (B), TCB with pyrogallol (C), and sterilized LB broth with pyrogallol, were used as comparative controls. The experiment was repeated three times and data were analyzed for significant differences through Students T-test at 95% level of significance using Microsoft Excel.. Pyrogallol (1,2,3-benzenetriol) is known for its high rate of autoxidation, especially at higher pH values, and it has been used for separation of oxygen from other gases. SOD enzyme rapidly dismutases univalent reduced oxygen, also called the superoxide anion radical (O2). SOD reduces the autoxidation of pyrogallol by about 99% in the presence of the O2 anion radical [66]. Hence, the extent of SOD activity can be estimated from the ability of the SOD enzyme to inhibit the autoxidation of pyrogallol which is measured in terms of changes in the absorbance (A) at a wavelength of 420 nm overtime at 25C. We measured this change in absorbance after 2 min, 5 min, and 10 min, and we calculated SOD-like activity by the following formula [65].. . . . . . S. O. D. . a. c. t. i. v. i. t. y. . .

Catalase activity was tested using an Amplex Red Catalase Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. The kit provides an ultrasensitive but, simple method for measuring catalase activity based on a competition assay between catalase enzyme and the Amplex Red reagent. Catalase first reacts with H2O2 producing H2O and O2. The Amplex Red then reacts with any remaining H2O2 in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), producing a fluorescent oxidation product, resorufin. Increased production of catalase enzyme(s) overtime reduces the resorufin signal. Overnight bacterial cultures (O.D 600 = 0.2) were centrifuged and the pellets were lysed in 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4).. The experiment was performed in a 96-well plate by adding 25 l each of SRB02 and AY1 cell lysates, catalase standard curve samples, and 40 M H2O2. Following the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase, 50 M Amplex Red reagent and 0.2 U/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were added. Fluorescence was measured using a Multiskan GO microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) at 590 nm. The experiment was repeated three times and data were analyzed for significant differences through Students T-test at 95% level of significance using Microsoft Excel.. . . Gene expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and subsequent ethanol precipitation before cDNA synthesis. One microgram of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using a DiaStarTM RT Kit (Solgent, Daejeon, South Korea). Gene expression was analyzed by two-step quantitative real time PCR using a QuantiSpeed SYBR Green Kit (PhileKorea, Seoul, South Korea) in an Eco real-time PCR machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for 40 cycles. Each reaction contained 10 l master mix, 1 l each of 10 pmol/l primers (S1 Table), and 1 l of cDNA, with final volume adjusted to 20 l using nuclease free water. The PCR reaction was performed with an initial denaturation step at 95C for 2 min and subsequent denaturation steps at 95C for 10 s followed by annealing and extension at 60C for 30 s for 40 cycles.. . . . Results. . B aryabhattai SRB02 as a plant growth promoting bacterium. As described above, we isolated bacteria from the rhizosphere soil of a soybean field in the Chungcheong buk-do region of South Korea. After obtaining pure cultures, the target bacterium was identified through 16S rRNA sequencing. The phylogenetic position of the bacterial isolate was determined by blasting the 16S rRNA sequence on NCBI (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Phylogenetic analysis showed 100% similarity of the 16S rRNA sequence of our target bacterium to B. aryabhattai strain SRB02 (S1 Fig) first reported by Kang et al. from South Korea (NCBI accession No. KP860638.1) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/803432357?report=genbank&log$=nuclalign&blast_rank=1&RID=RW73JGVC01R).. The overall analyses performed in this study showed that B. aryabhattai strain SRB02 (hereafter referred to as SRB02) significantly promoted the growth of soybean and rice. Scanning electron microscopy showed that SRB02 successfully colonized the roots of soil-grown soybean plants within 2 days of inoculation (Fig 1C) and resulted in significantly greater shoot length, leaf size, and node number of both soybean (Fig 1A and 1B) than those observed for control treatments, indicating that SRB02 is a plant growth promoting bacterium. In soybean plants in particular, the growth promoting effect was observed in plants grown under optimum as well as under high temperature conditions, indicating that SRB02 ameliorates heat stress in soybean.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0173203.g001. Fig 1. . Bacillus aryabhattai SRB02 as a plant growth promoting rhizobacterium.. Soil-grown soybean plants in vegetative stage 3 (V3) were inoculated (by soil drenching) with LB-grown bacterial culture (1  108 cfu/ml), or with sterilized LB broth or with double distilled water for 3 days and kept at 38C/30C (day/night) for the heat stress treatment, following a 3-day acclimation period (A). SRB02 promoted the growth of soybean plants under all temperature regimes and significantly increased the shoot length of soybean plants as well as leaf length, leaf width and number of nodes (B) after successful colonization of roots within 2 days of inoculation (C). Each data point in panel B represents the mean of at least three replicates. Error bars represent standard deviations. Bars with different letters are significantly different from each other at P  0.05.. . . . . . B. aryabhattai SRB02 regulates the production of growth hormones in plants. SRB02-mediated growth promotion of soybean and rice plants prompted us to investigate whether SRB02 can produce growth hormones and/or affect the regulation of endogenous phytohormones. For this purpose, we measured various phytohormones in bacterial cultures as well as in plants treated with SRB02.. . . SRB02 produces ABA and helps plants maintain ABA levels during heat stress. Plants treated with SRB02 showed a sustained production of ABA from 12 h to 48 h after inoculation under both temperature regimes (Fig 2A and 2B). Similar results were obtained using qRT-PCR analysis of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis: GmZEP (Glyma01g39310), GmNCED (Glyma05g27250), and ABA responsive gene GmRD20A (Glyma03g41030). Very similar transcript levels were recorded for these genes in soybean plants treated with SRB02 12 h to 48 h after inoculation, especially in plants grown at high temperature (Fig 2C2H).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0173203.g002. Fig 2. . Bacillus aryabhattai SRB02 produces ABA and regulates its levels in plants.. Plants treated with B. aryabhattai SRB02 produced constant levels of ABA under normal temperature conditions (A) as well as under heat stress (B). These results are consistent with the very similar transcript accumulation of the ABA-related genes ZEP (C, D), NCED (E, F), and RD20A (G, H) from 12 h to 48 h of SRB02 treatment under both temperature regimes. Plants treated with SRB02 were more tolerant of heat stress and remained green, while the leaves of control plants showed chlorotic symptoms (I). SRB02 produced a significantly higher amount of ABA than did AY1 (J). Each data point represents the mean of at least three replicates. Error bars represent standard deviations. Bars with different letters are significantly different from each other at P  0.05.. . . . Interestingly, we observed medium to severe leaf chlorosis in control soybean plants following heat stress treatment (Fig 2I), and increased expression of ABA biosynthesis genes (Fig 2D, 2F and 2H). On the other hand, in SRB02-treated plants, which produced normal levels of ABA after 12 h to 24 h after inoculation, no chlorosis was observed (Fig 2I). Analysis of bacterial cultures showed that SRB02 produced up to 2 ng/ml ABA in culture (Fig 2J). ABA-mediated drought stress tolerance through stomatal closure is well known and as we expected, the stomata of plants treated with SRB02 were almost closed under high day/night temperatures of 38C/30C compared to those of control plants (S2 Fig). Analysis of SRB02 cultures showed at least 20-fold higher ABA accumulation than that of the control bacterium B. thuringiensis strain AY1 (Fig 2J).. . . SRB02 produces IAA and modulates auxin signaling in soybean plants. SRB02-treated soybean plants showed low IAA levels compared to untreated control plants at all the time points (Fig 3A). SRB02-mediated low IAA levels were observed in plants grown at both normal and high temperature conditions. Furthermore, in plants grown under heat stress conditions significant quantity of IAA could only be detected up to 12 h after SRB02 treatment (Fig 3B). Quantitative real time PCR analysis of plants grown under heat stress showed significantly higher accumulation of two genes involved in auxin signaling: GmIAA16 (Glyma02g16071) and GmIAA9 (Glyma01g02350) (Fig 3C & 3D) which both encode the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins [67, 68] which explains low accumulation of IAA in SRB02-treated plants. Analysis of SRB02 broth cultures with van UrkSalkowski reagent indicated high concentrations of auxin derivatives (Inset, Fig 3E). Salkowski reagent is a chromogenic reagent having high sensitivity and specificity to approximately 80 different indoles, and it gives a pinkish to orange color upon reaction. Further chromatographic analyses of SRB02 and AY1 cultures using GC-MS showed a more than 20-fold increase in IAA in SRB cultures over that in AY1 cultures (Fig 3E).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0173203.g003. Fig 3. . Bacillus aryabhattai SRB02 produces IAA and transcriptionally regulates its production in plants.. Soybean plants treated with SRB02 accumulated lower quantity of IAA under optimum (A) and heat stress conditions (B). SRB02-treated plants showed significantly higher expression of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor genes IAA9 (C) and IAA16 (D) genes. Preliminary tests with Salkowski reagent showed the production of IAA in SRB02 culture (Inset E). GC-MS analysis showed that SRB02 produced significantly higher amounts of IAA than did AY1 (E). Error bars represent standard deviations. Each data point represents the mean of at least three replications. Bars with different letters are significantly different from each other at P  0.05.. . . . . . SRB02 modulates JA biosynthesis and cross-talk with SA in soybean. Analysis of soybean plants revealed a rapid increase in the biosynthesis of JA within 12 h of inoculation and continuing up to 48 h (Fig 4A). However, under heat stress conditions, JA levels decreased drastically after 12 h of SRB02 treatment (Fig 4B), though the concentration of JA in SRB02-treated plants was still higher than in the control plants. Endogenous JA levels in plants decrease significantly within the first 12 h of heat stress treatment accompanied by the suppression of genes involved in JA biosynthesis [69]. As a result of the marked increase in JA levels caused by SRB02 in soybean plants grown under optimum temperature conditions, we expected JA levels to at least remain constant after heat treatment in SRB02-treated plants. However, to our surprise, JA levels declined significantly after 12 h of inoculation with SRB02 under heat stress indicating that SRB02-mediated activation of the JA pathway is dependent upon growth conditions. Several studies have reported PGPR-mediated protection of plants through the activation of ISR, a defense pathway regulated by JA. Our results indicated that following SRB02-mediated increase in JA content, the SA levels remained almost constant at all the time points under study (Fig 4C and 4D), indicating that root colonization by SRB02 does not activate an SA dependent defense response.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0173203.g004. Fig 4. . Bacillus aryabhattai SRB02 promotes the production of jasmonic acid in plants.. SRB02-treated soybean plants produced significantly higher quantities of jasmonic acid under optimum temperature conditions at all the time points studied (A). Though JA accumulation gradually declined from 12 h to 48 h after inoculation with SRB02 under heat stress, JA content was significantly higher in SRB02-treated plants than in un-treated control plants for up to 12 h after inoculation (B). SRB02-treated soybean plants showed significantly less SA accumulation after 12, 24 and 48 h of inoculation both at optimal temperature (C) and high temperature conditions (D). Error bars represent standard deviations. Each data point represents the mean of at least three replications. Bars with different letters are significantly different from each other at P  0.05.. . . . . . SRB02 produces GAs and regulates GA biosynthesis in soybean. Analysis of SRB02-treated soybean plants grown under normal temperature conditions did not show a significant increase in the concentration of most GAs except for GA4 and GA7 (Fig 5A). However, SRB02-treated plants grown under heat stress showed markedly greater production of several GA derivatives than that in control plants (Fig 5B). SRB02 produced the GA derivatives GA1, GA3, GA4, GA7, GA8, GA9, GA20, GA24, GA34, and GA53, with the highest quantities being for GA4 and GA20, followed by GA7, GA24, and GA3 (Fig 5C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0173203.g005. Fig 5. . Bacillus aryabhattai SRB02 produces gibberellins and regulates their production in soybean.. GC-MS analysis of plants SRB02-treated plants grown under normal temperature conditions did not show significant variation in the accumulation of different GA derivatives except for GA4 and GA7 (A). Under high temperature conditions, significantly higher quantities of GA4, GA7 and GA12 were recorded (B). Analysis of bacterial cultures revealed significant quantities of several GA derivatives (C). Error bars represent standard deviations. Each data point represents the mean of at least three replications. Bars with different letters are significantly different from each other at P  0.05.. . . . . . SRB02 produces cytokinin and regulates cytokinin homeostasis in soybean. As described earlier, the antagonistic behavior of auxin and cytokinin is well known. The SRB02 mediated perturbation of auxin levels as well as of the auxin related transcriptional machinery in soybean plants under normal and heat stress conditions tempted us to investigate cytokinin levels in plants following SRB02 application. Results showed a significant and rapid reduction in cytokinin levels following SRB02 treatment under both temperature regimes. The least quantity of cytokinin was recorded after 12 h of SRB02 treatment whereas no cytokinin could be detected later in the plants treated with SRB02 whether grown under optimum temperature conditions or under heat stress (Fig 6A1 & 6B1, respectively). Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed a marked increase in the transcript accumulation of two genes GMCKX04 and GmCKX07 in SRB02-treated plants grown under normal temperature (Fig 6A2 & 6A3) and high temperature conditions (Fig 6B2 & 6B3). The CKX is a multi-gene family present throughout the plant kingdom encoding cytokinin dehydrogenase proteins that irreversibly degrade the phytohormone cytokinin in plants [70, 71]. LC-ESI-Q-TOF analysis showed that SRB02 produced about 1.5 ng/ml cytokinin in liquid culture (Fig 6C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0173203.g006. Fig 6. . Bacillus aryabhattai SRB02 produces cytokinin and regulates cytokinin homeostasis in soybean.. Results showed a significant and rapid reduction in cytokinin levels of SRB02-treated soybean plants grown under normal temperature conditions after 12 h of inoculation (A1) potentiated by significantly higher transcript accumulation of the cytokinin-dehydrogenase genes GmCKX04 (A2) and GmCKX07 (A3). Cytokinin levels also decreased after treatment of soybean plants with SRB02 under heat stress conditions (B1) with a concomitant increase in the expression of GmCKX04 (B2) and GmCKX07 (B3) genes. LC-ESI-QTOF analysis showed that SRB02 produced about 1.5 ng/ml cytokinin in liquid culture (C) compared to AY1 which did not produce any cytokinin. Each data point represents the mean of at least three replicates. Error bars indicate standard deviation. Bars with different letters are significantly different from each other at P  0.05.. . . . . . B. aryabhattai tolerates high oxidative and nitrosative stress. Attachment, entry, or colonization of plant roots or any of the above-ground parts of a plant by a pathogen usually triggers a defense response. Whether the defense response is successful or not is the outcome of highly complex plant-pathogen interactions. Plant defense responses are most often characterized by a change in the cellular redox state with an increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Successful SRB02 root colonization and growth promotion of soybean by regulation of phytohormone homeostasis prompted us to investigate the response of these bacteria to oxidative and nitrosative stresses. For this purpose, we grew B. aryabhattai SRB02 cultures on LB medium containing various concentrations of MV and H2O2 (for oxidative stress) and the nitric oxide donors GSNO and CysNO (for nitrosative stress). Interestingly, SRB02 was able to tolerate the high oxidative and nitrosative stresses induced by all the treatments better than AY1. SRB02 grew efficiently on LB-agar plates containing up to 2 M MV and 200 M H2O2. Analysis of SRB02 cultures indicated significantly higher SOD (Fig 7A and 7B) and CAT activities than observed for AY1 (Fig 7C and 7D), indicating the presence of highly active and efficient antioxidant machinery in SRB02. Similarly, SRB02 also grew much better on GSNO and CysNO plates (Fig 7E and 7F).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0173203.g007. Fig 7. . Bacillus aryabhattai SRB02 tolerates high oxidative stress and nitrosative stress.. SRB02 was found to be significantly more tolerant of oxidative stress provoked by up to 2 M MV than was AY1 (A), potentiated by significantly higher SOD activity (B). SRB02 was also significantly more resistant to H2O2 than was AY1 (C) due to significantly high catalase activity (D). SRB02 was significantly more tolerant of nitrosative stress induced by various concentrations of the NO donor GSNO (E) and CysNO (F) than AY1. Error bars represent standard deviations. Each data point represents the mean of at least three replications. Bars with asterisk are significantly different (Students t-test) from each other at P  0.05.. . . . . . . Discussion. The use of PGPR as microbial inoculants is becoming a widely accepted practice in intensive agriculture, especially in the developed countries [72]. For this purpose, aggressive colonization of plant roots is one of the key criteria used for selection of efficient PGPR. Root colonization by various PGPR has been reported to occur in one to a few weeks, with bacterial populations reaching a maximum point within 60 days [72]. The successful soybean root colonization by SRB02 within 2 days of inoculation was surprisingly fast. This rapid root colonization may well be aided by the response of SRB02 to exudates from soybean roots. Another plant growth promoting bacterium from the genus Bacillus that responds to root exudates is B. amyloliquefaciens. Strain NJN-6 of this bacterium has been shown to respond to organic acids from root exudates of banana [73]. PGPR-mediated growth promotion is typically associated with enhanced production of growth-related phytohormones such as auxin, ABA, cytokinin, GA, and others though, it is now generally agreed that the phytohormones produced by PGPR may not be of any physiological importance to these bacteria per se but are instead produced by them as secondary metabolites in order to establish a better association with their host plants.. Since ABA and GA biosynthesis follow the same pathway in plastids through the non-mevlonate or methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) biosynthetic route of terpenes [74], one feasible hypothesis is that PGPR can produce both ABA and GA simultaneously and possibly enhance the ABA and GA levels of plant hosts. Adaptive responses of plants to heat stress usually include an increase in endogenous ABA levels [75]. The effect of different concentrations of ABA on heat stress tolerance of different plants has been extensively studied [76, 77]. However, continuous production of high ABA levels is toxic to plants and leads to leaf chlorosis/necrosis [7880]. Interestingly, we observed medium to severe leaf chlorosis in control soybean plants following heat stress treatment (Fig 2I), However, this may also be the effect of ABA accumulation or ABA induced ethylene production following heat stress treatment [81, 82]. The B. aryabhattai strain SRB02 isolated in this study not only produced ABA and GA but also significantly enhanced the levels of these phytohormones in soybean plants.. Abscisic acid positively regulates drought stress tolerance in plants [83]. ABA-mediated drought stress tolerance through stomatal closure is well known [84]. Since different types of stresses induce the production of ABA in plants, it is now widely regarded as a stress hormone and its physiological impact and its production under different basal and induced conditions has been described [8486]. SRB02-mediated heat stress tolerance of soybean plants potentiated through sustained production of ABA and expression of related genes compelled us to investigate stomatal movement in soybean plants under heat stress. As expected, the stomata of plants treated with SRB02 were almost closed under high day/night temperatures of 38C/30C compared to those of control plants (S2 Fig). These results are similar to the findings of other studies that reported the production of ABA by different PGPR, as well as enhancement of the levels of ABA and other phytohormones in host plants. In 2001 and 2007, Cohen et al. demonstrated that Azospirillum lipoferum and A. brasilense Sp. 245 not only produce ABA but they also enhance ABA levels in maize and Arabidopsis plants 2-fold [53, 87, 88]. By comparison, the B. aryabhattai strain SRB02 identified in this study produced up to 2 ng/ml ABA and enhanced ABA levels of soybean plants more than 4-fold especially at the earlier time points of 12 h post inoculation.. It appears that plants synthesize ABA through cleavage of carotenes such as neoxanthin [89], while lower organisms such as fungi produce it directly from farnesyl pyrophosphate [90]. The ABA biosynthetic pathway in bacteria is unknown, however. PGPR-mediated growth regulation is partly governed by the regulation of auxin biosynthesis. Although a very large proportion (almost 80%) of bacteria colonizing the rhizosphere have been identified as positive for IAA production, an equally large percentage of these are gram-negative, a common characteristic of phyto-pathogenic bacteria. A limited number of gram-positive soil-living bacteria have been reported to produce IAA, e.g., B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens, and the first of these is also a well-established bio-control agent [91]. B. aryabhattai strain SRB02 isolated in this study produced up to 5.8 g/ml IAA in culture. However, to our surprise, SRB02 inoculation resulted in a significant decrease in the IAA content of soybean plants grown under normal as well as heat stress conditions. Furthermore, after 48 h of SRB02 inoculation, we could not detected any IAA in soybean plants grown under optimum temperature conditions.. Modulation in phytohormone production in response to different biotic and abiotic stresses is well known. Key phytohormones such as auxin and cytokinin have been shown to decrease under heat stress [9294]. Several plant growth promoting rhizobacterial species not only produce auxins per se but also regulate IAA biosynthesis in their respective host plants. At least 20 different strains of A. brasilense and A. lipoferum have been shown to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-ethanol, indole-3-methanol, and indole-3-lactic acid, and several of these strains also promoted IAA biosynthesis in maize seedlings [95]. Un-like ABA, the biosynthesis of IAA in bacteria is relatively well known, with tryptophan being the major precursor for IAA production, and with tryptophan-deficient mutants that lack trp gene being unable to produce IAA [28]. As such, multiple pathways have been suggested for the synthesis of IAA in bacteria, involving indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA), indole-3-acetamide (IAM), and indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) as important intermediates, although all use tryptophan as a precursor [96, 97]. Several PGPR have been shown to produce auxin in culture and interfere with auxin biosynthesis in plants. PGPR produce IAA from tryptophan which is present in plant roots in varying concentrations depending upon plant genotype [98]. It is also important to mention that the function of auxin in plants is concentration dependent i.e. low concentrations of IAA simulates elongation of the primary root, whereas high levels of IAA stimulate the formation of lateral roots and root hairs [99, 100]. SRB02-treated soybean plants produced more secondary roots under both temperature regimes compared to un-treated control plants (S3 Fig). This indicates that the significantly higher quantity of IAA produced by SRB02 once transported into the plant system, exerted an inhibitory effect on auxin biosynthesis and impede primary root formation. Furthermore, this higher quantity of IAA cued a counter-response measure in plant cells switching off the endogenous auxin-production machinery at transcriptional level as shown by a significant increase in the expression of transcriptional repressor genes IAA9 and IAA16. During root colonization, such PGPR also produce secondary metabolites and signaling molecules such as 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and nitric oxide (NO) [101, 102]. NO has been shown to regulate auxin biosynthesis in plants [103] as well as PGPR-mediated auxin production in plants [102]. The extremely resistant nature of SRB02 to nitrosative and oxidative stress may correlate with SRB02-mediated homeostasis of IAA in soybean plants. IAA and ABA have been shown to act antagonistically in planta [104106]. SRB02-mediated reduction of IAA in soybean plants may just be the antagonistic outcome of the ABA-stabilizing effect of SRB02 in these plants. Astonishingly, the production of IAA by PGPR may not always prove beneficial for plants. For example, IAA production by Pseudomonas putida favors root colonization of Azospirillum brasilense, ultimately promoting plant growth [107], but IAA production has also been found necessary for pathogenesis [108, 109]. This suggests that IAA and other plant hormones not only control plant development but can also act as signaling molecules. Furthermore, as a result of the constant interaction between plants and pathogens during the course of evolution, phyto-pathogens have learned to produce and use these signaling molecules to their advantage while communicating with other microorganisms and/or with host plants.. PGPR have been shown to protect plants against plant pathogens through a pathway that is SA and NPR1-independent but JA dependent [37]. The PGPR S. marcescens strain 90166 induced the expression of PDF1.2::GUS in Arabidopsis Col-0 and npr1-1 mutant backgrounds after 3 days of inoculation but did not induce PR1 expression. It also protected SA-deficient nahG plants against infection by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) [37], indicating that PGPR play an important role in induced systemic resistance (ISR). Even though strain 90166 has been shown to produce SA it was not the primary determinant responsible for activating ISR in cucumber and tobacco against bacterial and fungal pathogens [110, 111], since the SA-negative S. marcescens strain 90-166-1441 also induced resistance against bacterial pathogens in tobacco wild type and nahG mutant lines [110] and in Arabidopsis nahG plants [37], indicating that activation of plant defense responses by some PGPR can occur only through the activation of the JA pathway but not the SA pathway. On the other hand, some PGPR may also induce systemic acquired resistance (SAR) which requires the activation of the SA pathway [112]. The B. aryabhattai SRB02 strain isolated in this study significantly enhanced JA production in soybean plants. Endogenous JA levels in plants decrease significantly within the first 12 h of heat stress treatment accompanied by the suppression of genes involved in JA biosynthesis [69]. As a result of the marked increase in JA levels caused by SRB02 in soybean plants grown under optimum temperature conditions, we expected JA levels to at least remain constant after heat treatment in SRB02-treated plants. However, to our surprise, JA levels declined significantly after 12 h of inoculation with SRB02 under heat stress indicating that SRB02-mediated activation of the JA pathway is dependent upon growth conditions.. Several PGPR-plant interactions have been shown to involve cytokinin production [29, 30, 113, 114]. It appears that PGPR-produced cytokinin mediated growth promotion in plants requires the function of cytokinin receptors CRE1, AHK2 and AHK3, and RPN12 a gene involved in cytokinin signaling as PGPR-mediated growth promotion was reduced in AHK2-2 single and double mutant combinations and in RPN12, whereas the triple mutant CRE1-12/AHK2-2/AHK3-3 was insensitive to PGPR inoculation [30]. In a recently published study, Grosskinsky et al. demonstrated the role of microbial cytokinin production in plant defense against the hemi-biotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae [115]. They showed that the resistance of Arabidopsis plants to bacterial infection was potentiated by the cytokinin produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens strain G20-18 as cytokinin deficient loss-of-function G20-18 mutants exhibited impaired biocontrol. Furthermore, biocontrol activity was restored after functional complementation of these strains with cytokinin biosynthetic genes. However, P. fluorescenceproduced cytokinin mediated biocontrol was found to be SA-dependent and it also required active cytokinin perception as shown by Arabidopsis mutant analysis. This shows the potential of such PGPR for incorporation into integrated plant protection programs. Though the SRB02 bacterial strain isolated in this study produce cytokinin in culture, significant reduction in cytokinin levels was observed in SRB02-treated plants grown under both temperature regimes with a concomitant increase in the expression of cytokinin dehydrogenase genes (GmCKX04 and GmCKX07) which degrade cytokinin. Furthermore, antagonistic roles of ABA and cytokinin have been demonstrated during abiotic stresses [116]. Thus, low cytokinin levels in SRB02-treated plants may be due to the negative effects of increase ABA levels in these plants.. Different PGPR such as Bacillus pumilus and B. licheniformis produce gibberellins such as GA1, GA3, GA4, and GA20, and they suppress GA-deficient phenotypes of alder seedlings [32]. Earlier studies also described GA production by different PGPR, such as Rhizobium phaseoli [117], Azospirillum lipoferum [118], A. brasilense [119], and others. According to these studies, PGPR cultures contain nanogram amounts of GA1, GA3, GA4, GA9, GA20, and other GA derivatives. PGPR, when applied to plant roots, increase endogenous GA levels in maize [120]. Promicromonospora sp. SE188 produced GA1, GA4, GA9, GA12, GA19, GA20, GA24, GA34, and GA53 in culture and significantly enhanced the production of GA12, GA24, GA9, GA4, and GA34 in tomato plants [121]. In this study, we did not observe a direct linear or inverse relationship between the phytohormone profiles of SRB02 and SRB02-treated plant, whether grown under normal temperature or high temperature conditions. For example various GAs measured from SRB02 cultures and SRB02-treated soybean plants did not correlate with each other. Furthermore, various GA derivatives differ in their biological activity, hence further increasing the complexity and significance of PGPR-host plant interaction.. Methyl viologen is a superoxide radical (O2) donor. In plants, superoxide radicals and/or other ROS are generated in response to different stresses. These highly reactive and toxic molecules which are mainly produced in the mitochondria and chloroplasts can damage cellular proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and DNA, resulting in oxidative stress [122]. On the other hand, plants also possess very efficient enzymatic antioxidant defense machinery. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) provides protection against superoxide radicals, while catalase enzymes (CAT) degrade H2O2. Enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and others, are also important components of plants antioxidant machinery. Analysis of SRB02 cultures indicated significantly higher SOD and CAT activities than those observed in AY1 cultures, indicating the presence of highly active and efficient antioxidant machinery in SRB02. Similarly, SRB02 also grew much better on GSNO and CysNO plates. These results parallel the findings of other studies that report oxidative and nitrosative stress tolerant PGPR [19, 123]. However, the question of how PGPR tolerate high oxidative and nitrosative stresses remains largely unanswered. Storz et al. in 1999 reviewed the mechanisms by which several rhizospheric and other bacteria tolerate high oxidative stress [124]. More recently, Shen et al. (2013), through comparative genomic analysis of four PGPR in the genus Pseudomonas, showed the presence of ROS-detoxifying enzymes, including 11 peroxidases, 5 catalases, 2 superoxide dismutases, and 19 glutathione S-transferases [123]. Functional components such as the two-component regulator GacS/GacA [125], and SoxR and OxyR [126], are key regulators of oxidative stress tolerance in PGPR. Furthermore, exopolysaccharides and polyhydroxyalkanoates have also been shown to play important roles in oxidative stress tolerance in PGPR [127] and other bacteria [128]. Over-expression of flavodoxin in E. coli, the nitrogen fixing bacterium Ensifer meliloti, and the PGPR Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Aur6 enhanced the tolerance of these bacteria to oxidative stress provoked by H2O2 and paraquat or atrazine; on solid medium which is also in agreement with the findings of this study.. Similarly, microbial enzymes responsible for providing resistance to nitrosative stress have been identified through functional genetics analyses of several non-PGPR bacteria [129131]. One such enzyme that is highly conserved from bacteria to humans is S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) [131], which controls the global levels of S-nitrosothiols (SNO) through the process of denitrosylation [132]. Other enzymes such as flavorubredoxin nitric oxide reductase and flavohemoglobin denitrosylase play important roles in direct consumption of NO [130, 133], whereas the bacterial AhpC peroxiredoxin proteins are responsible for direct consumption of peroxynitrite. Nitrosative stress tolerance has been studied extensively in bacterial-mammalian host systems, but very little information is available about this phenomenon in PGPR. Information related to the fate of NO in the interactions of plants with rhizospheric bacteria is extremely important as several nitrifying and de-nitrifying bacteria play important roles in nitrogen and NO cycles.. The use of PGPR in agriculture is gaining importance and is becoming a permanent part of cropping systems throughout the world. It is not only environment-friendly but also cost-effective, reliable, and durable. The use of gram-positive PGPR such as the B. aryabhattai strain SRB02 identified in this study is of special importance as these bacteria have the ability to form resistant endospores. Once applied and established in a field they can survive harsh conditions for a significant period of time. Our results show that B. aryabhattai strain SRB02 rapidly colonizes the roots of host plants and promotes their growth by regulating the homeostasis of several phytohormones, and it is also highly resistant to oxidative and nitrosative stresses, making it a valuable organism for incorporation into biofertilizers and other soil amendments for the improvement of crop productivity. Further studies are required to determine the molecular mechanisms underpinning oxidative and nitrosative stress tolerance in SRB02 and to exploit this information for engineering PGPR in order to further increase their plant growth promoting abilities.. . .

PMC5362598	Introduction. Silicon (Si) is considered non-essential (or quasi-essential, Epstein and Bloom, 2005) for plant growth and development. Plants develop well in its absence, although in some cases, e.g., the silicifier horsetail and rice, the absence of Si triggers increased susceptibility to fungal infection (Datnoff and Rodrigues, 2005; Law and Exley, 2011). When supplied to the growth medium (as silicic acid, vide infra), plant vigor and resistance to (a)biotic stresses increase (Azeem et al., 2015; Coskun et al., 2016; Guerriero et al., 2016a). Si is taken up by plants as silicic acid Si(OH)4 via aquaporin type channels (Nod26-like intrinsic proteins, NIPs) (Ma et al., 2006; Grgoire et al., 2012; Deshmukh et al., 2013). A specific 108 amino acid spacing between the conserved NPA domains determines Si(OH)4 permeability (Deshmukh et al., 2015). Plants are classified into accumulators, excluders and intermediate type (Mitani and Ma, 2005), depending on the amount of biogenic silica found in their tissues. Among the accumulators are Equisetales, Cyperales and Poales: in Graminae, rice is the highest silicifier where Si (in the form of biogenic silica, vide infra) accounts for up to 10% of the shoot dry weight (Ma et al., 2002). Tomato is among the excluders, while Urtica dioica (i.e., nettle) is an intermediate type (Trembath-Reichert et al., 2015).. In (some) plants the provision of Si(OH)4 has a latent effect in the absence of an external stimulus (Fauteux et al., 2005, 2006). This has been observed in the Arabidopsis-powdery mildew pathosystem (Fauteux et al., 2006). It should, however, be noted that in rice, Si(OH)4 supplementation does trigger major changes, as it induces the upregulation and downregulation of 35 and 121 transcription factors respectively (Van Bockhaven et al., 2012). This difference may be in part due to the different cell wall types (Yokoyama and Nishitani, 2004) and to the structural importance of Si in type II cell walls (i.e., cell walls characterized by the presence of more phenylpropanoids as compared to type I cell walls in dicots).. By precipitating as SiO2 and being incorporated into biological structures (e.g., the cell wall, vide infra), Si exerts its protective action via the formation of a physical barrier. However, this passive role is too simplistic and does not explain why plants supplemented with Si are better suited to face exogenous stresses. Compelling evidence in the literature shows that specific cell wall components trigger SiO2 precipitation (reviewed by Guerriero et al., 2016a). In rice cell suspension culture, a hemicellulose-bound form of Si has been identified (He et al., 2015), in horsetail mixed-linkage glucans (MLGs) have been proposed to participate in SiO2 formation (Fry et al., 2008) and this has been recently confirmed in rice where overexpression of a hydrolase acting on MLGs was shown to affect silicification (Kido et al., 2015). In horsetail, callose was shown to template biosilicification (Law and Exley, 2011). Very recently, the role of callose in templating biosilicification has been additionally proven by using Arabidopsis plants either overexpressing or lacking the callose synthase gene PMR4 (Brugire and Exley, 2017): while the wild-type plants and overexpressors responded to a pathogen-like challenge by accumulating both callose and silica, the mutants did not produce callose and, consequently, deposited significantly less silica.. . . Si Priming. Several papers demonstrated that Si(OH)4 (hereafter referred to as Si for simplicity) acts as a tonic by priming plants, i.e., by preparing the defense responses which are then fully deployed at the onset of the stress, as will be discussed in detail in the next sections. The effects of Si under normal conditions are indeed latent, since, for the majority of the studies available, no major modifications, e.g., in gene expression, are observed. Under control conditions Si probably activates the metabolic status of the plant, by making it more efficient in responding to exogenous stimuli.. In rice, a Si-accumulator, Si causes alterations of C/N balance in the source-sink relationship under unstressed conditions, by favoring a remobilization of amino acids to support the increased N demand during grain development (Detmann et al., 2012, 2013). These data support the hypothesis that Si has a signaling role in plant cells. Si was indeed suggested to have a role as second messenger by binding to the hydroxyl groups of proteins involved in cell signaling, thereby partaking in the signal transduction (Fauteux et al., 2005).. It is important to mention that Si primes defense responses also in Si non-accumulators, i.e., tomato (Ghareeb et al., 2011): tomato is protected against Ralstonia solanacearum by Si which causes an upregulation, upon infection, of genes involved in ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling, i.e., JERF3, TRSF1, ACCO, as well as genes involved in stress response, i.e., trehalose phosphatase, late embryogenesis abundant protein, ferritin. In this study, the authors also observed an increased expression of a negative regulator of the jasmonic acid signal, JAZ1, together with a ubiquitin protein-ligase: the authors propose that JAZ1 helps in preventing the eventual damage caused by the stimulation of defense-related compounds and that the ubiquitin protein-ligase may degrade JAZ1. In tomato challenged by R. solanacearum, Si also upregulates a MAPK (MAPK19), a WRKY transcription factor and linker histones (H1 and H5). These findings corroborate the role of Si in intracellular signaling and suggest its involvement in transcription too (Ghareeb et al., 2011).. Silicon was shown to upregulate the expression of a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) in rice (Fleck et al., 2011), which is a protein involved in intracellular signal transduction. High-throughput technologies relying on omics will help shed light on the missing genes/proteins involved in the signal transduction underlying Si priming (the so-called prime-omics; Balmer et al., 2015).. . . Si and Abiotic Stress Alleviation. Si assumes key functions in the plant response to numerous environmental constraints. Two major processes contributing to stress resistance are commonly considered (i) a physical and mechanical protection afforded by SiO2 deposits and (ii) a biochemical response triggering metabolic changes. The precise distribution/speciation of accumulated Si in plant tissue allows us to gain additional information regarding its modalities of action and requires the use of biophysical tools, such as laser ablation (LA), extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and micro particle-induced X-ray emission (micro-PIXE).. According to Liang et al. (2013), Si improves lodging resistance by strengthening the stem basis in rice. It also enhances UV tolerance due to the protective effect of Si deposition bodies on the leaf epidermis (Goto et al., 2003) or by reducing UVB-induced membrane damages (Shen et al., 2010).. Silicon influences water relations in drought-treated plants: it induces the formation of a silica cuticle double layer under the leaf epidermis which reduces water losses through cuticular transpiration (Gong et al., 2003). Si also reduces stomatal conductance in relation to turgor loss of guard cells resulting from Si deposition and modified cell wall properties (Zhu and Gong, 2014). Si improvement of drought resistance may also be ascribed to strong abilities to extract water from the soil as a consequence of Si-related promotion of root elongation (Hattori et al., 2005) and up-regulation of aquaporin genes (Liu et al., 2015).. Silicon contributes to salt stress alleviation through inhibition of Na+ (Zhu and Gong, 2014) and Cl- (Shi et al., 2013) uptake. Translocation of toxic ions from root to shoot is also reduced by Si supply (Savvas and Ntatsi, 2015). In rice, Si alleviates NaCl toxicity by blocking the transpirational bypass flow through precipitation as SiO2 in exodermis and endodermis (Yeo et al., 1999). Potassium uptake allowing the maintenance of K/Na is improved by Si nutrition which has a direct stabilizing effect on proton pump activity in salt-treated root tips (Xu et al., 2015).. In metal-polluted soil, Si may influence the bioavailability of toxic elements. The presence of soil sodium metasilicate or alkaline Si-containing material may induce a rise in the rhizospheric pH leading to a decrease in available heavy metal concentration in the soil (Wu et al., 2013). Soluble silicate hydrolyzes to generate gelatinous metasilicic acid (H2SiO3) retaining heavy metals (Gu et al., 2011). According to Kidd et al. (2001), Si-treated plants may also exude phenolics such as catechin and quercetin having strong Al-chelating abilities. The formation of hydroxyl-aluminum silicate in the apoplast also contributes to Al detoxification (Wang et al., 2004).. Compartmentation of toxic ions is an important process in heavy metal tolerance. Si improves heavy metal retention by roots, with an obvious accumulation in the endodermis (Keller et al., 2015). At the shoot level, accumulation of Mn was mainly observed in epidermis in response to Si treatment (Doncheva et al., 2009). Iwasaki and Matsumura (1999) reported that Si increases Mn accumulation in the leaf trichomes. Controversial data are available in the literature regarding co-precipitation of Si with heavy metals. Keller et al. (2015) did not detect Cu and Cd in phytoliths and the absence of Cu-Si coprecipitation was also noticed in maize by Collin et al. (2014). He et al. (2013), however, identified a mechanisms of co-deposition of Si and Cd in the rice cell walls via a [Si-wall matrix] Cd complexation, which may explain a Si-induced decrease in the Cd influx in cells. Ma et al. (2015) considered that a hemicellulose bound form of Si with a net negative charge is responsible for inhibition of Cd uptake leading to a downregulation of Nramp5 coding for a transporter involved in Cd transport. Kim et al. (2014) also reported a downregulation of other heavy metals transporter (OsHMA2 and OsHMA3) when Cu/Cd-treated rice was supplied by Si.. Numerous studies reported that Si induces an improved behavior of heavy metal-treated plants in relation to regulation of antioxidant enzymes (Adrees et al., 2015), oversynthesis of endogenous antioxidants leading to mitigation of oxidative stress (Imtiaz et al., 2016), maintenance of net photosynthesis relying on the stabilization of chloroplast structures, PSII integrity and increased pigment concentration (Nwugo and Huerta, 2008; Tripathi et al., 2015a). Si may thus be of paramount importance for triggering adapted plant response, but the precise molecular cues involved in the adaptative processes still need to be clearly identified.. . . Si and Biotic Stress. Si was reported to improve defense against biotic constraints occurring in the form of plant pathogens (fungi, bacteria, and viruses) or animals (vertebrates and arthropod herbivores).. Silicon deposition increases abrasiveness of plant tissues and thus reduces palatability and digestibility for herbivores (Massey and Hartley, 2009). Hartley et al. (2015) demonstrated by Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) that phytolith morphology inside the tissues has more influence on abrasiveness than the actual Si concentration. Using the same technique, Keeping et al. (2009) demonstrated that the pattern of Si deposition in sugarcane is responsible for enhanced resistance to Eldana saccharina. Physical strength of the leaf resulting from Si accumulation may afford mechanical protection and thus lower the rate of infection as reported for Rhizoctonia solani (Zhang et al., 2013; Schurt et al., 2014) or Bipolaris oryzae (Ning et al., 2014).. Biochemical/molecular mechanisms are also induced or re-inforced by Si allowing the plant to improve resistance to biotic stress and include defensive compounds such as phenolics, phytoalexins and momilactones (Remus-Borel et al., 2005), but also to activation of defensive enzymes such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, lipoxygenase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (Rahman et al., 2015). According to Cai et al. (2008), Si treatments may increase transcripts levels corresponding to those defense-related genes.. Reynolds et al. (2016) reported that Si also operates by attracting predators or parasitoids to plant under herbivore attack. Indeed, soluble Si contributes to increase herbivore-induced plant volatiles to promote predator attraction by pest-infected plants. Moreover, according to James (2003) and Connick (2011), the phenology of insects life cycle is also slowed down in Si-treated plants, making it more prone to predation.. . . Effects of Si on Phytohormones. Silicon impacts on endogenous phytohormones are commonly analyzed in response to stress conditions. In rice plants exposed to heavy metals, Si reduced endogenous concentration of jamonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), while abscisic acid (ABA) first increased and then decreased after 14 days of treatment (Kim et al., 2014): the ABA has an antagonist behavior with JA/SA biosynthesis. The effect of such phytohormonal changes on the expression of genes involved in heavy metal response still needs to be elucidated in Si-treated plants. Kim et al. (2011) also reported that Si reduced JA concentration in response to wounding, while Lee et al. (2010) reported an increase in gibberellins concentration in Si-treated plants exposed to salinity.. Resistance to biotrophic pathogens may be associated with SA whereas JA and ethylene (ET) are generally associated with resistance to necrotrophic pathogens. Fauteux et al. (2006) showed that Si improved biosynthesis of SA, JA and ET in leaves exposed to Erysiphe cichoracearum. Similarly, Si-treated tomato plants exposed to R. solanacearum activated JA and ET signaling pathways to increase resistance (Ghareeb et al., 2011). Brunings et al. (2009) also provided evidence that genes controlling ET signaling pathway may be activated by Si treatment. Conversely, Si improves resistance to the fungus Cochliobolus miyabeanus by interfering with the production of fungal ET (Van Bockhaven et al., 2015). Data regarding the effect of Si on phytohormone metabolism in the absence of stress are still rare. Markovich et al. (2017), however, recently demonstrated that Si increases cytokinin biosynthesis in Sorghum and Arabidopsis and that such an increase may strongly contribute to delay senescence. Plant hormones interactions are responsible for a complex biochemical and physiological network: a deep understanding of Si influence on hormonal properties thus requires technical approaches allowing to quantify a wide range of hormonal compounds simultaneously, including minor conjugated forms.. . . Silica Nanoparticles. The use of nanotechnology in agriculture is gaining importance because it contributes to develop new sustainable strategies. Nanomaterials can for example be engineered to immobilize nutrients or to release them in a controlled manner in the soil (Fraceto et al., 2016).. Some papers in the literature have studied the effects of silica nanoparticles (SNPs) on plant physiology and we will here review some of them.. Mesoporous SNPs (MSNPs, 20 nm in size) coupled to FITC were shown to be taken up by three important crops (lupin, wheat, maize), as well as Arabidopsis protoplasts and to be translocated to the aerial parts following the xylematic flow after entering the roots via symplastic/apoplastic routes (Sun et al., 2014). Very interestingly, this study also showed that MSNPs accumulated in the cell walls, therefore highlighting the existence of an affinity with cell wall components. The monodisperse nature of the MSNPs and their size, achieved via a fine-tuning of pH and surfactant concentration, were essential for the efficient uptake by plants: the entry takes place via the pores in the cell walls of the roots cells (Sun et al., 2014).. Mesoporous SNPs were shown to boost the growth, total protein content and photosynthesis of lupin and wheat seedlings and to induce no changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (Sun et al., 2016). Interestingly in this study, the authors observed a shift of 14 cm-1 and 10 cm-1 in the Raman peaks of chlorophyll from wheat and lupin when isolated chloroplasts were incubated with MSNPs suggesting a change in the molecular structure of chlorophyll.. Silica nanoparticles were shown to protect wheat seedlings against UV-B stress by stimulating the antioxidant defense system (Tripathi et al., 2016). In particular, SNPs reduced the adverse effects of the UV-B stress, i.e., low fresh weight, reduction in chlorophyll and tissue damage. Since the levels of nitric oxide reached a peak after UV-B+SNPs treatment, a protective role via the modulation of NO levels was proposed by the authors.. Silica nanoparticles also conferred protection via mitigation of oxidative stress in pea seedlings treated with Cr(VI): the activities of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase increased significantly in the presence of SNPs, while catalase, glutathione reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase were less inhibited by Cr(VI) in the presence of SNPs (Tripathi et al., 2015b).. Silica nanoparticles (12 nm) were also found to improve germination in a known Si-excluder, tomato: at a concentration of 8 g/L, SNPs improved seedling germination, as well as fresh and dry weight by 116.6 and 117.5% respectively (Siddiqui and Al-Whaibi, 2014).. Nanostructured SiO2 (TMS) was shown to be valuable in larch seedling production, because, when applied to the roots of 1-year-old seedlings via soaking for 6 h, it promoted lateral root growth, main root length and chlorophyll content (Bao-shan et al., 2004).. The effect of SNPs was, however, shown to be dependent on the plant species, as in Bt-transgenic cotton they significantly decreased plant growth (Le et al., 2014). SNPs toxicity may be linked to pH and nutrient adsorption problems. Indeed, in thale cress, SNPs phytotoxicity was triggered when the pH of the medium was not adjusted or silanol groups were not removed from the surface (Slomberg and Schoenfisch, 2012). The alkaline pH (pH 8 ca.) makes nutrients less available for uptake, while the negatively charged SNPs tend to adsorb nutrients.. . . Si and Fiber Crops. Fiber crops like textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) are natural resources which provide long and strong cellulosic fibers (a.k.a. bast fibers) used in both the textile and biocomposite sectors (Guerriero et al., 2014; Andre et al., 2016; Guerriero et al., 2016b). Given the positive effects of Si on plants, its use for fiber crop growth may provide an enhanced biomass yield and, therefore, an increased production of bast fibers. The association of SiO2 with the fiber cell walls may provide new properties, notably and increased durability. In this respect, it should be noted that hemp woody fibers, which contain SiO2 and therefore bind well with lime, are already used to manufacture a lightweight concrete-like material used in eco-construction and known as hempcrete. The few studies available on the specific Si impact on fiber crops confirm protection against abiotic stresses. In ramie [Boehmeria nivea (L.) Gaud.], the application of Si ameliorated Cd toxicity via stimulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes (Tang et al., 2015). Bakry et al. (2015) and Shedeed et al. (2016) reported that foliar application of Si improved the nutrient status of flax and increased straw and oil yield/plant.. Silicon accumulation in fiber crops is genetically controlled, as demonstrated for bamboos by Collin et al. (2012). Exogenous Si did not reduce Cu absorption by bamboos growing on contaminated solution, but reduced toxicity symptoms (Collin et al., 2013, 2014). Si also improved the growth of cotton exposed to Cd but, in this case, Si reduced Cd uptake and mitigated the adverse effect of this heavy metal by improving plant growth, biomass and photosynthetic parameters in stressed plants (Farooq et al., 2013).. Data concerning the direct influence of Si on fiber development itself are crucially lacking. Some old studies, however, provided indirect evidences that Si may assume important functions in this respect. Khan and Roy (1964) reported that soil application of silicate improved the size of the commercial fiber jute by increasing cell elongation and fineness. According to Boylston (1988), the Si concentration is high during the elongation phase of cotton fiber development but decreases as the fiber matures. The ratio of the amount of Si per mass of fiber peaks at the time when secondary wall initiation occurs (Boylston et al., 1990). Si is known to interact with cell walls (see Introduction), although the mechanisms underlying the final incorporation of polymerized Si into the cell wall remain elusive. Kido et al. (2015) recently demonstrated that the interaction of mixed linkage glucan (1;3, 1;4)--D-glucan with Si may have obvious mechanical consequences.. Si beneficial influence on natural fiber properties is confirmed by the use of Si-containing compounds during industrial processing of harvested fibers. Natural fibers are gaining attention in engineering composite industry. However, cell wall polymers often bear hydrophilic hydroxyl groups able to form new hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which hinder hydroxyl group to react with the polar matrix of the composites (Mwaikambo and Ansell, 2002). Silane is an inorganic compound (SiH4) commonly used to improve tensile strength and thermal stability of natural fibers (Abdelmouleh et al., 2004) which may be due to the emergence of Si-O-C and Si-O-Si links on the cellulose surface (Lu et al., 2013). Other Si treatment, including siloxane and nano Si dioxide are also used for similar purposes (Kabir et al., 2012; Siengchin and Dangtungee, 2014; Orue et al., 2016). It may thus be hypothesized that Si treatment in vivo during fiber development (and not only in vitro on harvested mature fibers) may lead to several promising application. This exciting goal, however, requires a multidisciplinary approach to gain a better understanding of Si influence on the modalities of fiber development (Figure 1).. . FIGURE 1. .

A deep understanding of processes involved in Si absorption, translocation and physiological consequences require holistic -omics approaches including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics tools. The precise Si distribution may be assessed by laser ablation (LA), extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and micro particle-induced X ray emission (micro-PIXE).. . . . . . Conclusion and Future Perspectives. Silicon is an abundant element on Earth and its positive effects on plants make it important in agriculture. The study of the Si-plant binomium has still much to teach us and this is particularly the case for e.g., the cell wall-related mechanisms underlying its prophylactic role under stress. The plant cell wall takes active part in the response to (a)biotic stresses by establishing a signaling cascade toward the cell interior (Hamann, 2015) and by undergoing a remodeling (Tenhaken, 2014). It is therefore clear that part of the beneficial effects of Si on plants is linked to direct/indirect effects on the cell wall.. In the future, research activities centered on specific aspects of the interaction Si-plants will be important to devise agricultural strategies aimed at improving crop yield.. . .

PMC5362242	Introduction. Pathogens secrete effector proteins as molecular weapons to evade or suppress plant immunity. Most effectors are small secreted proteins [1,2,3], and in many cases, the expression of these genes is induced by infection, helping the microbe to successfully colonize on the surface or inside of the host [1]. Studies of the secretion system have revealed diverse manners for pathogen effector translocation into their host. Fungi secrete different effectors at different infection stages from stage-specific compartments at the host-pathogen interface [4]. Before penetrating host cells, some effector proteins are focally secreted from appressorial penetration pores and may function to suppress early plant defense responses, as in case of several Colletotrichum species [4,5]. After invasive hypha developed, effectors in Colletotrichum orbiculare accumulate at the pathogen-plant biotrophic interface, a ring-like region around the neck of the biotrophic primary hypha [5]. Effectors of some plant fungal pathogens are putatively translocated into the host cell, where they interact with cytoplasmic or nuclear R proteins [6]. For example, Magnaporthe oryzae has a highly localized structure to accumulate cytoplasmic effectors secreted by invasive hyphae, known as the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), which forms at the tip of the initially filamentous hypha in the host cell [7,8].. Secretion of effectors to the host is also important for soil-borne fungal and oomycete pathogens, such as Verticillium dahliae and Phytophthora sojae, for successful infection [9,10]. Transit of many oomycete or fungal effectors to host cell depends only on the RXLR motif or other host-entry motifs of the effectors and host molecules, but not pathogen-encoded machinery [11,12]. However, however, the mechanism(s) by which root-infecting fungal pathogens secrete secretory protein remains unknown. V. dahliae causes vascular wilt disease [13,14] and infects more than 200 host species worldwide, including many economically important crops, such as lettuce, cotton and tomato [15]. V. dahliae contains more than 100 small cysteine-rich potentially secreted proteins [3]. So far, only two effectors, Ave1 and Vdlsc1, have been functionally studied. Ave1 contributes to fungal virulence in the absence of its corresponding R protein (Ve1) [9]; it is a small secreted protein containing 134 amino acids (aa) with four cysteines [9], however, its secretion process has not been studied. Vdlsc1 suppresses salicylate-mediated innate immunity in planta [10]. Vdlsc1 is an unconventionally secreted protein as it lacks an N-terminal signal peptide that can direct the protein to the conventional secretory pathway [10]. Therefore, whether the soil-borne V. dahliae, a root-infecting phytopathogenic fungus, have a highly localized structure to secret secretory effector proteins remains unexplored.. We recently identified and provided the molecular features of the infectious structure, the hyphopodium, in V. dahliae [16]. We demonstrate that V. dahliae NADPH oxidase B (VdNoxB) is required for local reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during infection, and ROS-Ca2+ signaling in the hyphopodium plays key roles in regulating polarized penetration peg formation and pathogenicity in V. dahliae [16]. In M. oryzae, the Nox2 (NoxB)-NoxR complex spatially organizes a heteroligomeric septin ring at the appressorium pore [17,18]. Septins, small morphogenetic guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), are thought to reorient and reorganize the cytoskeleton to determine cell shape [19]. Septin ring scaffolds a toroidal F-actin ring and recruits and organizes the exocyst to the appressorium pore where the penetration peg emerges [17,18,20].. In this study, to explore whether the secretion of effectors in V. dahliae could be associated with the penetration peg, we first verified that VdNoxB was required for the cytoskeletal organization of a septin ring at the penetration peg and its derived hyphal neck in V. dahliae. We observed that the septin-ring-organized hyphal neck acts as a functional fungus-host penetration interface for the delivery and secretion of signal peptide-containing secretory proteins. Using gene functional analyses, we further showed that VdSep5, the conventional fungal ER-to-Golgi secretion pathway, the endosome-mediated transport, and the exocyst complex are involved in the delivery of secretory proteins to the penetration interface.. . . Results. . VdNoxB-dependent penetration peg and its derived hyphal neck are repeatedly developed during V. dahliae infection of plant roots. Verticillium dahliae infection requires the development of an infectious structure, hyphopodium, in which the NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit VdNoxB is specifically expressed to regulate formation of the penetration peg to pierce the cell wall [16]. To further understand the infection process, we used FITC-WGA (FITC-conjugated. wheat germ agglutinin) to label the fungal hyphae of wild-type V. dahliae strain V592 to assess cellophane penetration and root infection. We observed repeated development of hyphopodium for penetration inside the cellophane and roots (Fig 1A and 1B, S1 and S2 Movies). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that after penetration, the invasive hypha grew, and the penetration peg acted as a hyphal neck that partitioned the hyphopodium and invasive hypha and came into close contact with the cellophane (Fig 1C) or the host (Fig 1D), forming the fungus-host penetration interface. WGA staining showed various uneven hyphal neck lengths after piercing the cellophane or root cell wall (Fig 1A and 1B). The length of the hyphal neck reflects the length of the penetration peg and might be dependent on the piercing sites of different cells, such as the root epidermis or cortical cells, and the piercing angle. Repeated development of hyphopodium inside the cellophane was observed using V592 expressing GFP-tagged VdNoxB under the native promoter (S2A Fig) [16]. Inside the cellophane, the GFP signal was observed in flattened irregular hyphopodia and at the tips of the penetration pegs (S2B Fig). The Vdnoxb mutant, in which VdNoxB was deleted, was incapable of producing a penetration peg (S2C Fig). Together, our results demonstrate that V. dahliae infection requires VdNoxB-dependent, repeated development of the hyphopodium and penetration peg for each cell wall penetration, and the penetration peg-derived hyphal neck connects the hyphopodium to the invasive hypha and marks a site of close fungus-host penetration interface contact.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006275.g001. Fig 1. . Penetration peg-derived hyphal neck partitioning the hyphopodium and invasive hypha.. (A, B) Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of the development and penetration of hyphopodium of V. dahliae V592 on cellophane (A) and Arabidopsis thaliana root (B).

The dashed lines represent the penetration interface of the penetration peg-derived hyphal neck on cellophane. HP, hyphopodium; HN, hyphal neck; IH, invasive hypha. Bar = 2.5 m in (C) and Bar = 0.5 m in (D).. . . . . . Organization of the cytoskeletal septin ring at the penetration peg and its derived hyphal neck. To explore the specific features of the penetration peg and its derived hyphal neck, we first examined whether the cytoskeleton protein septin plays a role in determining penetration peg morphogenesis in V. dahliae. The V. dahliae homolog of Septin5 was identified (S1B Fig) and named VdSep5. VdSep5-GFP was expressed in the V592 and Vdnoxb mutant. In the wild-type V592 hyphopodium during penetration peg induction, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observation revealed a continuous funnel-shaped VdSep5-GFP fluorescent signal from the base of the hyphopodium, outlining the curved contact area between the hyphopodium and cellophane membrane (Fig 2A, plane 1.5 m), to the central protruded zone (refer to the hyphopodium pore) where the penetration peg was initially developed and spread throughout to its tip (Fig 2A, from plane 2.7 to 4.5 m). In contrast, in the Vdnoxb hyphopodium, the VdSep5-GFP signal outlined the curved contact area between the hyphopodium and the cellophane membrane but without the central septin ring at the base of the hyphopodium (Fig 2B). In wild-type V592, compared with the widest part of the VdSep5-GFP signal area (Fig 2A, plane 1.5 m), the diameter of the VdSep5-GFP ring at the hyphopodium pore (Fig 2A, plane 2.7 m) was reduced approximately 58%, while there was no clear reduction of the diameter of the VdSep5-GFP signal area in the Vdnoxb mutant, which is deficient in penetration peg formation (Fig 2C). After cellophane piercing and invasive hyphal growth, we observed the compact septin ring signal retained in the hyphal neck (Fig 2D). These results demonstrate that VdNoxB is required for VdSep5 organization of the cytoskeleton to determine the morphogenesis of the penetration peg and its derived hyphal neck.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006275.g002. Fig 2. . VdNoxB is required for the formation of a septin ring at the penetration peg and hyphal neck in V. dahliae..

In V592, from the widest part at the base of the hyphopodium (the 1.5-m plane) to the hyphopodium pore (the 2.7-m plane); in Vdnoxb, from the 2.1-m plane to the 3.9-m plane. The bar chart shows the average diameter of the fluorescence signal ring, and 20 hyphopodia were investigated in each assay with three replicates (*P<0.05; t-test). (D, E) VdSep5-GFP localized at the hyphal neck partitioning the hyphopodium and the invasion hypha on cellophane (D) or A. Thaliana roots (E). Bar = 2.5 m. (F) The VdSep5-GFP ring localized at two individual penetration sites during root epidermis and cortical cell wall penetration. Bar = 2.5 m.. . . . After infecting Arabidopsis root with wild-type V. dahliae V592, a VdSep5-GFP ring was also observed at the hyphal neck partitioning the hyphopodium and invasive hyphae (Fig 2E). Two VdSep5-GFP rings were observed in the first and second hyphal necks in two CLSM planes within the same scanning view (Fig 2F, 3.6 m for the first penetration and 13.2 m for the second penetration), verifying the requirement of multiple penetrations for each new cell wall to reach the vascular bundle. Together, our results clearly demonstrate that septin-ring organization accompanies V. dahliae penetration of either cellophane or plant roots, and VdNoxB plays a role in the organization of the septin ring at the penetration peg and its derived hyphal neck. Remarkably, once established, the VdSep5-GFP ring was retained at and framed the hyphal neck, forming the fungus-host penetration interface.. Consistent with previous findings that septin scaffolds a toroidal F-actin ring at the appressorium pore in M. oryzae [17,18], we also observed that F-actin was organized as a ring structure at the hyphal neck in either cellophane or root by live-cell imaging of V592 expressing LifeAct-GFP (S3 Fig).. . . Secretory proteins are preferentially localized at penetration interfaces. Next, we investigated whether the septin-ring-organized hyphal neck, in addition to its piercing role, could act as a functional fungus-host penetration interface for the delivery of secretory proteins. The arsenal of potentially secreted proteins in plant pathogens includes key pathogenicity molecules that are generally referred to as effectors (small cysteine-rich proteins, <400 amino acids (aa) and 4 cysteine residues) [3]. Because the well-known Ave1 secreted effector has not been identified in the cotton isolate V592, we selected three small cysteine-rich proteins (SCP), VDAG_08085 (194 aa, 6 Cys, named VdSCP8), VDAG_00902 (375 aa, 16 Cys, VdSCP9) and VDAG_05717 (205aa, 4 Cys, VdSCP10), for analysis in this study. Each of these SCPs has an N-terminal signal peptide predicted by the SignalP 4.1 server (S4A Fig) [21]. Among them, VdSCP9 is a LysM domain-containing protein. The LysM effector family contains relatively conserved secretory proteins that are known to play significant roles in the pathogen-host interaction [3,22,23,24]. VdSCP8 was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of the V592 culture filtrate, and VdSCP10 was one of the potential pathogenicity genes in our previous screening of the T-DNA insertional mutant library [25] and confirmed by the targeted gene replacement mutant of VdSCP10 (S5 Fig). Transcript levels of these SCP genes were first examined using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression levels of VdSCP9 and VdSCP10, but not VdSCP8, were significantly up-regulated at 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) of V592 on cellophane and at 2 dpi on cotton roots (S4B Fig). To observe the localization of these SCPs, VdSCP8-GFP, VdSCP9-GFP and VdSCP10-GFP were expressed under the native promoter. Only VdSCP8-GFP fluorescence was detectable as a ring signal at the penetration zone on cellophane (S4C Fig). Neither VdSCP9-GFP nor VdSCP10-GFP fluorescence was observed on cellophane. Therefore, these GFP fusion proteins were constructed under the oliC promoter. The V. dahliae small effector VdIsc1 (190 aa, 1 Cys), which lacks a signal peptide and exhibits characteristics that lead to unconventional secretion [10], was also fused to GFP as a control. After V. dahliae invasion into cellophane, VdSCP8-GFP, VdSCP9-GFP and VdSCP10-GFP, but not the control VdIsc1-GFP, showed ring signals surrounding the penetration zones (Fig 3A). From a picture of the penetration at an incline, the VdSCP10-GFP ring signal was clearly observed surrounding the hyphal neck linking the hyphopodium to the invasive hypha (Fig 3B).We also fused the signal peptides of SCPs to GFP and found that SPVdSCP8-GFP, SPVdSCP9-GFP and SPVdSCP10-GFP also showed ring signals outside the plasma membrane of the penetration zones (S4D Fig). To detect whether the SCP-GFP signal rings overlapping with the septin ring, VdSep5-RFP was co-expressed with VdSCP8-GFP in V592, and the results showed that the VdSep5-RFP ring was inside the VdSCP8-GFP ring (Fig 3C). Similar results were obtained for VdSCP9-GFP and VdSCP10-GFP, demonstrating that signal peptide-containing SCPs accumulate and/or are delivered to the hyphal neck for secretion. Together, these data suggest that the hyphal neck made up a fungus-host penetration interface for the delivery and/or exportation of secretory proteins.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006275.g003. Fig 3. . Accumulation of secretory proteins surrounding the hyphal neck on cellophane.. (A) VdSCP8-GFP, VdSCP9-GFP and VdSCP10-GFP but not VdIscI-GFP, showed ring signal accumulation at the hyphal necks. Images were obtained at 8 days after the fungal strains were incubated on M0 medium overlaid with cellophane, in each invasive hyphae were observed. Bar = 2.5 m. (B) The VdSCP10-GFP ring signal surrounds hyphal neck. The hyphal plasma membrane was stained with FM4-64 (red). VdSCP10-GFP, FM4-64, and fluorescence merge images are z-series stacks.

(D) FRAP detection of the dynamic accumulation/delivery of VdSCP10-GFP at the hyphal neck on cellophane. Fluorescence at the penetration interface (Pre-bleach) was photobleached (Bleach) and allowed to recover 100% for 27 min (Recovery). Bar = 2.5 m. (E) Plot of normalized penetration interface fluorescence intensity recovery over time for VdSCP10-GFP. (F) The average recovery time of VdSCP8-GFP, VdSCP9-GFP and VdSCP10-GFP after bleaching on cellophane. Three FRAP tests were performed for each sample.. . . . Next, we inoculated strains of V592 expressing the GFP-tagged SCPs on Arabidopsis roots. VdSCP8-GFP accumulation was first observed at approximately 2 dpi. A strong VdSCP8-GFP signal ring was observed at the hyphal neck, which partitioned the hyphopodium and the invasive hypha (Fig 4A and 4B). Some weak signals were also observed inside the invasive hyphae (Fig 4A and 4B). VdSCP9-GFP accumulation was first observed at 1 dpi. One weak and one strong VdSCP9-GFP signal ringwas observed, respectively, at the first and second hyphal neck in two CLSM planes in the same scanning view (Fig 4C at planes of 1.8 m and 4.8 m). This observation is consistent with the requirement of the repeated development of the hyphopodium for each cell wall penetration during the colonization of V592 from the root surface to the vascular bundle (Fig 1B). The VdSCP10-GFP ring signal was observed at approximately 6 dpi. In the upper plane of the hyphopodium (0 m), a weak VdSCP10-GFP speckle signal was observed at the periphery of the hyphal cell and on two sides of a septa (Fig 4D). A stronger signal was observed at the apex of the hyphopodium (Fig 4D). The clear and strongest VdSCP10-GFP ring signal was observed at and throughout the hyphal neck using a series of continuous scanning planes (Fig 4D). Taken together, our data demonstrate that successful invasion of plant roots and cellophane by V. dahliae has the common phenomenon of signal peptide-containing secretory protein recruitment at the hyphal neck for effective secretion through this fungus-host penetration interface. The detectable ring signals for each secretory protein at different time points suggest that their synthesis and/or rate of delivery were different, revealing a complex process for successful infection in plant roots by V. dahliae.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006275.g004. Fig 4. . Accumulation of secretory proteins at the hyphal neck during root colonization..

Black dashed line outlining the hyphopodium in the first picture and white dashed line marking the beginning of an invasive hypha. Fluorescence micrographs of (A,B,C) were merged from 23 continuous z series images. Asterisks indicate the ring signals. Bar = 2.5 m.. . . . We then examined whether the directional ring-shaped accumulation of the small secretory proteins was derived from dynamic secretion towards the penetration interface. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed with the V592 strain expressing VdSCP10-GFP on cellophane at 6 dpi. We photobleached VdSCP10-GFP fluorescence at the penetration site and then monitored the fluorescence recovery over time. After near complete elimination, fluorescence recovered within 27 min (Fig 3D and 3E). The fluorescence recovery time for VdSCP8-GFP and VdSCP9-GFP was 22 min and 18 min, respectively (Fig 3F). These data suggest that secretory proteins were continuously synthesized and/or delivered to the penetration interface.. . . VdSep5 plays a role in the delivery of protein secretion toward the penetration interface. To detect whether septin also plays a role in the delivery of secretory proteins to penetration interfaces, the targeted gene knockout mutants Vdsep5 and Vdsep3 were generated in wild-type V592 (S6A and S6B Fig). The VdSep3 homologous sequence was searched from V592 based on a BLASTP search using MoSep3 and the VdLs.17 database (S1A Fig). The VdSep3 knockout mutant strain exhibited a reduced hyphal growth rate on PDA medium compared with V592 (S6D Fig), and developed an abnormal hyphopodium on cellophane without smooth swelling at the end of branching hypha (S6F Fig) that was incapable of forming a penetration peg to pierce the cellophane (S6E Fig). This result demonstrates that VdSep3 plays roles in hyphal growth and hyphopodium development. In contrast, the VdSep5 knockout mutant strain exhibited a normal growth rate on PDA medium (S6D Fig) but developed fewer hyphopodia on cellophane (S6F and S6G Fig) and displayed greatly delayed penetration of the cellophane compared with V592 (S6E Fig), demonstrating that VdSep5 plays a role in hyphopodium development. Consistently, both the Vdsep3 and the Vdsep5 mutant showed reduced virulence on cotton plants (S6H and S6I Fig). The reintroduction of Psep3:VdSep3:Ttrpc and Ptef:VdSep5-GFP:Ttrpc restored the hyphal morphologies and cellophane penetration abilities, as well as the pathogenicity (S6D, S6E, S6H and S6I Fig), confirming the targeted gene deletion. Our results suggest that VdSep5 plays an important role in the initiation of hyphopodium formation, whereas, VdSep3 is more important for development of the hyphopodium.. To observe the localization of secretory protein in the Vdsep5 mutant, the targeted gene knockout mutant was generated in VdSCP10-GFP-expressing V592 strain. VdSCP10-GFP secretion in the VdSep5 deletion mutant was assessed. In contrast to the remarkable VdSCP10-GFP signal ring surrounding the hyphal neck in the wild-type V592 (Fig 5A), the VdSCP10-GFP signal was observed in both the hyphopodium and hyphal neck in the Vdsep5 mutant, in which either the hyphopodium or the hyphal neck was stained with FM4-64 (Fig 5A and 5B). The VdSCP10-GFP signal at the hyphal neck in the Vdsep5 mutant was clearly reduced compared with that in the wild-type V592 background (Fig 5B). The average signal intensity of VdSCP10-GFP in the hyphal neck of Vdsep5 was approximately 78% of that in V592 (Fig 5C). The FRAP assay showed 86% recovery of VdSCP10-GFP fluorescence at the penetration interface within 97 min (Fig 5D and 5E), which was significantly longer than the recovery time of 27 min for the wild-type V592. Three FRAP tests on cellophane showed a similar delayed in secretion. These results demonstrate that VdSep5 plays a role in mediating the delivery of secretory proteins to the penetration interface, in addition to its functions in hyphopodium development and cortical structure organization of the penetration peg and hyphal neck.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006275.g005. Fig 5. . Deletion of VdSep5 decreased secretory protein delivery to the hyphal neck.. (A, B) VdSCP10-GFP signal ring surrounding the hyphal neck in wild-type V592; mutant strain Vdsep5 retained most of the VdSCP10-GFP inside the hyphopodium and reduced the VdSCP10-GFP signal at the hyphal neck. The plasma membrane of HP and HN was stained with FM4-64 (red). Bar = 2.5 m. (C) Quantitative analysis of the effect of VdSep5 on VdSCP10-GFP delivery to the penetration interface. More than 30 hyphal necks with a visible signal were investigated for each strain to determine the intensity of the ring signal at the hyphal neck. Two Vdsep5 mutant strains obtained from individual VdSCP10-GFP-expressing V592 (S6B Fig) were used for the observation. The mean and SD were calculated from two VdSCP10-GFP-expressing V592 and the corresponding Vdsep5 strains with two biological repeats (*P<0.05; t-test). (D, E) FRAP assay for the dynamic accumulation/delivery of VdSCP10-GFP at the hyphal neck in Vdsep5. Three FRAP tests were performed.. . . . . . The vesicular trafficking factor SNAREs VdSec22 and VdSyn8 are involved in protein secretion toward penetration interfaces. We next investigated the role of vesicular traffic in the delivery of secretory proteins to penetration interfaces. SNAREs function as key elements in membrane fusion [26,27,28]. The R-SNARE Sec22 is important for modulating transport between the ER and the Golgi apparatus [29]. The Qc-SNARE Syn8 in S. cerevisiae and M. oryzae (MoSyn8) localizes at endosomes and/or late endosome/prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) [26,28]. To identify functional proteins in the secretion of V. dahliae, homologous sequences were searched in V592 based on a BLASTP search using MoSec22 and MoSyn8 and the database for VdLs.17, designated VdSec22 and VdSyn8, respectively (S1C and S1D Fig). Targeted gene knockout mutants Vdsec22 and Vdsyn8 were generated (S7A and S7B Fig). Both mutants exhibited growth defects with a reduced vegetative hyphal growth rate; Vdsyn8 also showed reduced melanin production (S7D Fig). The reintroduction of VdSec22 and VdSyn8 under the control of each native promoter recovered the growth ability and hyphal morphologies (S7C and S7D Fig), confirming the targeted gene deletion of VdSec22 and VdSyn8.. VdSCP10-GFP secretion in the Vdsec22 and Vdsyn8 mutants was assessed. VdSCP10-GFP expressed under the oliC promoter was transformed into Vdsec22 and Vdsyn8 mutants. The single copy insertion strains determined by Southern blot were used for further analysis (S8 Fig). In contrast to the remarkable VdSCP10-GFP signal ring in wild-type V592 (Fig 6A), the VdSCP10-GFP signal was observed in both the hyphopodia and hyphal necks in both deletion mutant strains (Fig 6B and 6C). The VdSCP10-GFP signal in the hyphal neck in both mutants was also clearly reduced, and most of the VdSCP10-GFP signal rings were overlapping with or inside the plasma membrane compared with that in the wild-type V592 background (Fig 6B and 6C). The average signal intensity of VdSCP10-GFP in the hyphal neck of Vdsec22 and VdSyn8 was approximately 54% and 70%, respectively, of that in V592 (Fig 6E), suggesting that ER-Golgi transport is a predominant route of transport of SCPs. The FRAP assay was also performed with VdSCP10-GFP-expressing Vdsec22 and Vdsyn8 mutants. Fluorescence was recovered after approximately 52 min and 45 min in Vdsec22 and Vdsyn8 mutants, respectively (Fig 6F), which was much longer than the recovery time of 27 min observed for wild-type V592. Our data demonstrate that VdSec22 and VdSyn8 play roles in mediating the delivery of secretory proteins to the penetration interface.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006275.g006. Fig 6. .

(B-D) The mutant strains Vdsec22 (B), Vdsyn8 (C) and Vdexo70 (D) retained most of the VdSCP10-GFP inside the hyphopodium and reduced the VdSCP10-GFP signal in the hyphal neck. The plasma membrane of HP and HN was stained with FM4-64 (red). (E) Quantitative analysis of the effect of VdSec22, VdSyn8, and VdExo70 on secretory protein delivery to penetration interfaces. More than 30 hyphal necks with a visible ring signal were investigated for each VdSCP10-GFP-expressing mutant strain to determine the intensity of the ring signal at the HN. The mean and SD for (E) were calculated from three independent fungal transformants for each mutant (*P<0.05; t-test). Bar = 2.5 m. (F) FRAP assay for the dynamic accumulation/delivery of VdSCP10-GFP at the hyphal neck in Vdsec22, Vdsyn8 and Vdexo70 on cellophane. Three FRAP tests were performed for each mutant strain.. . . . To further determine whether the VdSCP10-GFP signal in the hyphopodium and hyphal neck was due to decreased transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus in the mutant strains, a VdSCP10-GFP-expressing Vdsec22 mutant on cellophane was stained with ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX. The VdSCP10-GFP signal was observed to overlap with the ER in the hyphopodium (S9 Fig), suggesting that the deletion of VdSec22 resulted in retention of VdSCP10-GFP in the ER.. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the transport route between the hyphal ER and Golgi apparatus and endosome-mediated transport are involved in protein secretion toward penetration interfaces.. . . Efficient secretion of secretory proteins at the penetration interface requires the exocyst complex. The exocyst was discovered as a tethering complex that mediates the initial encounter of arriving exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane [30]. The exocyst complex is an evolutionarily conserved doctameric protein complex comprising Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84 [31,32]. To test the role of the exocyst in the accumulation of small secretory proteins at the penetration interface in V. dahliae, two predicted exocyst components, VdSec8 and VdExo70, were identified (S1E and S1F Fig). VdSec8-GFP and VdExo70-GFP were expressed under either their native promoter or the oliC promoter and introduced into V592. Similar localization profiles were observed for both GFP-tagged proteins under either the native or the oliC promoter; however, the GFP signal derived from the native promoter was weak, and thus the fluorescence signals derived from the oliC promoter were photographed. Both VdSec8-GFP and VdExo70-GFP were observed as a crescent structure at the growing tip of vegetative hyphae (S10A Fig). VdSec8-GFP and VdExo70-GFP were organized as a ring at the base of the hyphopodium that was observed before penetration peg formation on either cellophane or Arabidopsis root (S10B and S10C Fig). After the development of invasive hyphae, VdSec8-GFP was organized at the hyphal neck on either cellophane or root (S10D Fig). Together, our data demonstrate that the exocyst is active at the base of the hyphopodium and the hyphal neck.. To characterize the localization relationship between the exocyst complex and VdSep5, VdSep5-RFP was transformed into the V592-expressing Polic:VdSec8-GFP:Ttrpc strain. Red septin rings were observed in all 20 observed hyphal necks, and VdSec8-GFP signal rings were observed in 14 of the detected septin rings. The corresponding linescan confirmed the co-localization of VdSec8-GFP and VdSep5-RFP (S11 Fig).. To further study the role of exocyst subunits on secretory protein accumulation at the penetration interface, we tried to knockout VdExo70 and VdSec8 in V592. Vdexo70 mutants carrying the VdExo70 deletion were obtained (S7B Fig), but the deletion of VdSec8 was not successful, in agreement with a previous study in which M. oryzae exocyst-encoding gene knockouts generated only sec5 and exo70 mutants [20,33]. Thus, the failure to delete VdSec8 was possibly due to the lethality of the absence of Sec8 in filamentous fungi including V. dahliae and M. oryzae. The Vdexo70 mutant exhibited growth defects with a low growth rate on PDA medium (S7D Fig). The reintroduction of Polic:VdExo70-GFP:Ttrpc into the Vdexo70 mutant recovered the growth ability and hyphal morphologies (S7C and S7D Fig), confirming the targeted disruption of VdExo70. VdSCP10-GFP was then transformed into the Vdexo70 mutant and incubated on cellophane for hyphopodium induction. The single copy insertion strains determined by Southern blot were used for further analysis (S8 Fig). The VdSCP10-GFP signal was observed inside of the hyphopodium in the Vdexo70 mutant (Fig 6D). Weak signals were observed in the hyphal neck, but most of them overlapped with the FM4-64-stained plasma membrane ring (Fig 6D). The average intensity of the green fluorescence ring of VdSCP10-GFP in the Vdexo70 mutant was approximately 65% of that in V592 (Fig 6E). These results demonstrate that VdExo70 plays a role in secreting VdSCP10-GFP out of the hyphal neck. The FRAP assay on cellophane was also performed with VdSCP10-GFP in the Vdexo70 mutant. The fluorescence recovered after 63 min (Fig 6F), which was significantly longer than the recovery time of 27 min determined for wild-type V592. Taken together, our results demonstrate that exocyst components also organize at the hyphal neck and take part in the delivery of secretory proteins to penetration interfaces.. . . Proteins involved in the secretion pathway play critical roles in the pathogenicity of V. dahliae. To explore the roles of proteins involved in the secretion pathway in the pathogenicity of V. dahliae, we inoculated Vdexo70, Vdsec22 and Vdsyn8 mutants on cotton plants and found a significant (P< 0.05) reduction in the disease index for the three mutants (Fig 7A and 7B). The loss of virulence was restored when the Vdexo70, Vdsec22 and Vdsyn8 mutants were complemented with Polic:VdExo70-GFP:Ttrpc, Psec22:VdSec22:Ttrpc or Psyn8:VdSyn8:Ttrpc, respectively (Fig 7A and 7B). The significant loss of pathogenicity for the Vdexo70, Vdsec22 and Vdsyn8 mutants was presumably consistent with their inefficient secretion of effector-related secretory proteins, which are required for successful fungal pathogen infection by evading or suppressing host plant immunity. Therefore, attributed to critical roles in the efficient secretion of secretory proteins at fungus-host penetration interfaces, VdExo70, VdSec22 and VdSyn8 play important roles in the pathogenicity of V. dahliae.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006275.g007.

(A, B) Disease symptoms (A) and disease grades (B) of cotton plants infected with wild-type V592, and Vdexo70, Vdsec22 or Vdsyn8 mutants and the complementary strains at 21 dpi. The grades were evaluated with three replicates of 36 plants for each inoculum (*P<0.05; t-test).. . . . . . . Discussion. . Septin assembly at the penetration peg-derived hyphal neck framing an interface between V. dahliae hypha and the host. Penetration of the intact cuticles of the host is a very important step for successful infection by phytopathogens, either for leaf- or root-infecting fungal pathogens, such as M. oryzae and the anthracnose disease-causing Colletotrichum species or V. dahliae [4,5,16,17,34]. The foliar fungal pathogen M. oryzae forms conspicuous melanized appressoria with an average diameter of 8.0 m when it inflates to full turgor and develops penetration pegs with an average diameter of 780-nm to breach the hydrophobic, waxy leaf cuticle [18,35]. In contrast, we found herein that the root-infecting fungus V. dahliae developed hyphopodia with an average diameter of 3.4 m and formed a penetration peg with an average diameter of 1.3-m, suggesting that less pressure is needed for V. dahliae to breach the root cuticle (Fig 1C and 1D).. We observed that the nature of the interface between V. dahliae hyphae and the host is the penetration peg-derived hyphal neck, in which a septin ring was organized. In M. oryzae, septins are found to provide the cortical rigidity and membrane curvature necessary for protrusion of the rigid penetration peg to breach the leaf surface [18]. Similarly, we found that the septin ring framed a recognizable cytoskeletal region of the hyphal neck in which F-actin was also organized as a ring structure, partitioning the hyphopodium and invasive hypha on both cellophane and roots. On cellophane, we also observed a funnel-shaped septin structure prior to invasive hyphal growth, suggesting that V. dahliae septins also function in the membrane curvature necessary for protrusion of the penetration peg at the base of the hyphopodium. In the VdNoxB knock out mutant, the VdSep5-GFP signal at the base of the hyphopodium suggests that septins provide membrane curvature, but the mutant strain failed to show protrusion of the penetration peg in the absence of VdNoxB. Previous studies in yeast and in fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus suggest the importance of septin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in controlling septin assembly [36,37]. In yeast, Rts1, a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunit, regulates septin dephosphorylation during telophase, and this dephosphorylation contributes to cytokinesis [36]. Dephosphorylation of the core septin, AspB, in a PP2A-dependent manner also impacts hyphal septation in A. fumigatus [37]. In animals, PP2A is a well-known tumor suppressor. ROS accumulation in cancer cells causes nitration and inactivation of PP2A, which interferes with the interaction of Bcl-2 with the PP2A catalytic core, leading to increased phosphorylation and antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2 [38]. We recently reported that V. dahliae VdNoxB is required for local ROS production during infection and plays key roles in regulating polarized penetration peg formation [16]. Together with the regulated synthesis of ROS by M. oryzae Nox complexes directly control septin and F-actin dynamics [17], and the septin ring assembles in a kinase Chm1-dependent manner [18], we speculate that fungal Nox-dependent ROS might also play a role in inactivation of PP2A-like phosphatase, leading to increased Chm1-dependent septin phosphorylation, which is key for controlling septin assembly.. We speculate that septins also provide membrane curvature for polarity determination during penetration peg development on roots, although funnel-shaped septin signal was barely observed in the hyphopodium-penetration peg on the infected root, presumably due to a fast piercing process on the roots. The targeted gene deletions of VdSep5 or VdSep3 exhibited defects in hyphopodium and/or hyphal development, suggesting that core V. dahliae septins also act cooperatively to form heteroligomers during hyphal growth and infection. This result is consistent with previous observation in M. oryzae that septins formed rings at the neck of nascent appressoria and a wider range of structures in hyphae and during invasive growth, including bars, gauzes, collars and rings [18], in addition to an appressorium pore-located large septin ring [18]. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate the requirement for VdNoxB-dependent ROS in the regulation of cytoskeleton septin ring remodeling at the base of the hyphopodium, leading to rapid polarized growth of the penetration peg in V. dahliae. Each occurrence of penetration requires septin ring organization at the penetration peg and hyphal neck, supporting that successful colonization of extracellular hyphae to the vascular bundle requires repeated development of the hyphopodium and penetration peg, which repeatedly form penetration interfaces between V. dahliae hyphae and the host.. . . The hyphal neck-associated penetration interface as the site of delivery of secretory proteins. Plant infection by pathogens involves the deployment of effector proteins that suppress plant immune responses and facilitate proliferation of the pathogen within plant tissues [30,35]. The delivery of effectors has been shown by extra-invasive hyphal membrane (EIHM) and BIC in the first-differentiated bulbous invasive hyphae in M. grisea [7,33]. In C. higginsianum, sequential delivery of host-induced effectors by the appressorium pore and intracellular hyphae has been observed [4]. In C. orbiculare, the accumulation of effectors occurred in the ring-like region around the neck linking the penetration peg to the biotrophic primary hyphae [5]. In this study, we found that during the penetration of cellophane or plant roots, the tested SCP-GFP and SP-GFP accumulated on the penetration interfaces, indicating a general role of the penetration interface as an active secretory protein delivery zone in V. dahliae. The FRAP assay revealed the dynamic accumulation of SCPs at the penetration interfaces. Secretion of the three SCPs into the hyphal neck is likely not dependent on the biological host. However, the cellophane membrane was used to mimic the hydrophobic niche for induction of appressoria in M. grisea [39] and hyphopodia in V. dahliae [16]. Together with the identification of VdSCP8 by LC-MS of the V592 culture filtrate without any treatment, and transcripts of VdSCP9 and VdSCP10, but not VdSCP8, were induced upon incubation of V. dahliae on both cellophane and roots, we speculate that both VdSCP9 and VdSCP10 are probably in planta-expressed secretory proteins in V. dahliae. Moreover, the targeted gene deletion of VdSCP10 caused a significant decrease in virulence toward cotton plants, suggesting that VdSCP10 may function as an effector to suppress plant immune responses. Although the LysM effector family contains relatively conserved secretory proteins that are known to play significant roles in the pathogen-host interaction [3,22,23], it has been recently reported that deletion of the VdSCP9 homologous core LysM protein, Vd4LysM, in V. dahliae strain JR2, did not compromise virulence during infection in Arabidopsis, tomato or Nicotiana benthamiana [24]. Whether VdSCP9 and VdSCP8 function as effectors to suppress plant immune responses or facilitate proliferation of V. dahliae within plant tissues requires further investigation. Remarkably, the ring signals of the tested SCPs were outside and around the hyphal neck and septin ring (Fig 3), and they were reduced in the hyphal neck in the Vdsep5 mutant. These observations indicate that septins are not only required to organize the hyphal neck to form a fungus-host interface but also participate in the delivery and exportation of secretory proteins.. . . Delivery of secretory proteins to the penetration interface via vesicular trafficking coupled with exocytosis. Phytopathogenic fungi express numerous small proteins that possess classical N-terminal signal peptides that direct them to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [3,4,40] The three signal peptide-containing SCPs, but not the unconventional secretion protein VdIscI, accumulated around the hyphal neck, suggesting that secretion into the penetration interface depends on ER processing. The retention of VdSCP10-GFP in the ER of the Vdsec22 mutant demonstrates the importance of transport between the ER and the Golgi apparatus in secretory protein delivery to penetration interfaces in V. dahliae. In M. oryzae during the invasion of rice cells, ER-to-Golgi trafficking is involved in the secretion of apoplastic effectors by EIHM [33]. The sec22 mutants of C. orbiculare also show a decreased accumulation of effectors at biotrophic interfaces [5]. Similar to M. oryzae and C. orbiculare [5,41], the absence of Sec22 weakens the virulence of V. dahliae (Fig 7), suggesting that conventional ER-Golgi transport has a conserved function in the transport of some pathogen secretory proteins to interact with host molecules.. Endosomes participate in endocytosis and secretion during fungal infection in the host [28,42]. The long-distance retrograde motility of early endosomes is necessary to perceive plant cues and trigger the transcription of effector-coding genes during plant infection by the pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis, which regulates effector production and secretion during host cell invasion [43]. Syn8 in M. oryzae is involved in the secretion of BIC-localized AVR proteins but not the apoplastic effector (Bas4) in planta [28]. In Vdsyn8 mutants, the retention of VdSCP10-GFP in the hyphopodium and inside the hyphal neck, suggests that the induction of SCP delivery in V. dahliae requires cues from the fungus-contacting surface and that Vdsyn8 mutants prevent the perception of information from the contact surface, and resulting in VdSCP10-GFP retention. Thus, effective delivery of secretory proteins during fungal infection in the host requires Syn8-mediated transport/cue-sensing via endosomes.. The final steps of the secretory pathway, which occur in the vicinity of the plasma membrane, are regulated by an array of small GTPases, the exocyst tethering complex, and SNARE proteins [20,30,44]. Co-localization of VdSec8-GFP and VdSep5-RFP and the absence of VdSep5 or VdExo70 to impair the delivery of secretory proteins to the penetration interface also support septin-dependent assembly of the exocyst in V. dahliae. Together with previous reports demonstrating that cytoplasmic effector accumulation in BICs of M. oryzae also required the exocyst components Exo70 and Sec5 [33], we assume that the effective delivery of secretory proteins during infection of plant hosts requires the exocyst coupled with SNARE proteins, such as Sec22 and Syn8, to tether vesicles loaded with secretory proteins to the plasma membrane.. In summary, we provide evidence that hyphopodium-specific VdNoxB -regulated penetration peg formation accompanied by cytoskeletal organization of the septin-ring, form a fungus-host interface that functions as a site for the dynamic delivery of secretory proteins. The exocyst, VdSec22-mediated transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus and VdSyn8-mediated transport/cue-sensing via endosomes are involved in the secretion of secretory proteins, possibly including effectors, towards the interfaces (Fig 8). We assume that the fungal infectious structures function as key signaling hubs during plant infection and are the apparatus that not only breaches host cells but also generates unique interfaces for the secretion of fungal secretory proteins and associated regulatory components.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006275.g008.

The septin (VdSep5), F-actin, exocyst (VdExo70 and VdSec8), ER-Golgi traffic (VdSec22) and endosome-mediated traffic (VdSyn8) function in the delivery of secretory proteins to the penetration interface.. . . . . . . Materials and methods. . Fungal isolates, culture conditions, infection assays and DNA analysis. The virulent defoliating V. dahliae isolate V592 from cotton that originated in Xinjiang, China, was used in this study. This isolate and its transformants were stored at 80C and cultures were reactivated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 25C in the dark. The conidia for the infection assays were cultured in liquid Czapek-Dox medium. Hyphae for microscopic observation were incubated on M0 medium with urea modified as NaNO3 [45].. For plant infection, cotton plants (Xinluzao No. 16) were used in infection assays to evaluate the effect of V. dahliae isolate V592 and transformants on virulence using our laboratorys unimpaired root-dip inoculation method, as described in our previous research [25]. Disease progression was recorded after 3 weeks of incubation. The infection assay for transformants was repeated three times. The symptoms were evaluated, and the disease grade was classified as follows: 0 (no symptoms), 1 (025% wilted leaves), 2 (2550%), 3 (5075%) and 4 (75100%) [10]. The data were analyzed using the Students t-test.. Nucleic acid extraction and fungal transformation have all been previously described [25]. Single copy insertion was confirmed in transformants which were used to analyze the fluorescence intensity.. . . Preparation of deletion constructs. To generate the knockout plasmids pKOVdSCP10, pKOVdSep3, pKOVdSep5, pKOVdSec22, pKOVdSyn8 and pKOVdExo70, upstream and downstream genomic sequences were amplified with the primers shown in S1 Table. The upstream and downstream genomic sequence pairs were inserted into a position flanking the hygromycin resistance cassette of vector pGKO-HPT with the USER enzyme to generate knock-out plasmids, and transformation was performed as previously described [46].. . . Preparation of GFP fusion constructs. All of the GFP fusion constructs or RFP fusion constructs (next part) were generated by the infusion cloning method based on homologous recombination using the ClonExpress II or ClonExpress MultiS kit (Vazyme, China). The primers are shown in S1 Table. In each case, the primers contain a 15-20-bp overlap with adjoining fragments to allow the assembly of fragments by homologous recombination.. To select transformants with G418, the pSUL-NEO binary vector was created by insertion of the G418 resistance cassette amplified with Neo-F/R primers from pKOV21 into XbaI-digested pSULPH-GFP [25].. For convenient expression of the GFP fusion protein under the constitutive Tef promotor and TrpC terminator, we generated a binary vector pSUL-NEO-Tef-EKGFP-TrpC using the following steps: (1) a 0.7-kb 3GA-EGFP fragment, amplified with primers 3GAGFP-F (bearing three repeats of nucleotides encodingGA) and GFP-Nt-R from pNPP9 [47], was cloned into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pNPP94 [48], resulting in pNPP94-3GAGFP; (2) we amplified the Ptef:3GAGFP:Ttrpc fusion from pNPP94-3GAGFP using primers psul-ppn-HindIII-F and psul-ppn-EcoRI-R and recombined with the product HindIII/EcoRI-linearized pSUL-NEO to generate plasmid pSUL-NEO-Tef-3GAGFP-TrpC; (3) to separate GFP and the protein of interest, we introduced a linker with five repeats of nucleotides encoding the EAAK motif [49] into EcoRI-digested pSUL-NEO-Tef-3GAGFP-TrpC, generating plasmid pSUL-NEO-Tef-EKGFP-TrpC.. To generate the Ptef:VdSep5-GFP:Ttrpc construct, VdSep5 was amplified from the cDNA of V592 and fused into BamHI/EcoRI-linearized pSUL-NEO-Tef-EKGFP-TrpC.. To generate a binary vector that included the Tef promotor and TrpC terminator but lacked GFP, we amplified the Tef promoter and TrpC terminator from pNPP94 using primer psul-ppn-HindIII-F and psul-ppn-EcoRI-R and recombined the product with HindIII/EcoRI-linearized pSUL-NEOto generate pSUL-NEO-Tef-TrpC.. The Pnoxb:GFP-VdNoxB:Ttrpc construct was generated by cloning the GFP fragment between 2 kb upstream of the start codon and the genomic sequence of VdNoxb. The three sequences were fused into HindIII/EcoRI-linearized pSUL-NEO-Tef-TrpC.. To generate the of Ptef1:LifeAct-GFP: Ttrpc fusion construct, we amplified Ptef1: LifeAct-GFP from pAB261 [50] and integrated into HindIII/ EcoRI-linearized pSUL-NEO-Tef-TrpC.. To generate the C-terminal GFP fusion construct under the oliC promoter, the primer pair olic-HindIII-F and olic-BamHI-R were used to amplify the template pNAH-Grx1-roGFP2 plasmid [51], and the resulting PCR products were fused into HindIII/BamHI-digested pSUL-NEO-Tef-EKGFP-TrpC to generate pSUL-NEO-oliC-EKGFP-TrpC. To generate VdSCP8-GFP, VDSCP9-GFP, VDSCP10-GFP, VdSec8-GFP and VdExo70-GFP constructs with the oliC promoter, genomic sequences were amplified and fused into BamHI/EcoRI-linearized pSUL-NEO-oliC-EKGFP-TrpC.. To generate VdSCP8-GFP, VdSCP9-GFP, VdSCP10-GFP, VdSec8-GFP and VdExo70-GFP constructs with the native promoter, genomic sequences spanning 1.52 kb upstream of the start codon were amplified and fused into HindIII/EcoRI-linearized pSUL-NEO-Tef-EKGFP-TrpC using homologous recombination.. . . Preparation of the RFP fusion construct. To co-express the RFP fusion construct with the GFP fusion construct, a nourseothricin resistance cassette was amplified using the primer pair nat-F/R with the pAL6-LifeAct plasmid as template [52] and fused into XbaI/XhoI-digested pSULPH-GFP to generate pNat-GFP. We amplified the Tef promoter and TrpC terminator from pNPP94 using the primers psul-ppn-HindIII-F and trpC-xbaI-R, and we recombined them with HindIII/EcoRI-linearized pNat-GFP to generate pNat-Tef-TrpC.. To study the localization relationship between VdSep5 and VdSCP10-GFP, we constructed Ptef:VdSep5-RFP:Ttrpc which was selected by nourseothricin. First, we cloned the RFP sequence from plasmid pAL6-LifeAct [52] by EK-RFP-F and RFP-R into EcoRI-digested pNat-Tef-TrpC, resulting in pNat-Tef-EKRFP-TrpC. A VdSep5 cDNA fragment was fused into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pNat-Tef-EKRFP-TrpC, resulting in Ptef:VdSep5-RFP:Ttrpc fusion. Transformants were selected in the presence of nourseothricin (50 g/mL).. . . Preparation of complementary constructs. For complementary Vdsep3, Vdsec22 and Vdsyn8 mutants, the corresponding genomic sequences, including 1.52 kb upstream of the start codon, were amplified with the primers listed in S1 Table and fused into HindIII/EcoRI-linearized pNat-Tef-TrpC by homologous recombination. Transformants were selected in the presence of nourseothricin (50 g/mL). The Ptef:VdSep5-GFP:Ttrpc construct and Polic:VdExo70-GFP:Ttrpc were used to complementVdsep5 and Vdexo70 mutants, respectively.. . . RNA extraction and cDNA. Total RNA was isolated from frozen mycelium collected from M0 medium cultured for 3d. V. dahliae cDNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen).. . . Quantitative real-time PCR. Before reverse transcription, residual DNA was removed from the total RNA using gDNA wiper (Vazyme). cDNA was reverse transcribed using HiScript II Q RT Supermix (Vazyme), and qRT-PCR was performed using ChamQ SYBR qPCR MasterMix (Vazyme) with the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time system. The transcription levels of the target genes were quantified relative to the constitutively expressed elongation factor 1- of Verticillium dahliae (VdElf). The gene-specific primers are listed in S1 Table. Biological replicates were performed three times.. . . Light microscopy. To observe the infection of V. dahliae, A. thaliana roots were immersed in a conidial suspension (~105 conidia/mL in water solution) for 10 min and then transferred onto a 0.75% agar plate at 25C in the dark. To observe the protein localization of V. dahliae on cellophane, conidia were placed on cellophane and incubated at 25C. The mycelium grown on cellophane for 39 days was used for protein localization assays. To compare the secretory difference between V592 and Vdsec22/Vdsyn8 mutants, the fungi were collected from the outer zone of the colony at the earliest time point for most V592 hyphal necks with ring signals. The fluorescence intensity data were analyzed using the Students t-test. Small pieces (~0.5 cm2) of cellophane with mycelium at the margin of the fungal colonies were cut with a scalpel and mounted in water. Images were obtained under a confocal laser microscope (Leica TCS SP8; Leica Microsystems) with a 100oil immersion objective lens. The excitation wavelengths and emission filters were as follows: 488 nm/band-pass 500 to 550 nm for GFP, 561 nm/ band-pass 570 to 670 nm for RFP and FM4-64, and 405 nm/band-pass 400 to 600 nm for ER-Tracker. Confocal images were captured with a Leica hybrid detector and analyzed with Leica LAS AF software.. For each microscopy-based experiment, at least 20 images with three biological independent samples were observed for each micrograph to make conclusions. Each experiment was repeated at least twice.. . . Transmission electron microscopy. For TEM observation, V. dahliae-infected cotton root and V. dahliae on cellophane were fixed immediately in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, buffered with PBS (pH 7.4) at 4C overnight, washed with the same buffer four times and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. Dehydration was then performed in an acetone series (50%, 75%, 85%, 95%, 100%), and the slices were embedded in Spurrs resin mixture. Ultrathin serial sections (70 nm thickness) were cut from resin blocks, followed by uranyl acetate staining, and observed with a JEM-1400 electron microscope.. . . Staining of fungi. For plasma membrane staining, FM4-64 (ThermoFisher) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. For ER-Tracker staining, cultures were incubated at 30C for 30 min with PBS containing 1 M ER-Tracker BlueWhite DPX (Molecular Probes) that had been pre-warmed at 30C for 30 min, washed once with fresh PBS without the dye, and subjected to microscopic observation [53]. Next, 100 g/mL FITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (FITC-WGA, Sigma) was used to stain the fungal cell wall.. . . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis. FRAP analyses was carried out with fungi on cellophane under a spinning disk confocal microscope (UltraVIEW VoX, Perkin Elmer, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK) equipped with a Yokogawa Nipkow CSU-X1 spinning disk scanner, Hamamatsu EMCCD 910013, and Nikon TiE inverted microscope with the Perfect Focus System. We used the UltraVIEW PK Device to photobleach GFP. For the FRAP analyses, the specific region of interest (ROI) covering the entire fluorescence in the ring was selected for bleaching. Twenty bleaching iterations were performed using a 488 laser power of 60%. Image scans were obtained with 15% 488 laser power before and after bleaching. For quantitative analyses, the GFP fluorescence recovery curves were measured as the mean intensity of the ROI pixels, normalized using the using Volocity software (Perkin Elmer), and graphed using Microsoft Excel.. . . . Supporting information. . S1 Fig. . Alignment of the predicted fungal amino acid sequences used in this study.. (A-F) The V. dahliae amino acid sequences were aligned with each sequence of the putative homologs in M. oryzae (Mo) and E. festucae (Ef)/S. cerevisiae (Sc). Sequences were aligned using ClustalX2 and shaded using GeneDoc.

PMC5347015	Temperature is a major environmental sieve selecting plant distribution in temperate and cold climates1. In many complex environments, plants have to cope with temperatures plummeting as low as 30C during winter2. However, most species adapted to these locations have evolved with a suite of protective mechanisms, which are mostly triggered during a brief exposure to low but non-freezing temperature, in light of preparing the plants to further lower temperature, a process termed as cold acclimation3. Understanding the mechanisms of freezing tolerance in plants is of extensive ecological and practical importance. Not only do such studies inform us about the coping strategies plants use to survive freezing in natural conditions, but they also offer great insights to improve the freezing tolerance of many agronomic plants that are susceptible to freezing damage.. Research into identifying the mechanisms by which plants survive low temperature has established a multitude of molecular, biochemical, and physiological changes are involved in making a plant freezing tolerant. One premise is that an array of genes is either up- or down-regulated in response to low temperature456. These waves of changes at the transcript levels expressing or suppressing the genes presumably encompass numerous functions including transcription, signalling, cell wall biogenesis, and synthesis of hormones4. Another line of evidence shows that numerous phytohormones including abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, ethylene and cytokinin play a crucial role in regulating freezing tolerance processes. Whereas the level of ABA in plants increases in the low temperature environment7, auxin8, cytokinin and ethylene9 are mostly down regulated in many species. These changes in phytohormone levels alter gene expression by inducing or preventing the degradation of transcriptional regulators via the ubiquitin-proteasome system10.. In addition, the levels of soluble carbohydrate in many plant tissues are known to increase during low temperature11. These compounds are proposed to serve as cryoprotectants and prevent the freezable water present in cells undergoing a phase change12. Generally, water present in the biological samples forms ice when exposed to low temperature and more than the traceable quantity of ice in the intracellular region is mostly lethal. However, plants mitigate this stress by either holding the water in a supercooled state or limiting the freezing to extracellular spaces and prevent intracellular ice formation (IIF)13. Thus, successful survival of plant organs depends invariably on the ability to avoid IIF.. One of the widely held assumptions is that plants adapted to a cold-environment escape the mortality associated risks of a generative phase by completing the reproduction in summer and shed the seeds before the onset of winter. These seeds subsequently establish soil seed banks and over-winter under dense snow cover before beginning to germinate the next summer1415. Because snow-cover provides a benign environment to the over-wintering seeds, the risk of mortality resulting from ice formation as a consequence of low temperature is minimized16. Therefore, significant attention has been paid to understand the survival strategies of individual plant parts overwintering above the snow cover, e.g. buds, bark or leaves1718. Thus, information on seed survival strategies in a low temperature environment is scant, despite some interest in understanding the tolerance mechanisms of seedlings, mainly due to the assertion that newly germinated seedlings are susceptible to freezing injury in exposed soil surfaces. However, at the time of snow-melt in late winter, seeds in the soil seed banks are hydrated by the melting snow and subsequently exposed to nocturnal temperature plummeting to sub-zero levels. Such events are expected to occur more commonly in the future due to the effects of global warming reducing the duration of snow cover, thereby leaving the seeds exposed to direct low temperature late in winter.. The physiological mechanisms, by which the seeds survive freezing stress have been studied in a few species including Arabidopsis thaliana19, Brassica napus cv. Quest20, Eurotia lanata (Pursh) Moq21, Lactuca sativa222324, Pinus sylvestris25 and Pyrus malus2627. These studies show that imbibed seeds survive low temperature either by freezing avoidance by supercooling or freezing tolerance by extracellular-freezing. In Lactuca sativa, there is evidence to show that the selection of a particular mechanism is related to the rate at which seeds are cooled. At an environmental cooling rate of <4C h1, the seeds survived low temperature by freezing tolerance, whereas at faster cooling rates the seeds undergo supercooling23. However, the putative biochemical and molecular changes in seeds during low temperature survival in the imbibed state remain largely superficial, promoting the need for further investigation.. Here we investigate the biochemical and molecular changes that occur in imbibed seeds when exposed to low temperature. Lactuca sativa has been extensively used as a model species to advance our understanding on the physiological mechanisms operating in imbibed seeds222324. Therefore, we believe this species might be a better candidate for identifying the biochemical and molecular mechanisms. Our specific objectives in this study with imbibed L. sativa seeds were (1) to revisit the physiological mechanisms at different cooling rates; (2) to characterize the biochemical change of imbibed freezing seeds at empirical and ecologically meaningful cooling rates; and (3) to determine the differential molecular changes occurring in seeds under different cooling rates.. . Results. . Seed imbibition and germination. The rate at which moisture of the L. sativa seeds incubated at 21C increased is shown in Fig. 1. The pattern of water absorption is tri-phasic. The seeds absorb water rapidly when they come in contact with water. However, this rapid uptake of water only lasts for some time (from few minutes to few hours depending upon the species). This is usually followed by a slow water uptake phase, loosely termed as lag-phase, where the seeds do not absorb much water, rather use this time to move the hydrated reserved and begin the reactions at molecular levels that require water. Once this phase is completed the radicle begins to emerge, where additional water is absorbed. Seeds of lettuce used in this study began to germinate after 14h and therefore seeds residing above agar at 21C for 12h were considered as fully imbibed (Fig. 1). One hundred percent of the seeds germinated within 5 days, indicating the high viability of the seed lot.. . . Freezing treatment and viability assessment. Germination of fully imbibed seeds declined with decreasing temperature. Seeds cooled at both cooling rates survived to a higher percentage above 15C (Fig. 2). However, none of the fast cooled seeds survived at 20C, compared with 54% survival of the slowly cooled seeds that germinated to normal seedlings when retrieved at 20C (Fig. 2).. . . Electrolyte leakage analysis. No significant difference in electrolyte leakage was found between control and seeds cooled at either cooling rate above 15C (P>0.05; Fig. 3). However, seeds cooled at the faster rate to 20C showed significantly higher leakage than control seeds and slow cooled seeds (P<0.05). The difference in electrolyte leakage between fast and slow cooled seeds became apparent as high as 10C (Fig. 3). Overall, the results indicate that fast cooled seeds suffered significantly higher membrane damage at temperatures between 15 and 20C (Fig. 3).. . . Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity was upregulated by slow cooling treatment at 20C. Imbibed seeds slowly cooled to 20C had significantly higher SOD activity (521.60U/g) than both control (355.54U/g) and fast cooled samples (360.15U/g) (Fig. 4a). However, SOD activity difference was not significant between fast cooled seeds retrieved at 20C and control (P>0.05).. . . Slow cooling caused higher accumulation of free proline at 20C. The free proline based on UV absorbance in seeds fast cooled to 20C did not differ significantly to the seeds prior to cooling (i.e. control) (3.59ug/g FW vs 2.16ug/g FW, P>0.05, Fig. 4b). But a significant induction of free proline was observed in the seeds cooled slowly to 20C (4.60ug/g FW) when compared with control seeds (P<0.05) (Fig. 4b).. . . Soluble sugar content is not related to the freezing tolerance developed in slow cooling treatment. The level of soluble sugar was increased in seeds exposed to low temperature compared with control (Fig. 4c). Although the seeds cooled at 60Ch1 resulted in more levels of sucrose (2.93mg/g FW) compared with seeds cooled at 3Ch1 (2.77mg/g FW), there was no statistically significant difference of sucrose content recorded between two cooling rates (P>0.05).. . . Auxin and ABA expressed significantly higher in slow cooled seeds. Under control condition, the content of ABA was 0.1590.078ug g1 FW, and the IAA content was 0.1250.012ug g1 FW. However, both fast and slow cooling led to significantly higher accumulation of ABA and IAA (P<0.05). In particular, seeds cooled slowly to 20C resulted in significantly higher level of ABA (1.0330.043ug g1 FW for fast cooling vs. 1.4060.13ug g1 FW for slow cooling; P<0.05) and IAA (0.2560.015ug g1 FW for fast cooling vs. 0.4770.027ug g1 FW for slow cooling, P<0.05).. . . RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq analysis conducted on fully imbibed seeds cooled to 20C at two different cooling rates showed that an average of 12,000,000 reads were obtained in each sample (Table 1). We were able to map 65~67% of the total reads to the genome sequences with more than 65% of the total reads uniquely matching and the multi-position matched reads occupied no more than 0.67% (Table 1).. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) varied significantly between the treatments (Fig. 5). There were 1721 DEGs between control and fast cooling treatment, in which 968 were upregulated and 753 were down-regulated. A total of 1987 DEGs were observed between control and slow cooling treatment in which 1089 were upregulated and 898 were down-regulated. However, out of 1735 DEGs between fast and slow cooling treatment, 780 were identified to be upregulated and 955 were down-regulated. Notably, there were 570 DEGs in both fast and slow cooling when compared with control treatment, indicating these were cold responsive genes. Of these 570 DEGs, 11 genes including leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein 4-like and clock regulator Time For Coffee, etc were up-regulated during fast cooling but down-regulated during slow cooling. By contrast, lanC-like protein-2 like down-regulated during fast cooling was up-regulated when seeds were cooled slowly. All the 12 genes expressed in opposite directions between fast and slow cooling are listed in Table 2.. . . Pathway enrichment. There were 1027 DEGs that can be annotated to KEGG pathways between control and slow cooling treatment; 904 between control and fast cooling treatment; 789 between fast and slow cooling treatment. Based on the pathway enrichment results using DEGs, the significant pathways between control, fast and slow cooled treatments can be classified into 4 types (Table 3). Type I is the pathways that differed significantly only in slow cooling based on the comparison with control, and include RNA transport, spliceosome, plant hormone signal, endocytosis, pyrimidine metabolism, and nucleotide excision repair. Type II encompasses pathways that were induced in both cooling treatments but enriched more significantly in slow cooling treatment than fast cooling, and include homologous recombination, DNA replication, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. Type III contains pathways that differed significantly only in fast cooling based on the comparison with control and include alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and fatty acid elongation. Type IV contains pathways that were induced with no difference between the two cooling rates. This type includes protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and plant circadian rhythm. The pathways included in type IV may be the common pathways of both fast and slow cooling treatment.. . . Verification of factors in plant hormone and ubiquitin signal pathways by real time PCR. Pathway enrichment results indicated that both plant hormone and ubiquitin E3 ligase mediated proteolysis were modified during slow cooling treatment compared with fast cooled seeds (Fig. 6). According to RNA-seq, after cooling the imbibed seeds at 3Ch1 to 20C, the transcription of ARF1 was induced, while TIR1 was reduced in fast-cooled seeds. In addition, the transcription of ethylene pathway factors including EBF and EIN2 were reduced, but the ABA pathway gene ABF was induced at 20C (Fig. 6).. We performed real-time PCR to specifically characterize the temperature at which the mRNA level changes for factors of these two pathways by determining the changes after cooling the seeds to 5, 10, 15 and 20C (Figs 7 and 8). During slow cooling, the mRNA level change of above mentioned factors occurred at 20C, and no significant change was evident at 5, 10 and 15C (Fig. 7). However, during fast cooling treatment, although there was no significant mRNA level change for above plant hormone pathway factors at 20C, the mRNA level change of auxin and ethylene pathway related factors including ARF1, TIR1, EIN2, EBF occurred at temperatures as above at 10C. Nevertheless, this increased mRNA level went back to original level at 15C at fast cooling treatment (Fig. 7, Table 4). In contrast, the mRNA level change of ABF occurred at 5C during fast cooling which indicates the faster response of ABA to cooling than auxin and ethylene signals (Table 4). However, the mRNA level of above factors gradually went back to the original level in the seeds cooled to 15C at a fast rate. Although the temperature at which the mRNA level changed varied between cooling rates, the tendency to increase or decrease was the same at both cooling rates. For example, ARF1 and ABF showed positive response while TIR1, EIN2 and EBF showed negative response under both cooling treatments (Fig. 7, Table 4). Moreover, the two auxin-related factors exhibited antagonistic expression in seeds, while EIN2 and EBF exhibited synergistic expression (Fig. 7, Table 4).. The ubiquitin mediated proteolysis pathway (enriched) was significantly different between slow cooling and fast cooling treatments (Table 3). Since SCF has been proven to be involved in plant hormone signal pathways, we detected the duration change of SCF factors including Skp1 and F-BOX (Fig. 8). Both Skp1 and F-BOX were induced by slow cooling treatment according to RNA-seq. The real time PCR verification was consistent with the RNA-seq results (Fig. 6). The peak level of Skp1 existed at 15C during fast cooling and 20C when the seeds were cooled at the slower rate of 3Ch1. The peak level of F-BOX existed at 10C and 20C in fast and slow cooled seeds, respectively. Similar to the factors of plant hormone signal pathway in fast cooling treatment, the expression levels of these factors went back to the original level at later stage(s) (Fig. 8, Table 4).. . . . Discussion. A combination of physiological and molecular events occurred in imbibed L. sativa seeds when exposed to low temperature. Based upon freezing test results, it appears that iceberg lettuce seeds undergo supercooling at the faster cooling rate, but at a slower or more ecologically meaningful cooling rate the seeds develop freezing tolerance by extracellular freeze induced desiccation as a survival mechanism contributing to survival below 15C (Fig. 1). This finding is in accordance with the previous results on several cultivars of lettuce as proposed by Keefe and Moore23. However, this pattern of survival strategy is not universal in seeds because some cultivators of lettuce did not survive 20C regardless of cooling rate2428. Such discrepancy is also found in other seed systems tested, e.g. Pinus sylvestris25. Furthermore, the successful survival of iceberg lettuce seeds by extracellular freezing has a lower limit of around 40C compared with supercooled seeds losing viability at temperatures around 18C29.. From the premise that membrane damage is directly related to the morality of seeds at low temperature30, the results that slow cooled seeds show relatively little or no membrane damage compared with fast cooled seeds when cooled to 20C are of particular interest. The increased electrolyte leakage at 20C during fast cooling corroborate with the mortality of seeds at this temperature suggesting that membrane damage occurred possibly due to the formation of ice in supercooled water disrupting the membranes. However, various biochemical substances produced in seeds are known to protect seeds under low temperature environment. Soluble sugars are present in seeds of many species have been proposed to play an important role in conferring seed survival during stress related to desiccation. When the free water present in the seeds is removed, the sugars actively participate in maintaining the structural integrity of cells and preventing the disruption of cellular structures at a wide-range of temperature up to 196C. In some woody plants, soluble sugars accumulate from autumn to winter which correlated with an increase in freezing tolerance31. Further, it has been reported that cold-acclimation results in increased soluble sugar levels, specifically raffinose and stachyose, which would subsequently increase the freezing tolerance capacity of many plant parts32. However, whether the levels of soluble sugar affect the extent of freezing tolerance in seeds could not be determined due to the small increase in soluble sugar at both cooling rate (Fig. 3). Alternatively, imbibition in seeds may trigger germination events which might increase the soluble sugar levels. Thus, the importance of soluble sugars in freezing tolerance of seeds still awaits more specified investigation.. Nevertheless, the increased amount of SOD activity and proline accumulation during slow cooling indicate these changes likely play a pivotal role in protecting membranes during freezing. The damage of membrane integrity at a low temperature environment is attributed to the phase transition of membrane fatty acids from liquid-crystalline to solid-gel state due to the degradation of lipids by enzymes33. The second set of explanation for membrane damage during low temperature is the stress environment produces free radical and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which affect cellular functions34. Many studies have proposed that SOD will reduce ROS, thus protect membrane during low temperature stress35. Emerging findings also support the importance of free proline in protecting membranes3637. Results of this study strongly suggest that slow cooling induces higher proline accumulation and SOD activity to maintain membrane integrity.. In the recent years, a great deal of attention has been given to identify the genes involved in plant freezing tolerance. In recent years, RNA-seq is becoming a revolutionary tool for investigating the molecular mechanism in a robust way38 and this method has been successfully applied for seed systems39. In the present study, we used RNA-seq to determine the changes of gene expressions occurring in seeds when cooled to 20C. In line with the current understanding of plants and seedlings, our results show that numerous genes and functional pathways were up or down-regulated in imbibed lettuce seeds when moved to low temperature conditions from room temperature (Fig. 5).. Approximately 550 genes changed during both fast and slow cooling indicating that these genes were expressed as a result of low temperature environment. However, 12 of these genes were either up-regulated or down-regulated depending on the cooling rate employed. In this regard, it is of interest to note that leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein 4-like, clock regulator Time For Coffee and a dead-box RNA helicase up-regulated during fast cooling treatment were down-regulated when seeds were cooled slowly. Leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein 4 is a protein related to root morphogenesis and pollen development40, as well as the plant -microbe interaction41. However, there has been no report about the correlation of this gene with low temperature. The TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC) encodes a nuclear regulator in the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clocks42. TIC acts as a negative factor in the JA-signaling pathway which mediates various stress responses43. This is the first study showing the involvement of this gene in cold tolerance, but the interaction of circadian rhythm and cold acclimation has been reported in voluminous studies44. Likewise, One DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase was found to be up- and down-regulated during fast and slow cooling respectively. The DEAD-box helicase is believed to play an important role in cold stress defense in bacteria by the unwinding cold-stabilized secondary structure in the 5-UTR of RNA45. On the other hand, lanC-like protein 2 down-regulated during fast cooling was up-regulated during slow cooling. LanC-like protein 2 is similar to G protein coupled receptor (GCR) 2-like genes. GCR 2 is identified to be the membrane receptor of ABA46. In lettuce, LanC may be the key receptor gene in ABA signal during low temperature stress47.. Our study also focused on relating these genes to functional pathways occurring in imbibed seeds after cooling the seeds at two different cooling rates. Based on pathway enrichment of DEGs of control-fast cooling treatment, control-slow cooling treatment and fast-slow cooling treatment, the significant pathways between fast and slow cooling treatment at 20C can be classified into 4 types, which included pathways enriched in slow cooling or enriched in fast cooling treatment, or both (Table 3). It seems that the regulation of genetic or epigenetic aspects was changed more after slow cooling treatment such as RNA transport, DNA replication and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, while metabolism of small chemicals including alanine, aspartate, glutamate metabolism and fatty acid elongation were induced more during fast cooling. There are reports about the cold response of RNA processing including RNA splicing, export and secondary structure unwinding in plants48 and the induction of Ala, Asp and Glu under cold stress49. However, it remains unknown at this time, whether sudden temperature plummetleads to cytoplasmic biochemical change at lower sub-zero temperature while the slow cooling leads to gene expression change in the nucleus.at the same point.. Pathway enrichment based on RNA-seq indicated that plant hormones including ABA, auxin, and ethylene are believed to be an important regulator of cold stress response8. Ubiquitination also plays a significant role in cold acclimation50. The two factors in auxin pathway including ARF1 and TIR1 are the targets of miR393 which is involved in cold stress51. Ethylene pathway factors EBF and EIN2 are known to involve in fruit ripening disorder caused by chilling injury52. ABF is an important regulator in ABA response pathway. ABF/ABA-responsive element binding protein (AREB) are basic region leucine zipper (bZIP)-type DNA-binding proteins that regulate the expression of Cor (Cold Responsive)/Lea genes that contain cis-acting elements ABA-responsive element (ABREs) in their promoters53. F-box and Skp1 are components of E3 ligase. However, there has been no report about the involvement of Skp1 and F-box in cold response. Nevertheless, based on our RNA-seq results, Skp1 and F-box were up-regulated at 20C after slow freezing. How Skp1 and F-box are involved in freezing tolerance of seeds remains an open area to be investigated in the future.. To date, most of the freezing tolerance studies on physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in plants have focused on plant tissues and there have been no in-depth studies available on seed systems (see Introduction). Whilst, it is clear that the mechanisms involved in plants vary with species or plant parts under investigation, several new pathways that are identified here to involve in seed freezing tolerance123. A direct comparison of these mechanisms with the known information plant systems seems less plausible. However, from our results, it appears that there are specific changes occurring at molecular level in the seed systems (Figs 7 and 8). The non-enrichment of plant hormone pathway in fast freezing treatment observed by RNA-seq was probably a consequence of quick response of seeds to these events. Thus, most of the molecular changes occurred at higher sub-zero temperatures in fast cooled seeds. Based on this evidence, we suggest that a sudden cold shock stimulates all these changes when the temperature around seeds is rapidly reduced. By contrast, seeds do not undergo any changes at higher sub-zero temperature when the drop in temperature was slow at a more ecologically meaningful rate, presumably sensing the temperature change is a temporary stress. However, when the temperature was reduced to critical levels of 15C, a sudden burst of changes occurs (Figs 7 and 8), which contributes to seed survival at the slower cooling rate. Thus, similar to the physiological mechanisms, seeds have evolved with specific biochemical and molecular mechanisms to protect freezing stress that are specifically affected by cooling rate. Nevertheless, the significance of differential timing for regulation of above factors at different cooling rates demands special emphasis in the future studies.. . . Methods. . Seed materials and germination. Seeds of Lactuca sativa cv. Iceberg were purchased from a retail outlet and stored at 15% RH and 15C prior to experimentation. The initial germination level was determined by sowing four replicates of 25 seeds on 1% agar-water in Petri dishes. The Petri dishes were incubated at 211C constant temperature with 16/8h light/dark regime with a light intensity of c. 30mol m2s1. The seeds were deemed to have germinated when the radicle had emerged by 2mm or more.. . . Seed imbibition and moisture content. Ten replicates of 25 seeds were imbibed on 1% agar-water in Petri dishes one Petri dish was sampled every 8hours for moisture content determination for 80h. Moisture content was determined gravimetrically by oven drying at 103C for 17h and expressed on a fresh weight basis throughout. The time at which the first germination took place was also recorded. Whenever, imbibed seeds were used in the experiments, the seeds took water for 12hours (see results).. . . Freezing tests. Fully imbibed, but non-germinated seeds (see Fig. 1) were surface dried by placing them between soft tissue pads. These seeds were loaded in cryovials and cooled in a programmable freezer at 60C or 3C h1 to the terminal temperature of 20C. Viability assessments were made by sampling three replicates of 25 seeds at each 5C interval and germinating them under conditions described above.. . . The relative electrolyte leakage (REL) assay. REL analysis was conducted in imbibed seeds with both non-freezing treatments and cooled to 5, 10, 15 and 20C at fast and slower rates using a method described by Chowhan et al.54. Briefly, 0.5g seeds were added into the 50ml-tubes with 5mL deionized water, then mixed thoroughly by placing the tubes in a shaker (Kylin-Bell Lab Instruments Co. Ltd., Jiangsu, China) for 2h before measuring the electrolyte leakage (EL) using a conductivity meter (Cold-Parmer, USA). EL was also measured after boiling the tubes with contents for 30min. REL was expressed as the ratio of initial to final conductivity. De-ionised water was used as a control. The experiment is replicated twice and the values are presented as average.. . . Detection of soluble sugar changes by HPLC. Previous studies on lettuce, and data collected in the present investigation (see results) indicate that supercooling ability is generally lost in the region of 18C; therefore, any molecular change contributing to the survival of seeds is expected to occur at temperatures above 20C. Consequently, we hypothesized cooling seeds to 20C could serve as an appropriate threshold for studying the importance of soluble sugar content. To determine the sugar level changes, imbibed seeds were cooled separately at 60C or 3Ch1 to 20C in a programmable freezer. These seeds were ground in a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The powder was homogenized by adding an equal volume of 80% ethanol and incubated at 50C for 20min. The homogenate was then centrifuged for 30min at 3000rpm and the supernatant was collected and the remaining pellets were washed with 80% ethanol and re-centrifuged. This process was repeated thrice and all the supernatants collected were mixed. The ethanol in the supernatant was removed with a rotary vacuum evaporator at 50C. The remaining liquid was filtered with a 0.45uM microporous filter membrane (Millipore, USA). The filtrate was diluted 10 fold by adding ddH2O and analyzed by HPLC with a Waters Associates Liquid Chromatograph (Milford, MA, USA), equipped with an isocratic1525 pump, U6 K injector. Sucrose was detected with a 2414 differential refractometer. The immobile phase was A P S- H Y P E R S IL (4.6mm250mm) and the mobile phase was acetonitrile: water (80:20) at a flow rate of 0.8ml/min at room temperature. The volume of injection was 10uL. The standard samples were prepared as follows: the sucrose samples were dried at 105C for 5hr and 0.5g sample was dissolved in water and diluted to 1, 2, 5, 10mg/ml, respectively and filtered with a 0.45uM membrane (Millipore, USA).. . . Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) assay. Total SOD activity was measured following the method described by according to Beyer and Fridovich55. The total SOD activity was detected in imbibed seeds with non-freezing treatment (control) and imbibed seeds cooled to 20C under both the cooling rates. The total SOD activity was assayed photochemically based on the inhibition of NBT reduction by superoxide radicals. One unit of SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme required to inhibit the reduction rate of NBT by 50% at 25C.. . . Free proline assay. Free proline was extracted using the method developed by Bates et al.56. Imbibed seeds with non-freezing treatment (using as control) and imbibed seeds cooled to 20C under both the cooling rates were ground and mixed with 5ml of 3% aqueous sulfosalicyclic acid. The mixture was boiled for 10min and centrifuged at 12000rpm for 10min. The discarded supernatant was subsequently mixed with 2ml acid-ninhydrin and 2ml glacial acetic acid. After boiling for 10min, the reaction mixture was extracted with 4ml toluene by centrifugation for 5min at 3000rpm. Then the absorbance was measured at 515nm using NANO DROP2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). Standard curves were made using 2ml standard solutions of proline with different concentration, prior to sample measurement.. . . ABA and IAA content assay. ABA and IAA was extracted by modified method of the previous report57. Briefly, two grams of seeds in fresh weight were grounded into powder. Add 20ml 80% methanol and shaked overnight at 4C. Then the extracting solution was evaporated to a volume of 4ml and extracted by chloroform and ethyl acetate seperately. The extracting solution was evaporated to be dry and the extracts was dilluted by methanol. ABA was detected by HPLC and IAA was detected by LC-MS based on the previous method57.. . . Determination of molecular changes in freezing seeds using RNA-seq analysis. To unravel the molecular changes occurring in seeds during low temperature, RNA-seq analysis was performed in BGI company (Shenzhen, China) using imbibed seeds (control) and after cooling seeds to 20C at 60C or 3Ch1. For RNA extraction, seeds cooled to 20C were ground using a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The samples were first treated with DNase I to degrade any possible DNA contamination and the mRNA was enriched by using oligo (dT) magnetic beads on the ice. The mRNA was then sliced into short fragments by mixing the sample with fragmentation buffer. Using the short fragments, we synthesized the first strand of cDNA by using random hexamer-primer. Later, Buffer, dNTPs, RNase H and DNA polymerase I were added to synthesize the second strands. The double strand cDNA was purified with magnetic beads. End reparation and 3-end single nucleotide A (adenine) addition was then performed. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments. The fragments were enriched by PCR amplification. During the quality control step, Agilent 2100 Bioanaylzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System were used to qualify and quantify the sample library, which was sequenced via Illumina HiSeqTM 2000.. Data filtering was carried out to obtain high quality reads as the clean reads including removing reads with adaptor sequences, removing reads in which the percentage of unknown bases (N) was greater than 10%, and removing low quality reads. If the percentage of the low quality base (base with quality value 5) was greater than 50% in a read, we define this read as low quality. Clean reads were mapped to reference sequences and/or reference gene set using SOAPaligner/SOAP258. No more than 2 mismatches were allowed in the alignment. The expression level for each gene was determined by the numbers of reads uniquely mapped to the specific gene and the total number of uniquely mapped reads in the sample. Briefly, the gene expression level was calculated by reads Per kb Million reads (RPKM) method.. The probability of gene A expressed equally between fast and slow cooled samples was calculated as equation (1):. . . . . . where, N1 is the number of total clean tags of the fast cooled sample, N2 is the number of total clean tags of slowly cooled sample, x is the number of tags held by gene A in slowly cooled sample, and y is the number of tags held by gene A in the slow cooled sample.. The calculated P-value corresponds to differential gene expression. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to determine the threshold of P value in multiple tests. We used FDR 0.001 and the absolute value of log2Ratio 1 as the threshold to judge the significance of gene expression difference.. To classify the function of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathway enrichment analysis was performed by mapping the DEGs to KEGG database59, using the formula described by Hooper and Brok60. Briefly, this involves calculating gene numbers for every term, then using the hypergeometric test to find significantly enriched terms in DEGs. The following equation (2) was used to map the DEGs to KEGG database:. . . . . . where N is the number of all genes with KEGG annotation, n is the number of DEGs in N, M is the number of all genes annotated to specific pathways, and m is the number of DEGs in M. The calculated P value was tested for statistical significance using Bonferroni correction, at P=0.05.. . . Verification by real time PCR. The RNAseq displayed a wave of changes occurring at 20C in both fast and slow cooled seeds (see results). To understand the temperature at which these changes occur in imbibed seeds at two different cooling rates, we verified the sequencing by extracting total RNA from imbibed seeds after cooling to 5, 10, 15, 20C at 60C or 3Ch1. The samples were ground with a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The powdered seeds were treated with RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa) and cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (Prime Script RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser, Takara, Japan). Real time PCR was performed with PrimeScript RT reagent Kit and gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time) (Takara, Japan) by ABI7900 system (ABI, USA). The conditions were as follows: 1 cycle for degeneration at 94C (3min), 40 cycles at 94C (20s), 52C (20s), 72C (20s) for amplification and 1 cycle for elongation at 72C (7min). Three replicates were carried out. The sequences of primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1.. . . Statistical analysis. Percentage germination of seeds after cooling at 60C and 3Ch1 to specific low temperature was compared using a t-test. The different groups of REL, SOD, proline and soluble sugars data of control, fast cooled and slow cooled seeds were tested for statistical significance by one-way ANOVA independently. We used LSD post-hoc test to find significant differences between groups.. . . . Additional Information. How to cite this article: Jaganathan, G. K. et al.

PMC5344921	Introduction. For millennia, our species has tried to control the environment around us to facilitate our activities. This has led to technological inventions from housing to space-probes that (crash) land on a different planet. Yet, when it comes to living organisms, our control over their behaviors has only been partial. Initial works have been done using small molecules to activate or inhibit (hopefully) single cellular functions. Later on, gene augmentation or elimination has been the focus of much of cell biology, as well as transgenic and knockout (KO) models, for the last two decades. With this, we have attempted to understand what occurs when a gene is inhibited/removed, or if we can influence the phenotype of cells or organisms by adding or exchanging genes (knock-in, KI) (Figure 1).. . Figure 1. . Traditional ways to study organisms, either by introducing or deleting genes and expecting phenotypical changes. (A) An analogy using a car as a complex system, where changes in the components of the car by adding (transgenic, TG), deleting (KO) or replacing/repairing (KI) parts (representing genes). Can we one day use parts to create a whole?; (B) The main reason why we would like to control living systems is to control how one cell behaves and in this way, determine what it does e.g. differentiation. The tools to achieve such fates are only beginning to come of age.. . . . Although, these experiments have produced a trove of valuable data, it can be considered as just the first steps to real control of phenotypical changes. A novel branch of molecular biology, called synthetic biology, has stepped in by providing a suite of innovative tools that enable an unprecedented control of cellular processes, and eventually organisms. Synthetic biology mainly involves the rational design and engineering of novel biological devises, or systems, by coupling different biological parts or modules (Kelwick et al., 2014).. In this review, some of the most innovative tools for the detailed manipulation of cellular processes are presented, discussing their advantages and disadvantages, as well as their potential translational application to multicellular organisms which would be the final goal.. . . Right to assemble. Cells systematically use protein assembly or dissociation as cues to perform the most complex of biological functions. Therefore, the manipulation of protein-protein interactions is essential for the development of any cell controlling system.. Since proteins are the workhorses of cells, these have been the main focus of most of the research involving control of cellular behavior. Proteins interact with each other, as well as with other components of the cell, which is done in an incredibly active manner. Virtually all cellular processes involve the formation of protein complexes, frequently involving RNA, DNA, and/or other biological molecules, too.. . Location, location, location. One of the most important factors affecting protein function is localization. Where the protein locates determines its interaction partners and thus its functions. Cells sort proteins using a series of encoded signal peptides (or localization signals) within the protein, analogous to postcodes, that determine where the protein should be transported e.g., to the nucleus, to mitochondria, to the cell membrane, or to be secreted. Signal peptides were first described by Gnter Blobel and Bernhard Dobberstein in a landmark paper (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975) that eventually lead to the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine for Blobel in 1999.. The modification of these signals results in changes in the localisation of proteins and hereby their functions. This can be used to our advantage, for example localization signals can be added to exogenous proteins (usually encoded in a plasmid) so their localisation is predetermined. Adding a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to virtually any protein would result in protein re-routing to the cell nucleus. The reverse process is also possible, using nuclear export signal (NES) to export a protein out of the nucleus. Having both NLS/NES will result in the protein being shuttled between cytoplasm and the nucleus.. Likewise, mitochondrial targeting signals (MTS) have been used to attach proteins to the mitochondria's outer membrane for many different reasons, e.g., to label mitochondria by use of fluorescent proteins (FPs) or sequestering proteins to the mitochondria membrane (see below).. Experimental swapping of localization signals are impressive tools to study protein function as shown in the following study. Cytoskeleton remodeling proteins Ena (Mammalian Enabled Homolog) and VASP (Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein) are cytosolic proteins often found in focal adhesions and leading edge of fibroblasts, and so assumed to play crucial roles in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton that promote cell motility. Using localisation signals, Bear and collaborators studied Ena or VASP by either sequestering onto the mitochondrial outer membrane or directing them to the cell membrane, thus to the vicinity of focal adhesions, of fibroblasts. Against all expectations, Ena/VASP sequestration resulted in cytoskeleton remodeling and increased cell motility, whereas constitutive cell membrane localization reduced motility (Bear et al., 2000). This study highlights the importance of detailed experimentation at the molecular level to unravel cellular functions.. Localization can be used to bring proteins together or to separate them. For example, we found an extremely rare mutation in the gene that codes for a secreted protein, the luteinising hormone beta (LHB), in a patient. To prove that the wildtype (WT) and mutant proteins were expressed at the same level, but only the mutant was intracellularly retained, we fused the LHB to mCherry fluorescent protein, for tracking, and to (NLS)AmCyan via a 2A peptide. The 2A peptide is a self-cleaving peptide the separates the two proteins assuring both are expressed at equal concentrations. While the WT LHB-mCherry was normally secreted, and only visible inside secretion vesicles, the mutant was intracellularly retained. Nuclear-AmCyan was then used to quantify for equal expression (Potorac et al., 2016).. A drawback of localization signals is their uncontrollability. Therefore, the next section is about additional modifications used to manipulate protein localization.. The discovery that small compounds can either induce the dimerization or stabilization of some proteins, has prompted their use to regulate protein-protein interactions or protein levels in the cell, respectively.. . . The chemistry between us. One of the best well-described methods where a small compound triggers protein dimerization involves rapamycin, a macrolide antifungal antibiotic from Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Originally, rapamycin was found to form a functional complex with the FKBP protein (FK506-binding protein, aka FKBP12), a complex that specifically binds, and inhibits, the mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1). The mTOR's domain, which directly interacts with rapamycin-FKBP moiety, was named FRB (FKBPrapamycin binding domain of mTOR) (Chung et al., 1992; Sigal and Dumont, 1992). The reciprocal affinity of these two rapamycin-binding domains (FKBP and FRB) has been underpinned for the development of chemical-inducible dimerization (CID) (Banaszynski et al., 2005), where two proteins of interest (POI) or two complementing fragments of a protein, are each fused to either FKBP or FRB and thereby can be united by addition of rapamycin (Figure 2A). Below we describe a couple of well-designed applications on how CID has been used to understand and control cellular functions.. . Figure 2. . Chemical-induced dimerization and protein stabilization. (A) The FKBP/FRB system based on rapamycin-induced protein dimerization. This system brings two protein, or two complementing fragments, together, when one is fused to FKBP and the second to FRB in the presence of rapamycin (Rapa). (B) The fusion of a destabilizing domain (DD) to a protein of interest (POI) leads to its rapid degradation by the proteasome. However, in the presence of a suitable ligand [Shield1 for FKBP or Trimethoprim (TMP) for DHFR] the DD is stabilized and the POI accumulates in the cell.. . . . During the last checkpoint in mitosis, M or spindle checkpoint, one of the most sophisticated protein complexes in the cell is meticulously assembled. The complex ensures that the sister chromatids are aligned and attached to the microtubule spindles via kinetochores. Once kinetochores are correctly attached to the spindle, the checkpoint is inactivated by protein dissociation and cell division can furthermore proceed. In order to determine which of the checkpoint proteins are able to reactivate the checkpoint, Ballister, Riegman, and Lampson used CID to temporarily re-localize checkpoint proteins to the kinetochore. They fused the mitotic association protein Mis12, a component of the kinetochore, with FKBP and green FP (GFP), and FRB was fused to mCherry and checkpoint Mad1 protein. In the presence of rapamycin, Mad1 was recruited into the kinetochore, as visualized by GFP/mCherry, triggering the reactivation of the mitotic checkpoint to confirm that Mad1 is a crucial checkpoint component (Ballister et al., 2014; Ballister and Lampson, 2016).. Fusing FRB and FKBP domains, surprisingly, does not result in a molecular clamp in the presence of rapamycin, instead it forms FRB-FKBP tetramers: where the FKBP of one moiety dimerises with the FRB of another, occurring thrice more, the last FKBP binds to the first FRB. The cellular gatekeeper p53 plays essential roles in cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair by regulation of the expression of hundreds of genes. A tetrameric conformation of p53 is required to bind to target DNA, which is normally achieved via a tetrameric domain. Therefore, the DNA binding domain of p53 was fused to FRB-FKBP. Upon addition of rapamycin, the engineered p53 tetramerised and activated target genesan inducible p53 for detailed studies in p53's tumor suppression functions (Inobe et al., 2015).. The FKBP/FRB dimerization has been widely used, more in-depth examples can also be found in the following reviews (Putyrski and Schultz, 2012; DeRose et al., 2013; Feng and Arnold, 2016). A drawback in the use of rapamycin is that it targets mTOR which is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism (Li et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2016).. Exploiting CID plus delocalization, Robinson and colleagues generated a technique they named knocksideways (a British expression meaning to take by surprise) where FRB is anchored to the outer membrane of the mitochondria via a mitochondria targeting signal (MTS). FRB-MTS functions as a trap for FKBP-fused proteins in the presence of rapamycinsequestering proteins away from their site of action. Using knocksideways the authors sequestered the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), normally recruited to endocytotic vesicles, and demonstrated that clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin requires AP-2 (Robinson et al., 2010). Knocksideways is able to control a cellular process by temporarily sequestering key molecular components.. While this procedure is fast and allows immediate removal of molecular players, avoiding compensations common in long knockdown (silencing) or knockout (KO) experiments, it requires the removal, by silencing or KO, of the endogenous POI, or more sophisticatedly a knock-in (KI), inserting FKBP as a fusion tag to the endogenous gene of interest. Although this domain could be easily adapted to exogenous proteins in synthetic biology, the side effects of rapamycin are an issue nevertheless.. . . An act of disappearance and reappearance. Protein turnover is determined by its degradation ratemostly performed by the proteasome. Misfolded or aged proteins are labeled with a small protein tag called ubiquitin by ubiquitin ligase, then such ubiquitinated proteins are mostly routed to the proteasome for rapid degradation (Hershko et al., 1980).. The first system based on the control of protein stability was reported in the middle of the 90s. A mutant of mammalian dihydrofolate reductase bearing an N-terminal arginine (Arg-DHFR), was shown to be unstable at 37C but stable at lower temperatures (~23C) in yeast (Dohmen et al., 1994; Lvy et al., 1999). Interestingly, addition of the DHFR inhibitor, methotrexate, partially protected Arg-DHFR from degradation (Lvy et al., 1999), which was suggested as a potential method to control protein degradation.. Subsequently, the laboratory of Thomas Wandless developed two destabilization domains (DDs), that are rapidly destabilized and degraded by the proteasome. The first is a 107 residues long (12-kDa) FKBP derivative (DD-FKBP) which is stabilized by a ligand, named morpholino-containing ligand (Shield-1) (Banaszynski et al., 2006; Haugwitz et al., 2008). The second was based on the Arg-DHFR, but instead, using prokaryotic E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) mutants that were engineered to be unstable in the absence, but stabilized in the presence, of the cell-permeable prokaryotic-DHFR inhibitor trimethoprim (TMP) (Iwamoto et al., 2010; Figure 2B).. DD-FKBP/Shield-1 and DD-ecDHFR/TMP have been used in living cells and animal models (An et al., 2015) including the accumulation of a reporter DD-yellow fluorescent protein (DD-YFP) in the brain of rats, transduced by a lentivirus, after TMP was administrated in drinking water (Iwamoto et al., 2010; Tai et al., 2012). Moreover, with the use of DD-ecDHFR/TMP, Quintino and collaborators were able to control the level of glial cells-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a protein that exerts neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on dopamine neurons, in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease (Quintino et al., 2013) confirming the great therapeutic potential of GDNF against Parkinson's disease.. TMP has several advantages: it acts on prokaryotic ecDHFR with virtually no effect on mammalian DHFR, has low toxicity, and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, these two systems (DD-FKBP/Shield-1 and ecDHFR/TMP) can be used orthogonally, and both inhibitors do not seem to have any major side effects in animal models. The cell specificity in vivo could be achieved by using tissue-specific promoters; further, protein accumulation is reversible. Conversely, DDs are large proteins that can cause secondary structural effects to the fused protein, the accumulation kinetics will be strongly influenced by gene expression and inhibitor doses, and they cannot be regulated at the subcellular level.. All abovementioned systems are based in the stabilization of domains that otherwise destine the fusion protein for degradation. Can a protein be removed at will? The auxin-inducible degron (AID) was originally discovered in plants (Nishimura et al., 2009) and subsequently optimized for mammalian cells (Fallis, 2009; Morawska and Ulrich, 2013). Auxins, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), function as hormones regulating gene expression in plants (Fallis, 2009). Proteins having an AID tag are normally expressed, yet, in the presence of IAA, they interact with F-box protein TIR1, an interaction that triggers ubiquitination by E3 ligase and consequently proteasomal degradation (Morawska and Ulrich, 2013) in 0,52 h (Zhang et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2016). AID has also been successfully adapted to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where the main component of AID, TIR1, was expressed under the control of different promoters to drive tissue- and stage-specific expression. While the AID tag was introduced into endogenous nuclear hormone receptors nhr-23 and nhr-25 genes, as well as meiosis-specific gene dhc-1 (dynein heavy chain) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (see below). Upon addition of auxin both of the nuclear receptors were dynamically removed, demonstrating that the decrease of NHR-25 receptor produced larval arrest, molting defects and gonads abnormalities, whereas auxin-induced NHR-23 depletion was associated with larval arrest only. Auxin-induced degradation of DHC-1 protein exerted defects in chromosome synapsis, included global disorganization of germline nuclei and defects in oocyte maturation in Caenorhabditis, which proves its crucial role in meiosis (Zhang et al., 2015).. Ongoing efforts to develop more potent auxin agonists are on the way, although the properties of IAA (water solubility, size, low toxicity, and a low cost) may prove difficult to improve upon. The need of small molecules in all chemical-induced systems, produces a series of challenges for translation to in vivo. These small molecules should not interact with other cellular components, have minimal-to-none toxicity and immunogenicity, and should be delivered to all tissues, or, in some cases, to specific tissues. An additional challenge for most small molecules is to pass through the blood-brain or blood-testis barriers.. . . . The first-light on optogenetics. Expectedly, plants, algae and bacteria have proteins that respond to light. Indeed, even animals have proteins that respond to lightsuch as the opsin receptors. Although, in animal opsins receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) while in microorganisms opsin receptors are ion channels instead. The pioneer of these ion receptors, cloned from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, was channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). This cation channel was customized to mammalian cells, proving its functionality by transfecting neurons and exposing them to blue-light (470 nm), which induced polarization by admitting sodium in Nagel et al. (2003) and Boyden et al. (2005). This was followed by the Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin (NpHR) chloride pump (Zhang et al., 2007), a yellow-light sensing receptor (589 nm), which allows chlorine ions into cells, enabling to turn firing neurons off (Figure 3A).. . Figure 3. . Light-sensing ion pumps. (A) The photosensitive channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR) ion channels expressed in neurons allow the polarization of the cells by sodium (Na+) or chloride (Cl) influx. (B) Using these light-activated rhodopsins, it has been possible to control the responses of animal models to e.g., elicit defensive behaviors in mice (see text for details).. . . . The immediate success of these receptors, prompted a search in plants, fungi, bacteria and algae for novel proteins that are able to react to light. What has been found so far is a fascinating collection of proteins that change function upon light activation. Due to the characteristics of light, these light-sensing proteins respond to different wavelengths, some of them only to short wavelength windows while others respond distinctively to different light hues.. As a proof of concept, ChR2, NpHR, and a new red-light (566 nm) activated protein pump, Arch (archaerhodopsin; Chow et al., 2010), were introduced into the brains of mice using Cre-conditional adeno-associated viral vectors, in which Cre recombinase (see Box 3) expression was controlled by neuron-type specific promoters: parvalbumin for expression in GABAergic interneurons, and somatostatin for expression in basolateral amygdala principal neurons. Only the parvalbumin- or somatostatin-positive cells developed light sensitivity to the correct wavelength. In this manner, the authors managed to control the activation of fear memory without a conditioned stimulusin this case, a sound associated with a footshockor inhibited fear responses upon auditory stimulation (Wolff et al., 2014). In a separate study, the photosensitive ChR2 and NpHR ion channels were expressed in the cortical amygdala neurons of mice under the control of the arc promoterspecific to these neurons. Activation of the cortical amygdala neurons by odors secreted by predators, such as TMT (2,4,5 dihydro 2,5 trimethylthiazoline), produce defensive behavior in mice. Light-activation of NpHR silenced the olfactory bulb and suppressed the aversion to TMT, while ChR2 activation induced the defensive response in the absence of TMT (Figure 3B). With this, the authors demonstrated that, by optogenetical affecting the neural circuit that transmits information from the olfactory bulb to cortical amygdala, they can control the innate behavior of animals (Root et al., 2014).. Neurons are not alone to respond to an influx of ions, muscle cells respond by contracting upon sodium influx. Based on this, Park et al. layered ChR2-expressing cardiomyocytes in a serpentine pattern on a ray fish-shaped elastomer with a gold skeletonto retract to the original shape, in an attempt to create prototypes for organ bioengineering. Photoactivation triggered sequential muscular contractions, creating undulatory phototactic locomotion of this biorobot (it swam in direction to light!) (Park et al., 2016).. Since red-light has a better tissue penetrance, is less absorbed by blood, and does not appear to interfere with normal visual function, a green-light-responding channelrhodopsin from Volvox carteri has been engineered to respond to orange-to-red wavelengths (590630 nm) (Lin et al., 2013). This red-activatable Channelrhodopsin (ReaChR), when expressed in gustatory neurons, was used for the precise regulation of male courtship song of freely moving adult Drosophila flies, to discover a two neuronal-regulated command-like components (Inagaki et al., 2014).. For more detailed focused reviews, refer to the following reviews (Rein and Deussing, 2012; Tischer and Weiner, 2014; Guru et al., 2015).. Other non-membranous optogenetic proteins shall be described below, following presentation of a different approach to rationally generate light-responding membrane receptors, now based on the structural similarities between mammalian light-sensing receptors (opsins) - GPCRs themselves - and other GPCRs.. . Light my pathway. . Direct light-activation of GPCRs. GPCRs, all 7 serpentine transmembrane receptors that take a barrel-like conformation, are the largest family of receptors in vertebrates. Controlling these receptors is therefore an important area of interest to understand cell communication. The challenge was to generate receptors that are triggered by light, but transduce predetermined signaling pathways. To this end, Airan and collaborators rationally designed chimeric receptors where they kept the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the Gt-coupled bovine green-absorbing rhodopsin and exchanged the intracellular loopsreponsible for G protein coupling - to those of either Gq-coupled human alpha 1 (1AR) or Gs-coupled hamster beta 1 (2AR) adrenoceptors. The resulting receptors, named optoXRs, proved able to activate the expected intercellular pathway upon light activation: opto-1AR activated Gq-responsive adenylate cyclase and downstream cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), while opto-2AR activated Gs-activation of phospholipase C led to the second messenger inositol triphosphate (IP3) (Figure 4). These optoXRs only triggered biased-intracellular cascades, showing that endogenous modules can be incorporated into synthetic systems (Airan et al., 2009).. . Figure 4. . Controlling GPCR signaling by photoactivation. By interchanging the intracellular domains (loops) of the Gt-coupled bovine green-absorbing rhodopsin receptor for either the Gq-coupled human alpha 1 adrenogenic receptor (1AR) (red), or Gs-coupled hamster beta 1 adrenogenic receptor (2AR) (violet), it is possible to activate single downstream pathways upon light activation: opto-1AR activates adenylate cyclase and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production while opto-2AR activates phospholipase C leads to increase inositol triphosphate (IP3).. . . . . . Secondary metabolites. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a common secondary metabolite downstream GPCR activation, which transduces intracellular signaling by activating kinases and ion channels. Therefore, cAMP control is an important cell communication signaling molecule. To date, two photo-activatable enzymes, one that produces and one that degrades cAMP, have been reported. The first is the microbial photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (bPAC) from Beggiatoa which was found to increase 300-fold in cyclase activity (cAMP production) under 405 nm light, as compared to its non-stimulated state, in E. coli, Xenopus oocytes, and Drosophila neurons. In the latter it produced efficient light-induced depolarization and behavioral changes (Stierl et al., 2011). Light-inducible bPAC has also been used to rescue the function of rodent sperm that lack endogenous SACY (soluble adenylyl cyclase)an essential cAMP-signaling component required for motility and capacitation of sperm (Jansen et al., 2015).. Degrading cAMP is as important as producing it for cell signaling responses, a task that is achieved by phosphodiesterases. With such aim, and with the use of in silico protein modeling, Gasser and collaborators noticed a strong structural similarity between the PDE domain of dimeric human phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A) and red-light responsive dimeric PhyB (see below) of Deinococcus radiodurans. By superimposing PhyB to PDE2A, they bioengineered a red-light-activating phosphodiesterase (LAPD), a chimera that hydrolyses up-to 6-fold more cAMP/cGMP upon light absorption in cell cultures or in zebrafish embryos. PhyB's photo-activated state can be reversed by far-red light (~700 nm), a feature that remains in LAPD. In addition, this red-light-PDE2A uses endogenous biliverdin as chromophore (Gasser et al., 2014), unlike PhyB which utilizes phycocyanobilin (see below).. Since bPAC and LAPD are activated by different wavelengths they can be used to fine-tune control of secondary metabolite signaling both in vitro and in vivo.. . . . Photosensing below the surface: non-membranous proteins. Abovementioned is that the discovery of optogenetic channels provoked a search for other proteins that respond to light, here are some of the best described.. Light oxygen voltage (LOV) is a small domain found in the N- or C-termini of some proteins from plants, fungi and some bacteria that responds to either of these three stimulations. There are two subclasses: modular LOV and short LOV (sLOV) (Crosson et al., 2003).. LOV domains were first identified in plant phototropins (LOV1 and LOV2) but also found conjugated to some regulatory proteins of circadian rhythms, phosphodiestrases, kinases, ubiquitin ligases, and DNA-binding proteins (Crosson et al., 2003). The first sLOVs identified were found in the YtvA protein of Bacillus subtilis (Losi et al., 2002). Homology sequence comparisons uncovered similar domains in proteins from different chemotropic and autotrophic prokaryotes (Jentzsch et al., 2009). Interestingly, the mechanism of action of LOV domain is conserved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (Jentzsch et al., 2009). LOV proteins have an important role in plant growth, development, regulation of circadian clock, stress response and adaptation, as well as in bacterial phototropism and cell-cell attachment (Lokhandwala et al., 2016).. The LOV domains found in many species were hypothesized to be responsible for sensing light, oxygen and/or voltage. Eventually, the N-terminal region of the Arabidopsis' nph1 was shown to contain a ~100 amino acid region highly conserved in many other sensor proteins (Huala et al., 1997). The LOV domain of nph1 from oat (Avena sativa) (AsLOV) was subsequently proven to be the photoactivatable domain of nph1 (Christie et al., 1999). The molecular mechanism involves photon absorption by a covalent bond between flavin cofactor (riboflavin, FMN or FAD) and a conserved cysteine residue, which remains stable for several seconds. This interaction leads to conformational changes and unwinding (undocking) of the C-terminal (J) helix (Wu et al., 2009).. In practice, LOV domains can be coupled to a protein of interest, usually in proximity to signal or functional domains, to conceal them by the folding structure of the LOV domain. Upon irradiation, the J helix is undocked and the signal or functional region exposed (Lokhandwala et al., 2016; Figure 5A). Combining a LOV domain adjacent to a localisation signal results in cytoplasmic localization, which upon light activation exposes the localization signal triggering re-localization (Yumerefendi et al., 2016). Several variants of this technique exist, such as LEXY, LINuS, LANS or LINX which consist of the concealment of nuclear export (NES) or/and nuclear localization (NLS) signals by LOV2, respectively (Niopek et al., 2014, 2016; Di Ventura and Kuhlman, 2016; Wehler et al., 2016; Yumerefendi et al., 2016). All of these modifications are short and genetically encoded domains that can be joined at the C- or N- terminus of proteins of interest (Wehler et al., 2016).. . Figure 5. . Structure and function of LOV. (A) The light/oxygen/voltage (LOV) domain is composed by a core and a helical domain called the Ja helix. Together they sandwich a flavin molecule in dark conditions. Upon light activation the Ja helix undocks. The LOV domain has been harnessed to cage signal peptides or functional domains of enzymes. (B) Organelle transport by LOV (mitochondria). A mitochondria-localized LOV domain caging a small peptide (LOVpep) that upon light exposure is exposed and bound by an engineered PDZ domain (ePDZ). By fusing ePDZ with motor protein kinesin, it is possible to control the translocation of mitochondria along microtubules in the axons of neurons. (C) Light-control on migration: In dark the LOV domain sterically blocks a constitutively-active Rac1. Uncaging Ja helix by light exposes Rac1 to its effector protein, triggering actin filament polymerisation and stimulated cell movement in the direction of the cell's illuminated edge.. . . . Beyond protein re-localization, although important as described above, the LOV domain has been adapted to the regulation of protein complexes, as well as the activity of enzymes. Here, there are some outstanding examples of these:. TULIPs (tuneable, light-controlled interacting protein tags) are two protein interaction systems based on the AsLOV2 synthetic domain caging a peptide epitope and, separately, its binding partnera variant of the Erbin PDZ domain (ePDZ) (Strickland et al., 2012). PDZ domains mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to the C-terminus of their target protein, in a sequence-specific manner. The name PDZ is an acronym of the first three proteins in which these domains were discovered: PSD-95, DLG, and ZO-1 (Kennedy, 1995).. An engineered ePDZ domain, characterized for high-affinity and high-specificity to a peptide epitope (SSADTWVCOOH) was selected (Skelton et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2009), while the peptide epitope was inserted into a truncated J helix C-terminal (called LOVpep) that had the lowest background activityno binding to ePDZ in dark. After light induction, and J undocking, this additional peptide was rapidly bound by ePDZ domain, bringing the two proteins together.. By fusing GFP-LOVpep with transmembrane protein Mid2, thereby cell membrane localisation, the system was tested for its ability to recruit ePDZ-mCherry from cytoplasm to cell periphery. Most of the ePDZ-mCherry fusion was diffusely present in the cytoplasm in dark. After light excitation (473 nm), ePDZ-mCherry quickly colocalised with GFP-LOVpep at the cell membrane of yeast (Strickland et al., 2012). LOVpep/ePDZ dimerization has been also shown to operate in HeLa cells by either cell membrane or mitochondria colocalisation. Translocation is reversible even after 3 cycles of light excitation/recovery.. In yeast, mating behavior begins upon pheromone stimulation of a GPCR, which triggers two intracellular pathways: the MAPK pathway and the GTPase Cdc24 cascade. MAPK signaling leads to G1 arrest, and in consequence, growth inhibition, and is initiated by the recruitment of scaffold protein Ste5 and other components, such as Ste11, to the activated G protein. It is known that tethering Ste5 or Ste11 to the cell membrane activates the MAPK pathway (Winters et al., 2005). The Cdc24 cascade is required for polarized growth. The investigators then designed a TULIP for optical control of either MAPK or Cdc24 activation in budding yeast, without the involvement of G proteins or GPCRs by light-activation of the recruitment of ePDZ-Ste5delN (an allele deficient in G protein binding) or ePDZ-Ste11 (for MAPK activation), and Cdc24ePDZb1 fusions to the membrane (Mid2-LOVpep, as above). As expected, all constructs showed no detectable dark-state changes, while growth arrest and/or polarization occurred upon continuous light excitation (Strickland et al., 2012). These results confirmed that this system can be successfully utilized for various purposes, including intracellular signaling.. van Bergeijk and colleagues used LOVpep not only to control protein movement but control organelle transport and positioning. Peroxisomes were labeled with LOVpep, fused to the peroxisome localization signal of PEX3. While ePDZ was fused with Kinesin-3, a plus-motor protein which moves along microtubules. Using monkey COS-7 cells as a model, the authors showed that blue irradiation triggered the translocation of peroxisomes from the cells' center to periphery, where most plus-microtubules are found. Furthermore, as the cherry (not the fluorescent protein but the fruit of Cerasus spp) on the cake, mitochondria-tagged by LOVpep, via mitochondrial membrane protein TOM20, were either translocated or anchored via microtubules along the axons of neurons, using ePDZ fused to Kinesin or SNPH, respectively (van Bergeijk et al., 2015; Figure 5B).. In another remarkable study, Wu et al. demonstrated that it is feasible to direct cell motility using LOV. They fused the LOV domain to the constitutively-active GTPase Rac1 (*Rac1), a regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, and thus cell migration. In dark, the LOV domain sterically blocks *Rac1, uncaging Ja helix by light leads disinhibition of *Rac1, to bind its effector protein and polymerise actin filaments. This reversible mechanism was sufficient to create cell movement in the direction of light (Wu et al., 2009; Figure 5C).. Some of the systems described above could be considered molecular machines, as the definition for these is an assembly of a distinct number of molecular components that are designed to perform machinelike movements (output) as a result of an appropriate external stimulation (input) (Balzani et al., 2000). Most molecular machines combine synthetic with natural molecules to achieve certain activity e.g., movement. Until now, virtually all molecular machines have been tested using purified molecules under carefully controlled environments. An example of this: kinesin molecules used as nanocarriers as they move along purified microtubules attached to a surface (Bachand et al., 2005; Furuta et al., 2017). Molecular machines have the potential to harness the cells' metabolism as fuel, while driving pre-determined cellular activities. We refer the reader to specialized reviews on this subject (Balzani et al., 2000; Collin et al., 2001; Wesley and Browne, 2006; Feringa, 2007; Cheng and Stoddart, 2016).. . . Photo-finish: light-induced dissociation. In all LOV stories (above), the storyline has been along the final union of two protein complexes and their cargoes. Yet, LOV has a dark side too, something that has recently given rise to LOVTRAP. LOVTRAP builds on the LOV2 domain anchored to the mitochondrial membrane, and the Zdk domaina genetically engineered Z domain of bacterial protein A which has high affinity to the dark state of LOV2. Therefore, attaching Zdk to a POI results in colocalisation with mito-LOV2 (LOVTRAP). Cyan-light induces LOVTRAP to release Zdk-POI, a 150-fold change in the dissociation constant, to the cytosol, in a reversible manner. LOVTRAP has been successfully used to fine-tune the sequestration and release of several cytoplasmic proteins (GTP exchange factor Vav2, GTPase Rac1, and PI3K kinase) in mammalian cells, actions that modulated the activity of these proteins without any influence from endogenous regulatory pathways (Wang et al., 2016).. Another photo-dissociating protein is Dronpa, a green florescence that changes conformation from tetrameric to monomeric, and back, depending on the wavelength of light excitation. Dronpa owes its name to dron, a ninja term for vanishing, and pa referring to photoactivation. The dronpa gene was discovered during a screening of cDNAs from stony coral Pectiniidae sp. (Ando et al., 2004). Dronpa protein may occur in two stages: ON as a bright green tetramer, or OFF as a dark monomer under cyan light (~500 nm) excitation. Furthermore, violet light (~400 nm) is able to restore tetrameric formation (Ando et al., 2004; Zhang and Cui, 2015). Note: a rationally designed dimeric Dronpa has been developed by site-directed mutagenesis (Zhou et al., 2012). These ON/OFF properties of Dronpa have been successfully used in vivo in zebrafish to visualize single neurons inside tissues. For this purpose, temporal neuronal-specific expression of Dronpa was achieved by mRNA transfer. Then, time-lapse imaging was performed by erasing the Dronpa fluorescence entirely, and re-highlighting it in a single neuron by violet-light. This procedure was repeated several times in order to reconstruct the entire neural network of zebrafish (Aramaki and Hatta, 2006). Besides Dronpa's light-switchable states, it has also been used to disaggregate proteins, mostly from a caged conformationtwo Dronpa molecules flanking a functional domain. Dimeric or tetrameric Dronpa, upon cyan-light, dissociate, exposing the caged domain. For example, ITSN2 (Intersectin 2, Cdc42-specific mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF) was fused to a Dronpa at each end. One of the Dronpa moieties had a membrane localization signal (CaaX). ITSN2, which normally activates Rho family GTPasesthe master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and is associated with centrosomes (Yeh et al., 2007; Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2010), was inactivated by two flanking Dronpa caging. Upon cyan-light, Dronpa dissociated exposing the ITSN2 functional domain, prompting the formation of abundant filopodia within 30 min from illumination (Zhou et al., 2012; Figure 6). The same approach was used to generate a Dronpa-caged hepatitis C virus NS3-4A protease. Upon blue-light activation, protease activity was measured by the release of a mCherry-ss-CaaX from the cell membrane by cleaving its substrate site (ss) (Zhou et al., 2012).. . Figure 6. . Photo-de-dimerization. Dronpa protein can occur in two reversible stages: ON as a bright green tetramer (or a engineered dimer), or OFF as a non-fluorescent monomer under cyan light (405450 nm), and back to ON stage after UV light excitation (390 nm). Light-induced dissociation used to control the activity of ITSN, a Rho GTPases regulator. The caged conformationa Dronpa-ITSN-Dronpa targeted to the membrane via CaaX motif forming a tetramer. Cyan-light induces tetrameric dissociation unblocking ITSN active site and the formation of fillopodia. The process can be reversed by UV light.. . . . . . Parting for a new partner. UV-resistance locus 8 (UVR8) is an Arabidopsis photoreceptor protein. This protein forms homodimers that are photolabile and thus dissociate upon ultra-violet light (UVB) exposition (Chen D. et al., 2013). Photon absorption leads to conformational changes, which remain for several hours (Christie et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012). After dissociation, monomers reversibly bind to partner COP1 (constitutively morphogenic 1) protein (Kim and Lin, 2013).. UVR8 has been mainly used to regulate transcriptional activation, where a DNA-binding domain fused to COP1 e.g., GAL4 DNA-binding domain-COP1, binds to a specific promoter, yet transcriptional activation is achieved by binding of photoconverted UVR8 fused to a transcriptional activator, such as NF-B transcription domainwhich causes a linear induction of a gene expression in mammalian cells (Crefcoeur et al., 2013).. The first light-triggered protein secretion method was developed using UVR8 protein properties. UVR8 was fused with C-terminal domain of well-documented secretory trafficking marker VSVG (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein) and tagged with a fluorescent protein (FP). UVR8-VSVG-FP formed homodimers that were sequestered at the endoplasmic reticulum until photoactivation caused robust forward trafficking to the cellular membrane through the secretory pathway in neurons (Chen D. et al., 2013). This allowed the visualization of cellular markers and secreted cargo as it traverses the secretory pathway. Moreover, it circumvents the requirements of other tuneable secretion systems such as temperature changes or chemical-induction. An advantageous additional feature is that tryptophan-rich UVR8 domain requires no cofactor for photoreaction (Zhang and Cui, 2015), although exposure to UV light is a cause of concern, due to cellular and genetic damaging effects.. . . Finding a partner when illuminated. The HY4 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana, encoding a protein with characteristics of a blue-light photoreceptor, was first described by Margaret Ahmad and Anthony R. Cashmore in 1993 (Ahmad and Cashmore, 1993). CRY2 (blue-light receptor cryptochrome 2), product of HY4, is a member of photolyase-like blue-light receptors which mediates light responses in plants (Liu et al., 2008). CRY2 is the best characterized photosensor in Arabidopsis, where upon light activation physically interacts with, and activates, the transcription factor Cryptochrome-Interacting Basic helixloophelix 1 (CIB1) (Liu et al., 2011), an interaction that is reversed in absence of blue-light (Liu et al., 2013).. The CRY2/CIB1 interaction was initially tested in mammalian cells by re-localizing proteins to the plasma membrane: CIB1 was fused with GFP and the CaaX prenylation motif for plasma membrane localization, whilst CRY2 was fused to mCherry. Blue-light resulted in the recruitment of CRY2-mCherry from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane of transfected HEK293 cells within seconds (Figure 7A). In the same work, the authors described the creation of a split CRE recombinase (see Box 3) that can form a functional enzyme when the two complementary halves are united by CRY2/CIB1 under blue-light in HEK293 cells (Kennedy et al., 2010).. . Figure 7. . Non-membranous opto-dimerisers. (A) Dimerization by light. There are several available light-activated dimerisers such as CRY2 and CIB1 (others are portrayed too, see Figure 8). Heterodimerisation allows the coupling of complementary fragments or separated proteins upon photo-illumination. (B) Vesicle control by CRY2/CIB1. Different Rab GTPases, a family of proteins that bind to different membranes, were fused to CIB1 and co-expressed in cells with CRY2-YFP. In darkness, vesicle transport behaved normally, and CRY2 was found freely diffusing in the cell. Blue-light activation resulted in the aggregation of CRY2/CIB1-Rab GTPase as photoactivated-(pa)CRY2 not only binds to CIB1 but is also attracted to other paCRY2. (C) Control of vesicle-dependent processes. Rab GTPases mediate processes such as receptor transport, protein sorting, endocytosis, and protein secretion, thus using CIB1-Rab GTPase/CRY2-YFP it is possible to control such processes dependant on the chosen Rab GTPase.. . . . In a different work, researchers showed that the CRY2/CIB1 could be used to photo-manipulate transport vesicles inside cells by fusing CIB1 to Rab GTPase, a protein that binds to vesicle membranes, and co-expressed with CRY2-YFP in cells. In darkness, vesicle transport behaved normally, and CRY2-YFP was found freely diffusing in the cytoplasm. Blue-light activation resulted in the aggregation of CRY2-CIB1-Rab GTPase, as photoexcited-CRY2 not only binds to CIB1 but also becomes attracted to each other (Figure 7B). Such clumps disrupt vesicular transport, suspending it until blue-light is turned off. In this way, the functions of specific Rab proteins in vesicular transport could be studied in neurons (Nguyen et al., 2016; Figure 7C). Rab GTPases mediate processes such as receptor transport, protein sorting, endocytosis, and protein secretion, thus using this method it is possible to control such processes, depending on the chosen Rab GTPase.. Since 2016, a second-generation CRY2/CIB1, having smaller proteins with reduced association in darkness and improved signaling states upon blue-light stimulation, is available (Taslimi et al., 2016). Yet, the conformation between CRY2 and CIB1 may prevent the interaction of cargo proteins. For example, Nihongaki and co-workers attempted to create a photoactivatable CRISPR/Cas9 using these partners carrying complementary halves of Cas9. However, that yielded no functional Cas9 and thus the authors chose a different pair of dimerising proteins, called magnets (see below).. Phytochromes B (PhyB) are chromoproteins naturally occurring in cyanobacteria and plants. PhyB binds to chromophore phycocyanobilin (PCB) as a cofactor that functions as a red-light sensor. Upon red-light exposure (~660 nm), PCB induces a conformational change in PhyB leading to its active form, PhyBFR. This form interacts with Phytochrome Interacting Factor (PIF), an interaction that can be reversed with even further far-red light (~740 nm; Ni et al., 1999; Kim and Lin, 2013). The Phy/PIF system has been used in mammalian cells to control the actin cytoskeleton where PIF was fused to a constitutively active *Rac1 and this moiety was recruited to specific edges of the cell by photoactivating a PhyB tethered to the cell membrane. The result was the formation of protrusions (filopodia) from cell edges exposed to red-light (Levskaya, 2009), similar to the morphological changes to the LOV-Rac1 example described above.. Recently, the PhyB/PIF pair has been optimized for zebrafish by delivering a novel engineered PCB into embryos along with an optimized PhyB/PIF pair. Upon red-light exposure, membrane localized, PhyB-CaaX rapidly recruited PIF. Additionally, shifting the light to 750 nm released PIF back to the cytoplasm. To test whether the polarity of protein distribution could be manipulated at specific subcellular regions in living embryos, the authors generated a Pard3 (apical polarity protein 3)-PIF6 fusion protein, which could be directed by light to its binding partner, Pard6-PhyB-CaaX, at illuminated cell-to-cell joins, causing changes of polarity during neural tube development (Buckley et al., 2016).. One advantage of PhyB/PIF is its excitation wavelength, which is ideal for in vivo applications. Unfortunately, PhyB's chromophore, PCB, is absent in animal cells and thus should be exogenously supplemented which is a minor deterrent in vitro but a serious limitation in vivo.. The different wavelengths required for activation of optogenetic proteins makes feasible multi-chromatic inducible operations, as was achieved and reported by Mller et al. (2013) exploiting already existent optogenetic proteins. This was proved in single cells carrying three different gene reporter constructs and three different optogenetic dimerising proteins fused to transcriptional activators. These were: (1) a 311 nm UVR8/COP1 pair, where UVR8 was fused to macrolide-responsive repressor E, that binds near a minimal human cytomegalovirus promoter PhCMVmin, and COP1 fused to transcriptional activator V16 (Mller et al., 2013); (2) a Gal4-LOV-p65 (the activation domain of NF-B transcription factor) which upon 465 nm light homodimerises and binds to the CMV promoter (Wang et al., 2012); and (3) a 660 nm PIF-TetR, a protein recognizing the TetO operator, and PhyB-V16 (Chen X. et al., 2013). Each of these constructs only induced specific gene expression (PhCMVmin-angiopoietin, CMV-vascular endothelial growth factor and TetO-firefly luciferase, respectively), in response to the correct wavelength, in a single cell (Mller et al., 2013).. Despite these impressive results, optogenetic techniques have limitations: they leak at different degrees in dark, heterodimerision might occur when the unstimulated proteins are overexpressed, and, in the case of protein dissociation, the two subunits must be at virtually identical levels, or the trapping one in excess, so there is no free active-subunit. Major challenges remain for the optimization of LOV-caged protein activity with no universal solution for them (Wu et al., 2009). Another disadvantage of the blue-to-orange excitation spectra is that they do not penetrate animal tissues as well as red-light (Jacques, 2013) which reduces their applications in vivo. Figure 8 summarizes several optogenetic actuators in relation to their activation wavelengths and characteristics.. . Figure 8. . A guide to some of the most commonly used optogenetic systems to-date. Scheme of properties and conformational changes of several photoactivatable systems [phytochrome B (PhyB-PIF), red-light activatable phosphodiesterase (LAPD), Chrimson, Halorhodopsin (NpHR), Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), LOV domain, adenylyl cyclase (bPAC), Dronpa and UV-resistance locus 8 (UVR8-COP1)]. Individual light-induced proteins have been assigned to their activation wavelength. Each system is shown before light stimulation (left) and after irradiation (right). Necessary cofactors are marked. Simultaneously this diagram shows the characteristics of different wavelengths on cell structures as well as tissue penetration. The detailed description of all these proteins can be found in the text this article. The image is partially based on (Zhang and Cui, 2015) and examples within the text.. . . . The majority of somatic cells experience mechanical forces, namely pressure, flow, stretching, etc, during their existence. Cells respond to such mechanical forces in multiple ways but ultimately change their phenotypes and cellular activities. Therefore, mimicking physiological conditions is essential to understand cellular activities.. . . . Let the force be with you: regulation of mechanotransduction. A variety of methods, exist to analyse cellular responses to mechanotransduction. Noting that physical stimulation of cells is characterized by a low efficiency (Liu et al., 2016). Experimental strategies to induce mechanical stress include: fluid shear stress, where cells are exposed to changes in the perfusion and/or viscosity of fluids, and cell stretchingwhere the adhesion surface is stretched. Although, the advantage of these techniques is a very precise regulation of cell morphology, and the possibility of coupling these systems to high-resolution microscopy, the manipulation of specific mechanoreceptors at the molecular level is not possible.. To address this issue, functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (fMNPs) have been engineered to bind specific cellular mechanoreceptors, after which, using magnets, the fMNPs can be pulled into any given direction to trigger mechanoreceptor signaling (Etoc et al., 2013). In this manner, concrete mechanoreceptors can be specifically activated for downstream applications. It has been reported that fMNPs coated with Rho-GTPases, regulators of actin cytoskeleton, can be magnetically localized to one of the cell's edge, leading to local remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and morphological changes in various cell lines (Etoc et al., 2013). Although this procedure is highly specific, it lacks spatial resolution in particular in vivo.. By combining nano- and photo-sensing technologies, the optomechanical actuator (OMA) was generated. OMA consists of gold nanorods coated with a thermoresponsive polymer which shrinks immediately upon near-infrared illumination, thereby applying a mechanical load to e.g., a membrane receptor attached to an immobilized ligand. Thus, allowing manipulation of receptor mechanics with high spatio-temporal resolution. This method exploits optomechanical actuation of transmembrane receptors that are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. These optomechanically activated receptors triggered the local recruitment of the focal adhesion markers: paxillin, F-actin and vinculin which allow the precise control of focal adhesion formation, cell protrusions, cell migration and T cell activation, through the application of cyclic mechanical stimulation induced first by near-infrared illumination. OMA can also be used in combination with protein ligand receptors (Liu et al., 2016).. In all cases, mechano- or magnetic-stimulation involve specialized equipment and thus not commonly used (Liu et al., 2016). Moreover, these techniques are mainly focus on the engineering of chambers and/or functionalized nanomaterials, which are then used to study simple cultures or single cells. We refer to reader to a couple of specialized reviews on the subject (Humphrey et al., 2014; Iskratsch et al., 2014). fMNPs could be used in vivo under controlled conditions though.. A very elegant approach has been the adaptation of the Notch signaling concept. The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cell communication mechanism present in most multicellular organisms. This pathway plays essential roles during cell fate determination in both during development and tissue homeostasis. The Notch pathway functions via mechanoactivation by any of Notch ligands (DLLs or JAGs) on the signaling (aka sender or sending) cell, which binds and activates the Notch receptor on the neighboring cellthe receiving (aka receiver) cell. This interaction results in conformational changes in Notch extracellular domain and the exposure of a cryptic region that is then proteolyticaly cleaved by disintegrin, ADAM metalloproteinase and finally, intracellularly, by gamma-secretase. The result is the release of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) which then translocates to the nucleus to function, together with a complex of other proteins, as a transcriptional activator (TA) (Kopan, 2002).. Instead of being limited to Notch receptors and Notch ligands, Morsut and collaborators engineered a series of constructs, called synthetic Notch (synNotch), where the extracellular domain of Notch was replaced by monoclonal antibodies, fused to the transmembrane domain (TMD) of Notch, followed by different transcription factors at the intracellular domain. As in Notch activation, the mechanical forces between the antibody and the surface-attached antigen resulted in the exposure of the cryptic region and the release of the intracellular domain (transcription factor). SynNotch was tested using a variety of transcription factors on cells that only upon presentation of the correct antigen, immobilized or presented by another cell, translocated to the nucleus and transactivated a reporter gene (Morsut et al., 2016; Figure 9). The flexibility of this system allows the generation of circuits and/or cell communication networks e.g., activation of one synNotch in a cell induced the expression of a membrane-bound specific antigen which in turn activated the neighboring cell(s) expressing the synNotch for this consecutive antigen. By this means, the authors created a multi-layered cell cascade using epithelial cells (Morsut et al., 2016).. . Figure 9. . SynNotch system. Activation of Notch by its ligand (DLL) leads to mechanical forces and further proteolytical (scissors) cleavage of Notch extracellular domain (NICD) which then translocates to the nucleus and modulates gene expression. SynNotch exploits the mechanism of Notch receptor activation, using an antibody as an extracellular domain fused to the transmembrane domain (TMD) of Notch. Instead of NICD, different transcription factors can be used. The mechanical forces between the receptor (antibody) and the cell- or surface-attached ligand (antigen) resulted in the release of the intracellular domain (transcription factor) and the transcription of specific genes (reporters).. . . . Since the extracellular domain (antibody), ligand (antigen) and intracellular domain (transcription factor) are exchangeable, multi- and orthogonal-signaling are possible. The only limitation of this technique is the need for surface-attached ligand(s), in other words, an artificial environment needs to be generated which obviously limits in vivo applications. Yet, it can be used to unravel many other important biological questions, and pave the way for more complex synthetic circuits in mammalian cells which is needed for proper tissue engineering.. . . Back to bases: genomic control. The modification of cellular behavior cannot be completed without the ability to modify the cell's genome and epigenome. As expected, the obvious design to modify the genome was by use of site-specific nucleases, although it was the advent of RNA-guided nucleases that has revolutionized the field completely.. Traditionally, gene control has been achieved by the use of vectors that carry genes under constitutive promoters. This view has gradually been replaced for tools that are able to erase, edit, or turn on or off endogenous genes. Genome editing, the availability to rewrite the information in the genome, is undergoing a craze due to a series of new and innovative methods that have made gene editing possible by virtually any lab.. The crucial breakthrough in genome editing was domestication of several naturally occurring DNA-binding proteins, and then their genetic modification, which lead to their sequence-specificity. Firstly, meganucleases, restriction endonucleases with long (1440 bp) recognition sites, were meticulously mutated to recognize and cut desired sequences (Grizot et al., 2009). Yet, this is labor-intensive and the new restriction sites do not differ significantly from the original, further they might be promiscuous to their recognition sequences.. Instead of designing nucleases that recognize and cut DNA within the same domain, DNA-binding domains from different proteins could be used for sequence specificity, and then fused to a nonspecific nuclease. On this view, polydactyl zinc-fingers (ZFs) (Maeder et al., 2009; Gonzalez et al., 2010) were created. ZFs are domains found in transcription factors, DNA- and RNA-binding proteins that recognize a triplet of nucleotides. Thus, combining different ZFs, sequence-specific domains can be created. Due to their modular properties, and since they do not have nuclease activity on their own, ZFs were fused to the nuclease domain of the FokI restriction endonuclease and named ZF nucleases (ZFNs) (Kim et al., 1996). Locus specificity of ZFNs is determined by the ZFs, while. FokI, which needs to work as a dimer to cut DNA, functions as genetic scissorstwo adjacent ZFNs, on opposite strands of DNA, are required to cause double strand brakes (DSB) (Urnov et al., 2010). Nevertheless, ZFNs have several limitations as there is no ZF modules for each of the 64 possible triplets.. In 2009, two independent groups reported the decoding of the Transcription Activator Like Effectors (TALEs) (Boch et al., 2009; Moscou and Bogdanove, 2009), natural type III effector proteins secreted by numerous species of the plat parasites Xanthomonas spp. These proteins modulate gene expression in host plants to facilitate bacterial colonization and survival. TALEs are beautiful modular proteins, each module identical to the others but in two residues (variable di-residues) (LTPEQVVAIASxxGGKQALETVQRLLPVLCQAHG) and each module binds to a single nucleotide in genomic DNA. In Xanthomonas there is an additional transcriptional activator (TA) attached to the C-termini of these proteins. Following ZFNs, TALEs have been fused to Fok1 to cut specific DNA sequencescalled TALE nucleases or TALENs (Miller et al., 2011; Mussolino et al., 2011; Mussolino and Cathomen, 2012).. TALEs have not only been used as nucleases but also, as in the original Xanthomonas scheme, fused with a transcriptional activator (TA) e.g., TBP (TATA-binding protein) (Anthony et al., 2014) or a transcriptional repressor (TR). Since TALEs bind specific regions of DNA without affecting it, they have also been coupled to optogenetic proteins for the activation or repression of gene expression, and named Light-Inducible Transcriptional Effectors (LITEs). LITEs modulate gene expression by virtue of two components: TALE-CRY2 which is designed to recognize a target locus (see below) and CIB1 linked to either a TA e.g., VP64, or a TR e.g., KRAB or p300core. TALE-CRY2 binds to DNA and upon blue light dimerises to CIB1-TA or CIB1-TR to induce activation or silencing of gene expression, respectively (Konermann et al., 2013; Figure 10E).. . Figure 10. . Gene targeting. (A) CRISPR/Cas9 is based on Cas9 endonuclease and its guide RNA (gRNA = crRNA and tracrRNA synthetic fusion). The 5 end of the gRNA contains a sequence complementary to the target. Cas9/gRNA complex binds and cleaves specific DNA sequence only if followed by a PAM motive (NGG). (B) CRISPRi system utilizes fusion of dCas9, and DNA-binding domain (DBD), to a protein known to recruit repressive chromatin-modifying complexes, such as the Kruppel associated box protein (KRAB), which induces H3K9 methylation, resulting in virtually complete gene repression. (C) CRISPRa is used for gene transcriptional activation. dCas9 was fused to a transcriptional activator (TA) such as VP64 or VP128. (D) paCRISPR (photoactivatable CRISPR) utilizes photo-dimerising proteins called Magnets (positivepMag and negativenMag). Upon light activation, the split fragments of Cas9 [Cas9N713 (residues 2-713) and C714 (residues 714-1,368)] are united to form a fully functional Cas9, i.e., a paCRISPR-TA for controlled transcriptional activation depicted. (E) LITE system enables modulating of gene expression by virtue of two components: TALE-CRY2, as a DBD, and CIB1 linked to either a TA e.g., VP64, or a transcriptional repressors (TR) e.g., KRAB. Upon blue-light TALE-CRY2, bound to DNA, dimerises to CIB1-TA or CIB1-TR inducing activation or silencing of gene expression, respectively.. . . . The advantage of TALEs and LITEs are their pliability, as many other genomic editors can be placed to study genetics and epigenetics (see below). Although, TALEs are genetically constructed by assembling almost identical modules, there are several excellent methods to facilitate their cloning, such as Golden Gate and LIC (Cermak et al., 2011; Schmid-Burgk et al., 2013). Addgene maintains an up-to-date list of techniques and TALE plasmid kits at https://www.addgene.org/talen/.. A better modular design could hardly be envisioned, but then however the type II CRISPR systems, which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, began to be understood (Mojica et al., 2009). Unlike previous designed-nucleases, type II CRISPRs combine RNA and proteina nucleaseto target specific sequences of DNA, or RNA (see below).. CRISPR are the adaptive immune system of prokaryotes (bacteria and archae) and involve RNA-activatable nucleases. The activating RNA(s), sometimes one and sometimes two, guide the nuclease to the nucleic target, in most cases DNA. The components of CRISPR have been discovered in parts and has been enigmatic until recently. The first full description of CRISPR/Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus thermophiles was achieved by two independent groups (Gasiunas et al., 2012; Jinek et al., 2012). They found that CRISPR/Cas9 required two RNAs to be able to target DNA. One of the RNAs, called CRISPR-related RNA (crRNA) encodes the target in its 5 terminal, while the rest is partially complementary to a second RNA, the transactivator of crRNA (tracrRNA). The crRNA-tracrRNA complex is recognized by Cas9 and together they find the complementary match to the 5 region of the crRNA.. The target, an invading phage's DNA, should have a complementary sequence to the crRNA 5 end, followed by a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), a short sequence that is not present in the crRNA (and thus absent in the prokaryote's genome) as a safeguarding element to avoid self-immunity.. CRISPR is, to date, considered the simplest and most efficient editors of (epi)genomes, since it involves no protein engineering (Sander and Joung, 2014; Barakate and Stephens, 2016). One of the most favorable features of these nucleoproteins complexes is that they unite all the components of the. molecular biology central dogma (DNA-RNA-protein). This is virtually exclusive to them and thus many of the applications we will mention below are possible thanks to this fact.. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 has been simplified by linking the two types of RNA into one single-chain guide RNA (gRNA, aka single guide RNA or sgRNA) (Jinek et al., 2012; Wang and Qi, 2016), and later on, adapted to gene editing in mammalian cells by Feng Zhang's and George Church's labs (Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013; Figure 10A).. Other simplifications involve (1) the co-expression of Cas9 and the gRNA from a single plasmid, the gRNA being expressed under a pol III promoter such as U3, U6 or H1, while Cas9 under the universal CMV promoter (Cong et al., 2013); (2) The expression of multiple gRNAs from a single transcript by use of either Csy4 endoribonuclease (Box 1) (Nissim et al., 2014; Tsai et al., 2014) or ribozymesself-cleaving RNA domains (Box 2), or a highly conserved tRNA-processing mechanismwhere endogenous RNases remove extraneous 5 and 3 sequences from the tRNA precursors (Carter and Wolfenden, 2015; Xie et al., 2015; Qi et al., 2016). Why multiple gRNAs? First because an increased number of targeting gRNAs enhanced mutagenesis efficiency in rice and maize (Xie et al., 2015; Qi et al., 2016), and second, because this allows multigene targeting (Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Niu et al., 2014).. . Box 1. . CSY4.. . Csy4 protein, first described in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pectobacterium atrosepticum, is an RNA endoribonuclease that processes CRISPR transcripts (pre-crRNAs) (Haurwitz et al., 2010; Przybilski et al., 2011). Csy4 recognizes a 28 bp spacer sequence (GUUCACUGCCGUAUAGGCAGcuaagaaa), where the last 8 nts can be variable (Tsai et al., 2014), on pre-crRNAs and cleaves immediately after the 20th nucleotide (Haurwitz et al., 2010, 2012; Sternberg et al., 2012). Due to the fact that Cys4 remains bound to the cleaved RNA, this enzyme can be used to cleave as well and binding RNA.. Csy4 has been used for producing gRNAs encoded in the 3'UTR mRNA of other genes expressed under the CMV promoter. One, or several gRNA is flanked by two Csy4 binding sites. Double cleavage by Csy4 releases the functional gRNA for further activation of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of genomic loci. These tools were used for efficient modulation of endogenous promoters and implementation of tuneable synthetic circuits, including multi-stage cascades and RNA-dependent networks (Bikard and Marraffini, 2013). Csy4-based multiple gRNA generation for CRISPR applications has been applied in zebrafish, where several genes were simultaneously knocked out (Qin et al., 2015).. . . Box 2. . RNA selfies.. . Ribozymes are RNA molecules that can perform enzymatic reactions, usually self-cleaving. Due to this feature, they have been used to cleave mRNA in bacteria and eukaryotes. The finding that some ribozymes can be inhibited by small molecules like theophylline toyocamycin (Thompson et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2005) allows the control of such riboswitches (Figure 12A). Interestingly, photo-caged derivatives of toyocamycin exist, and they have been used for photochemical modulation of the protein expression in mammalian cells (Young et al., 2009).. Since ribozymes cleave RNA unaided, they have been used to excise gRNAs from the 3'UTR of reporter genes or even of Cas9 to assure expression of both as well as to generate multiple gRNAs from a single transcript (see main text for details).. The use of nucleoside analogs (as toyocamycin) into cells causes significant side effects. Thus, the development of more specific strategies is necessary in order to use this approach in gene expression control.. . . Box 3. . Site-specific recombinases (SSRs).. . SSRs are sophisticated scientific tools that provide the possibility of precise manipulation of genomic DNA. Best known recombinases are: Vika, VCre, phiC31 integrase, Dre, Nigri/nox, Panto/pox, Flp, Dre and Cre (Sauer and McDermott, 2004; Karimova et al., 2016; Kawano et al., 2016). Once a recombinase recognizes two specific sites, it recombines them into one, excising the flanked DNA region. An exception of this rule is when the recognition sites are in opposite directions, in such case the area between them is inverted.. As recombinases require the specific insertion of recognition sites in the genome, and since they have been multiple times reviewed elsewhere, we will just mention that these methods have also been modified so they can be regulated: (1) by chemicals, examples are the tamoxifen-inducible CreER2 by binding a mutant estrogen receptor to prompt translocation of Cre into the nucleus, or rapamycin-CID of split Cre (Banaszynski et al., 2005). (2) by optogenetics by use of complementing Cre fragments fused to either magnets or CRY2-CIB1 (Feil et al., 1997; Jullien, 2003; Kennedy et al., 2010; Duyne, 2014; Gonzalez et al., 2015; Kawano et al., 2016).. . As pol III promoters cannot provide tissue-specificity expression of gRNAs, producing multiple gRNAs has been made possible by incorporating gRNAs into the 3UTR of Cas9 mRNAregulated by a pol II promoter, and flanking them with ribozymes (Yoshioka et al., 2015; Xu L. et al., 2016), or Csy4 recognition sites (Box 1; Tsai et al., 2014).. CRISPR/Cas9 has already demonstrated its effectiveness to modify endogenous genes of various bacterial, plant or animal organisms, and currently there is the first human clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02793856?term=crispr&rank=4). In addition, it should be noted that gRNA libraries have been successfully implemented in studies of the function of coding (Chen et al., 2015) and non-coding RNAs (Copeland et al., 2001; Kim and Kim, 2014; Ma et al., 2014).. Targeting of specific loci allows the disruption of genes by indels (short insertions or deletions) during double-strand break (DSB) repair, as well as the creation of seamless knock-ins, point mutations, and more. Nonetheless, gene correction and knock-ins are still too inefficient for most clinical applications.. . A CRISPR regulator. Nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) is catalytically inactivedue to two point mutations in its nuclease domainseach cutting a single DNA strand. Yet, it retains its gRNA binding and DNA target capabilities. Therefore, it becomes an RNA-guided DNA-binding protein (Gilbert et al., 2013; Larson et al., 2013). Similarly to the abovementioned TALEs fused to transcriptional effectors, dCas9 has been adapted for transcription modulation of endogenous genes by either turning them OFF (CRISPRi, CRISPR interference) or ON (CRISPRa, CRISPR activator) and even fused to Fok1 to generate duoble-dCas9-Fok1 that were expected to have less off-target effects (Guilinger et al., 2014; Tsai et al., 2014).. Turning genes off has been achieved solely by targeting dCas9 to the promoter of a gene, although this often results in only partial disruption of gene transcription (Mali Prashant, 2014). CRISPRi goes one step further by fusing dCas9 to a protein known to recruit transcriptional repressors (TRs) such as chromatin-modifying chromo shadow domain of HP1, the Kruppel associated box protein (KRAB), or the WRPW domain of Hes1, resulting in virtually complete gene repression (Qi et al., 2013; Keung and Khalil, 2016; Figure 10B). Additionally, for better results, the scaffold of gRNAs have been modified by inclusion of RNA stem-loops that are specifically bound by RNA-loop-binding proteins (see Table 1), such as MS2, fused with TRs (Zalatan et al., 2015; see Table 1 and Figure 12B). CRISPRi can silence both coding and noncoding genes, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNA (miRNA) (Gilbert et al., 2013, 2014; Larson et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2014). Moreover, CRISPRi can be applied to organisms that lack the RNAi machinery such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Drinnenberg et al., 2011).. . Table 1. . RNA loops and binding proteins.. . . . . .

RNA 3D structure is highly complex, which is associated with a number of its functions. RNA loops are structures which result from base pairing and can perform multiple functions such as binding to proteins, RNA or DNA. RNA-loops have been used to tag mRNA (Figure 12B) as well as to bring transcriptional regulators to the modified gRNA-loops of CRISPR/Cas9 (see text for more details). Here, we list the stem-loop structures known to bind to specific proteins.. . . At the other end, CRISPRa is used for gene transcription activation (Gilbert et al., 2014), where dCas9 has been fused to a TA such as VP64 or VP128 (Larson et al., 2013; Figure 10C). A potentiated CRISPRa exists, where dCas9 was modified with a tandem peptide tail that is then recognized by an intracellular antibody fused with a TA (VP64) (called SunTag) (Farzadfard et al., 2013; Tanenbaum et al., 2014). The multimerisation of TAs has also been achieved by use of dRNAs (dead gRNAs). dRNAs contain 14- to 15-bp target sequences and MS2-binding loops and can activate gene expression without inducing DSBs even when using an active Cas9. Originally, it was used for orthogonal gene knockout and transcriptional activation in human cells (Dahlman et al., 2015).. Since the CRISPR/Cas9 and dCas9 systems are always active, modifications to make them inducible are desirable. Once again, the techniques discussed above came to aid.. The first inducible CRISPR was a split-Cas9 composed by the C-terminal fragment and N-terminal fragment of Cas9Cas9(C) and Cas9(N)fused to FKBP or FRB, respectively. In the presence of rapamycin, Cas9(N)-FRB dimerises to Cas9(C)-FKBP formed a functional Cas9 (Banaszynski et al., 2005; Zetsche et al., 2015b). Since spatial separation of the fragments can decrease background activity, caused by spontaneous auto-assembly of Cas9, Cas9(N)-FRB was directed to the nucleus via two nuclear localization signals whilst Cas9(C)-FKBP carried a nuclear export signal.. Using the tet-inducible expression system, named Tet-on/Tet-off, a doxycycline-inducible Cas9 was generated (Gonzlez et al., 2014; Dow et al., 2015). Upon addition of doxycycline, Cas9 was expressed to introduce monoallelic and biallelic indels, as well as frame shift mutations, in multiple target loci (Dow et al., 2015). However, this method is slow as it requires transcription and translation of Cas9.. As in other chemical-induced methods, the use of small molecules produces adverse effects such as those of rapamycin/doxycycline mentioned above. Another disadvantage arises from slow diffusion, causing difficulties in their rapid removal (Nihongaki et al., 2015). Finally, in addition to the side effects, the use of chemicals result in universal targeting and dose-responses that cannot be properly controlled in vivo.. Since no other method outclasses the spatiotemporal precision of optical stimulation, a photoactivatable Cas9 (paCas9) was designed based upon the split design (above) but instead using the CRY2/CIB1 optogenetic pair. Which was unsuccessful at first, but the group of investigators lead by Nihongaki replaced CRY2/CIB1 with other photodimerising proteins called Magnets (positivepMag and negativenMag)previously reported by Kawano et al. (2015). Upon light activation, the split fragments of Cas9, (Cas9N) (residues 2-713) and Cas9C (residues 714-1,368), were united to form a fully functional Cas9. Both possible conformationsCas9N-pMag/Cas9C-nMag and Cas9N-nMag/Cas9C-pMag showed light-triggered Cas9 activity. All other features of full-length Cas9 remained unaffected, such as the PAM specificity and its nuclease activity on genomic DNA. The paCRISPR was also adapted for transcriptional activation (paCRISPRa) (Nihongaki et al., 2015; Figure 10D).. Due to the rapid Magnets' dissociation properties (Nihongaki et al., 2015), paCRISPR is likely not fully amenable to in vivo applications, which would require long photostimulation periods and thereby the immobilization of the organism. In this vein, a system where light would induce a long-lasting effect would be far more desirable.. . . More to CRISPR. The resounding success of CRISPR/Cas9 has triggered a search for other CRISPR techniques that could work better or distinctively. This has led to the discovery of a shorter Cas9 that potentially can fit in viral genomes other than lentiviruses for gene delivery and therapy (Friedland et al., 2015). Another discovery was Cpf1 which is a type V CRISPR effector endonuclease.. The most notable features of CRISPR/Cpf1 are: the absence of tracrRNA, its crRNA (4244 nucleotides) shorter than Cas9 gRNA (more than 100 nucleotides), reducing costs (Fagerlund et al., 2015), and there are significant differences in the PAM sequences of Cpf1 and Cas9 i.e., 5-T-rich vs. 3-G-rich, respectively. Furthermore, Cpf1 uses an entirely different mechanism of target recognition, and cleaves producing DNA over-hangs (Zetsche et al., 2015a; Gao et al., 2016), unlike Cas9 which makes blunt cuts. Thus, Cpf1 has been suggested as an alternative to the classic CRISPR/Cas9. It is early days and there still is some controversy on the efficacy of Cpf1, having groups reporting great effectiveness (Kleinstiver et al., 2016) whereas others do not (Kim et al., 2016; Tth et al., 2016). Undoubtedly, the specificity of Cpf1 is one of its greatest opportunities as an additional gene editor, in particular for AT-rich regions, as well as for gene editing of protozoa or organisms that have genomes with high AT content.. These CRISPR tools may be used in combination e.g., in studies on gene regulation, when there is need to target different sequences, which can be achieved using different gRNAs and crRNAs (Fagerlund et al., 2015).. Editing genes is a sound approach to study their functions, yet cell control requires that gene expression is modulated, which can only be accomplished via epigenetic editing.. . . . Nature or nurture?. Genomic accessibility is controlled by a series of epigenetic modifications that include DNA methylation, and histone methylation or acetylation. DNA is methylated by methyl-transferases (DNMT) and demethylated by TET hydroxylases, while histones are acetylated by histone acetyl-transferases (HATs), deacetylated by histone deacetylases (HDACs), methylated by histone methyl-transferases (HMTs) and demethylated by histone demethylases (HDMs) (Arrowsmith et al., 2012; Kooistra and Helin, 2012; Jin et al., 2015).. DNA methylation of CpG islands is often found in the promoters of non-expressing genes, and thus hypothesized as a repressing mark. To determine if this assumption was correct, two independent research groups used TALEs or dCas9 to deliver the catalytic domain of Ten 11 Translocation hydroxylase (TET1) to methylated CpG regions of promoters in mammalian cells. Demethylation of CpG islands lead to upregulated gene expression of endogenous genes, proving that DNA methylation indeed functions, in most cases, as a repression mark (Maeder et al., 2013; Xu X. et al., 2016; Figure 11A).. . Figure 11. . Epigenetic modulation. (A) CRISPR/TALE-targeted chromatic modification, dCas9 or TALEs as DNA binding domains may deliver several modifiers (epigenetic editors) which can modify DNA or chromatin structure and thus regulate expression of endogenous genes. Using these methods several epigenetic modifications have been achieved such as DNA methylation or demethylation, histone acetylation or methylation depending of the epigenetic editor used. (B) CRISPR-Display (CRISPR-Disp) uses the properties of long non-coding RNA molecules, which can act as scaffold for effectors (see Figure 12A). The functional RNA domains fused to gRNAs at multiple points, what allowed the display of RNA-protein complexes to genomic loci.. . . . Histone-3 lysine 9 (H3K9) di- or tri-methylation has been correlated to the compaction of chromatin and gene repression. During cell differentiation, for example during EMT, epithelial cells gain of mesenchymal cell characteristics by repression of epithelial-specific genes such as E-cadherin. Repression of this gene has been attributed to H3K9 di-methylation by Snail1. In this vein, Cho and collaborators tested the effects of methylation of histones by using TALE-TSET (a chimera of the E-Box region of Snail binding site with the SET domain of EHMT  an HMT). The increase of histone H3K9 di-methylation repressed the expression of the target gene, E-cadherin, triggering a more migratory and invasive cell phenotype as expected (Cho et al., 2015).. Acetylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27), a mark often associated with open chromatin, has also been achieved using a fusion of dCas9 with human acetyltransferase p300 targeting the promoters of the following genes: MYOD (Myogenic Differentiation 1), IL1R (Interleukin 1 Receptor Type 1), OCT4 (Octamer-Binding Protein 4), which provoked transcriptional activation of the downstream genes (Hilton et al., 2015).. Several other epigenetic modifications have also been rewritten, such as reduced histone acetylation by dCas9-LSD1an HDM; histone methylation (H3K9 tri-methylation) by dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi) (Figure 10B); or CpG methylation by dCas9-DNMT3ADNA methyltransferase (Kearns et al., 2015; Thakore et al., 2015; Vojta et al., 2016; Figure 11A). For a recent review documenting more examples refer to (Laufer et al., 2015).. Since epigenetic marks play an essential role in cell differentiation, these techniques have enormous potential for in vivo applications. Modifications such as LITE or paCRISPR will surely be applied to control specific cells at specific times e.g., during embryo development for a more detailed understanding of epigenetic regulation and function.. We consider RNA as the last frontier when it comes to manipulation, this is largely due to the plethora and complexity of RNA types and functions, and the continuously changing conformation of these molecules. Most research has focused on degrading mRNA but new and more powerful techniques are appearing that could also revolutionize how we can manipulate RNA.. . . Controlling RNA. Using small oligonucleotides, such as endogenous (miRNA) (Fabian et al., 2010), synthetic RNA (shRNA, siRNA), or other nucleic acid analogs (locked nucleic acids LNA, morpholino, 2-O-methyl RNA oligo) (Cooper et al., 2009), it is possible to block gene expression. Despite their popularity in cell biology, they can hardly be regulated, and their effects often account for partial mRNA-targeting destructionsomething that gene editing tools can outperform at the genomic level resulting in no gene at all (Evers et al., 2016). Additionally, new gene editing tools that target RNAs have been found.. Whilst the most of known prokaryotic adaptive immune systems target DNA substrates (Brouns et al., 2008; Wright et al., 2016), type III and VI CRISPR systems, e.g. C2c2, directly interfere with single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) targets carrying complementary protospacers (Shmakov et al., 2015; Abudayyeh et al., 2016). Thus, C2c2 can be programmed to cleave specific RNAs.. RNA cleavage by C2c2 is mediated by catalytic residues found in the two conserved HEPN domains (Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Nucleotide-binding). Double and quadruple HEPN mutations (R472A, H477A, R1048A, and H1053A) (dead-C2c2, dC2c2) did not affect C2c2 pre-crRNA cleaving activity, whilst all these mutants could still bind to target RNA (Abudayyeh et al., 2016). The ability of C2c2 to produce its own gRNAs allows co-expression of C2c2 and multiple-gRNAs from RNA polymerase II promoters for tissue-specific expression in vivo (East-Seletsky et al., 2016). Up to now, there is no report to the best our knowledge of any adaptation of C2c2 to eukaryotic cells.. . . Decoding the non-coding. Among the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), a group that includes siRNAs, miRNAs, circularRNAs, and piRNAs, there is a heterogeneous group called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins. LncRNAs are, in fact, the largest ncRNA transcript class in mammalian cells, with approximately 10,000 lncRNA genes so far annotated in humans. LncRNAs are emerging as crucial regulatory factors in cells, as they interact with DNA, proteins and other RNAs (Espinosa et al., 2016). Although the roles of most lncRNAs are far from being elucidated, the number of described lncRNAs is increasing and many reports suggest they participate in positively or negatively regulation of gene expression during development and differentiation as well as in disease conditions (Kornienko et al., 2013; Zhao and Lin, 2015). Some lncRNAs function as scaffolds that assemble protein complexes to activate or inactivate certain cellular functions (Lee et al., 2016; Figure 12A). Others function as guides for protein complexes to genomic loci, while a few others are known to serve as decoys that remove proteins from target genes (Yang et al., 2015). A note to the reader: there are potentially many annotated lncRNAs that do code for proteins or peptides (Espinosa et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2016), although the occurrence and relevance is currently unknown.. . Figure 12. . RNA localization and function. (A) Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles on the regulation of chromatin structure. Some lncRNAs may act as scaffolds for several effector proteins which can modify chromatin organization via recruiting chromatin modifiers; (B) Tagging RNA for tracking and visualization in living cells is possible by using RNA loops and fusion protein fusion which contain RNA loop-binding proteins fused to fluorescent proteins (FPs) such as GFP.. . . . To investigate these capabilities, researchers fused functional lncRNA domains (up to 4.8 kb) at different positions (5, middle or 3) of gRNAs so they could guide dCas9 to genomic loci of interest. Testing different architectures of CRISPR/dCas9 complexes to display fragments of lncRNAs (CRISPR-Disp) such as protein-binding cassettes, aptamers or pools of random sequences, it was shown that the scaffolding abilities of lncRNAs could be manipulated and targeted to genomic regions of interest for the control of e.g., gene expression (Figure 11B). According to the authors, CRISPR-Disp could be potentially used to ectopically target functional RNAs and ribonucleoprotein complexes to genomic loci (Shechner et al., 2015). Currently, little else has been undertaken to deal with lncRNA to control cellular phenotypes. However, the combination of lncRNAs to inducible systems (based on optogenetics or small compounds) would be required for a better understanding of the roles of lncRNAs in biology and their further applications. LncRNAs are difficult to study, due to their multiple domains which are able to bind to other RNAs, proteins, DNA and even small compounds, yet for the very same reason, being able to control them is essential to further understand cellular functions.. The use of RNAs as scaffolds or guides for proteins and/or RNAs, would require a more detailed understanding of the changing structure of RNAs. Yet, examples of RNA domains that are recognized by proteins are known, such as the RNA stem-loops (structures occur in single-stranded RNA molecules resulting from unpaired nucleotides in the middle of complementary sequences) that are recognized by a series of proteins (Table 1). These loops/recognizing proteins have been used to tag RNA for localization and tracking (Figure 12B), as well as to target mRNA localizations to specific cell compartments e.g., b-actin mRNA with multiple MS2 stemloops in its 3 UTR was dragged to focal adhesion sites by a fusion of MCP (MS2 loop binding partner) to the focal adhesion plaques protein vinculin, resulting in high local translation of b-actin and larger adhesion plaques (Katz et al., 2012).. In fact, long synthetic RNA scaffolds have already been used for the modulation of the metabolism of bacteria. Engineered RNA blocks which contain the PP7 and MS2 binding domains (Table 1), were assembled into multidimensional scaffolds with distinct protein-docking sites. These self-assembling RNA scaffolds enabled the organization of the oxidoreductive enzymes, resulting in an increase in hydrogen output in bacteriamainly by increase of the rate of electron transfer between enzymes (Delebecque et al., 2011). A similar strategy was used in E. coli to increase the metabolic output of pentadecane production by immobilization of enzymes involved in fatty aldehyde and succinate production into a synthetic RNA scaffold. The authors suggested that intra-cellular scaffolding of multi-enzymatic reactions could enhance the direct passing of intermediary metabolites from one enzyme to another, to increase the amount of the final product of the pathway (Sachdeva et al., 2014). To the best of our knowledge, synthetic RNA scaffolds have not been shown to function in mammalian cells.. . . Concluding remarks. The discovery of a multitude of different proteins, RNAs, and systems, from all over the kingdoms of life, have brought a wealth of new domains that can be adapted for the generation of novel tools in molecular and cell biology.. There is need for improvements in these techniques to the full implementation in multicellular organisms. Protein dimerization (CID) and destabilization (DD) have been used to some degree in animals showing their potential but with many shortcomings too. Several of CID/DD obstructions have been overcome by optogenetic systems, some of which, e.g., ChR2/NpHR, have already been used to control specific behaviors in rodents with astonishing results (Root et al., 2014). This is due to the very natural functioning of neurons and the light activating responses of these receptors. Optogenetics, a field just in its infancy, is already running wild and making strides in our understanding of living organisms with an incredible precision. This field will surely provide many more surprises and beautiful tools to study living organisms at the molecular level in a detail that has never been previously achieved. Comprehensive cell control will be required for tissue and organ bioengineering, as foreseen by the initial prototypes, such as the photocontrollable ray fish cyborg (Park et al., 2016).. We expect the discovery or creation - by a collective effort between in silico modeling, bioinformatics and molecular biologyof far-red responding proteins, for better penetration in tissues, proteins which respond to uncommon wavelengthsplenty of room in the green/yellow and the far-red regions (see Figure 8), for orthogonal molecular activation in the same cell, as well as smaller and more dynamic domains which could be easily delivered via viral particles.. The convergence of several of the above-mentioned techniques will likely be used to create synthetic circuits resembling natural networks but externally manipulated with minimal invasiveness, a field rapidly evolving in prokaryotes, but yet to make an entrance into eukaryotes. This will require modification of endogenous loci, insertion of multiple gene moieties, tightly regulated promoters, feedback mechanisms, minimal/no unwanted effects, and lack of leakage under non-stimulating conditions. Finally, activation should involve minimal disturbance or stress, with no side effects.. What occurred to us when planning this review was to provide the reader with a Swissknife of cutting-edge molecular biology techniques to trigger the readers' imagination to apply them to their own research, and, in some cases, to make improvements to this toolkit.. The aging process seems to be accompanied by progressive changes in epigenetic information (Pal and Tyler, 2016). Thus, besides cell differentiation, control over the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications may well lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging, and potentially help find targets for drug development or biomedical interventions.. The control of cellular processes should also be applied to other organisms, in particular organisms that can create structures such as diatoms. Controlling diatoms' frustules shape could generate biocompatible materials that self-assemble into macro structures for biomedical or industrial purposes.. The potential therapeutic uses of these techniques, one might envision gene repair, gene removal e.g., HIV, therapeutic viral self-deleting genome, genome restructuring or correction of chromosomal polyploidy. We might go further to suggest that studies on the origin of life could be supplemented with, literally, new light, by using some of these novel systems.. All in all, the future of cell control is optogenetically bright; there are many challenges ahead, mostly in areas such as RNA-control and the role of epigenetic mechanisms to fine-tune chromatin structure, and cellular function. Gene repair is still too inefficient at this point, therefore, modifications to improve the performance of gene editing tools in accuracy and efficiency are eagerly awaited, in particular.. The systems described in this review are a good start to envision the future directions in cell biology and bioengineering. The final goal is to be able to answer biological questions that have eluded us for centuries and to ultimately generate controllable living entities not only for biosafety and biopharmaceuticals but for biomaterials and tissue engineering.. . .

PMC5344333	Introduction. Plants and algae alike encounter a wide range of light conditions in nature. Damage induced by high levels of visible spectrum light (HL) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation can cause photoinhibition which is manifested by decreased photosynthetic capacity. Therefore, plants and algae have developed various photoprotection and acclimation mechanisms to reduce damage by HL and UV radiation as well as oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species generated during photosynthesis [13]. Photoprotective proteins are often coupled with chlorophyll a/b- binding light-harvesting complex (LHC) proteins, which collect the photon energy needed for photosynthesis. While LHCs and several classes of photoprotective proteins are nucleus-encoded and targeted to the chloroplast by a transit peptide, many other components of the photosynthetic machinery are encoded by genes in the chloroplast genome of photosynthetic eukaryotes [4]. This machinery has strong similarities in chlorophyte algae, streptophytes (e.g., land plants), and prasinophyte algae, which together form the Viridiplantae [5,6]. Most of its components have been characterized in model chlorophyte algae and plants, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively.. Several classes of proteins that are structurally related to LHCs appear to be involved in stress responses or photoprotection. For example, the early light-inducible proteins (ELIPs) family [7] is thought to have photoprotective roles [1,8,9]. They were first found to be produced in etiolated pea seedlings during the early phase of greening [10] and a transient increase in expression was also reported during plant chloroplast maturation [11]. ELIPs are encoded on the nuclear genome and have three transmembrane domains like the major LHCs. ELIPs are thought to transiently bind excess chlorophyll released under light stress as a photoprotective mechanism [8,12,13]. Another type of nucleus-encoded stress-response proteins that have homology to chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins are LHC Stress-Related (LHCSR) proteins [1416]. These are present in green algae and non-vascular plants, and, similar to ELIPs, LHCSR transcripts appear to accumulate under conditions that cause photo-oxidative stress, such as excessive light, as well as CO2 deprivation, sulfur and iron deprivation [1721]. In C. reinhardtii, LHCSR proteins are responsible for thermal dissipation of excess energy (i.e., non-photochemical quenching, NPQ) by binding and de-exciting photopigments, including chlorophyll [16], and mutants with two of the three LHCSR genes deleted do not survive shifts to HL [14]. Orthologs of this gene are present in many photosynthetic eukaryotes but appear to be absent from vascular plants and red algae [14,15,22]. In the former, PSBS seems to play a role similar to LHCSR [23].. For marine algae, light fields vary dramatically as a function of season, depth, load of suspended or dissolved organic material, and latitude. Penetration of UV radiation also depends on multiple factors, including seawater characteristics and geographic location [24]. UV-B (280320 nm) wavelengths are absorbed more rapidly than UV-A (320400 nm) but can be prevalent in the upper photic layer. For example, in the Sargasso Sea at 20 m depth, 10% of incident surface UV-B is still present, while UV-B is effectively absent by 70 cm below the surface in the more organic material rich Baltic Sea [25]. Prasinophytes are a group of marine algae that are widespread in marine systems [2628]. Class II prasinophytes (the Mamiellophyceae) harbor several genera that are picoplanktonic (2 m cell diameter) and represent the smallest photosynthetic eukaryotes. Picoplanktonic members of the Mamiellophyceae are found in environments ranging from the coast to open-ocean [2931]. Some, like Micromonas and Bathycoccus, are present from tropical to polar regions, while others (e.g., Ostreococcus) have yet to be reported in high-latitude environments. These three genera are thus far the only genome-sequenced representatives of prasinophytes [3234].. While the structure of the core photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) and of LHCI appears to be globally similar between prasinophytes, chlorophytes and plants, the Mamiellophyceae lack a classical LHCII [22,34,35]. Instead, they possess a unique LHC type, named LHCP (P for prasinophyte), which is likely associated with PSII. The phylogenetic position of LHCP proteins outside the clade containing the LHCII polypeptides of plants and chlorophytes make the Mamiellophyceae interesting models for understanding ancestral developments in the Viridiplantae [22,34]. Additionally, the genome sequences of Micromonas commoda and Micromonas pusilla show that both species have ELIP and LHCSR proteins, as well as another type of putatively photoprotective proteins, one-helix-proteins (OHPs) [13,34]. However, responses of prasinophyte photosynthetic and photoprotective genes to light-shifts and UV-stress have not been characterized and the present study on M. commoda (RCC299) is the first such analysis. M. commoda is a representative of Clade A, one of the seven known Micromonas clades, and is closely related to Clades B and C but evolutionarily distant from M. pusilla, which belongs to Clade D [6,30]. The Micromonas ABC-lineage as a whole appears to be broadly distributed in temperate and lower latitude oceans, but not high latitude environments where continuous light occurs during summer [6,30,36]. Here, light:dark synchronized M. commoda RCC299 cultures were investigated over a range of visible light levels. They were also subjected to environmentally-relevant HL or to HL+UV shifts for which cellular and transcriptional responses were investigated using flow cytometry, RNA-seq and qPCR. Our results indicate that this species copes well with HL shifts, but is sensitive to UV radiation over the duration and intensities tested here. Our study provides new insights into the phenotypic plasticity of this ecologically important microbe with respect to light.. . . Materials and methods. . Micromonas diel and light-shift experiments. An axenic clonal derivative of M. commoda (RCC299, deposited at the NCMA as CCMP2709) was grown in semi-continuous batch cultures at 21C on a 14:10 L:D cycle in K medium [37] prepared with artificial seawater (see http://www.mbari.org/phyto-genome/Resources.html). Cultures were diluted daily with fresh medium (or less frequently depending on cell density) so that concentrations never exceeded 6 x 106 ml-1 and maintained mid-exponential growth. Cultures were regularly inoculated into organic carbon rich test medium to verify axenicity. The relationship between irradiance and growth was studied in biological triplicates grown in 50 mL glass test tubes at ~6, 55, 150, 240, 350, 470, 620, 750 mol photons m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as measured using a QSL-2101 light meter (Biospherical Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA). Low light levels were obtained using neutral density filters (Lee Filters, Burbank, CA, USA). Bulk fluorescence was measured daily at the same morning time point using a 10-AU fluorometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Cells were acclimated to each light level for 10 generations and average growth rates were calculated over 3 to 5 consecutive transfers after acclimation by following changes in fluorescence. The latter reflect changes in cell abundance, if measured at the same time point each day in synchronized cultures. At the ~350 mol photons m-2 s-1 light level data from only one transfer was available (therefore the mean and s.d. were computed from the three biological replicates) and data from one biological replicate at 6 mol photons m-2 s-1 was from a single transfer. Once average growth rates were determined, diel changes in cellular characteristics were studied for cultures grown at three selected irradiances with 2 h interval sampling starting at 6 a.m. (the onset of the light period) for 20 h and 4 h interval sampling for an additional 12 h. Samples were preserved for analysis by flow cytometry (FCM) by adding glutaraldehyde (Tousimis, Rockville, MD, USA, final concentration 0.25%) for 20 min at room temperature in the dark, and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen.. For light-shift experiments, axenic RCC299 was acclimated to 100 mol photons m-2 s-1 PAR on a 14:10 hour L:D cycle and monitored daily by FCM. Cells were maintained in mid-exponential phase for 9 generations before the experiment start by diluting cultures daily with fresh medium to keep a concentration of 2 x 106 cells mL-1. The HL and HL+UV exposure experiments were initiated using the above mid-exponential culture, but performed at separate times due to the volumes required for RNA sequencing and associated incubator space limitations. Controls were performed alongside each experiment. For all light-shift experiments, on day one, 1 L glass (controls and HL treatment) or quartz (HL+UV treatment) Erlenmeyer flasks were filled with culture within 30 min before the start time, Time zero (T0), which in all cases occurred 4.5 h after lights-on (thus always at the same point in the diel cycle). At T0, quadruplicate controls were continued in the same conditions while the quadruplicated treatments were placed into HL (625  35 mol photons m-2 s-1), or the same HL level and UV radiation, with an expansion of flasks numbers to accommodate large volume sampling at each time point for shorter term light shift experiments as detailed below. UV was supplied by one UVB-313 (0.7 W m-2 at its 313 nm peak) and one UVA-340 (0.75 W m-2 at its 340 nm peak) fluorescent tube (Q-Panel Lab Products, Cleveland, USA). Treatment flasks were shaken at ~150 rpm and control flasks were shaken at each time point upon removal from a Percival Incubator. FCM samples were taken from each flask at 0 h (T0), 2.5 h (T2.5), 6 h (T6), 9.5 h (T9.5), and 19.5 h (T19.5, which includes the 10 hour dark period) for longer experiments. The shorter time course experiments (2.5 h length) were performed separately from the longer term light shift experiments and the flasks were sampled at 0 h (T0), 1 h (T1) and 2.5 h (T2.5) for RNA and FCM (as follows). Because the shorter term light shift experiments were designed to generate enough material for RNA-seq (1 L of culture) four flasks were sacrificed for RNA sampling at each time point. FCM was sampled throughout from all flasks such that for each treatment and control FCM came from 12 flasks at T0, from 8 flasks at T1, and from four flasks at T2.5.. . . Flow cytometry. Cultures were monitored live on a daily basis using an Epics XL (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) with data acquisition triggered by side scatter (SSC). For the light-shift experiments and the higher resolution diel studies, samples were also analyzed using an Influx (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) equipped with a 488 nm laser (200 mW output), a 70 m diameter nozzle and run at 25 l min-1. FALS, SSC and red autofluorescence derived from chlorophyll (692  40 nm band-pass) were recorded for >1 x 104 cells per sample. Micromonas and yellow-green 0.75 m polystyrene beads (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA; added as normalization standards) were defined based on fluorescence and SSC (Epics XL) or FALS (Influx) characteristics. Fluorescence and scatter properties of cells were normalized to beads (i.e., all numerical values are in bead relative units). T-tests were performed in SigmaStat (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) to compare growth rates. One way ANOVAs were used to test light intensity effects on normalized mean FALS cell-1 and red fluorescence cell-1 at each time point (also implemented in SigmaStat).. . . RNA sampling, extraction and sequencing. At each RNA time point four 1 L flasks were sacrificed and harvested by centrifugation at 21C to avoid cold shock; cell pellets were cryo-frozen and then stored at -80C. RNA was extracted from three of the four biological replicates harvested at each time point, resulting in a total of 24 samples (biological triplicates from: Control T0, T1, T2.5; HL T1, T2.5; HL+UV T1, T2.5 and an additional set of T0 control samples from the HL+UV experiment). Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit after homogenization using the QIAshredder kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. 50 L of extracted RNA was treated with 1 L of DNase (TURBO DNA-free Kit, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) at 37C for 30 min according to the manufacturers protocol. For further purification, a volume of 4.8 M LiCl (LiCl:sample 1:1, v/v) was added, samples were placed at -20C for 4 to 6 h, and centrifuged at 16,100 x g at 4C for 30 min and then transferred to fresh tubes to which 400 L 70% ethanol was added. After 10 min on ice, samples were spun at 18,000 x g for 5 min. The last two steps were repeated, the supernatant removed and the pellet resuspended in TE buffer. RNA integrity was determined using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and total RNA was quantified on the Nano Drop system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).. For short read sequencing, double stranded (ds) cDNA was synthesized using the Ovation RNA-seq System (NuGEN Technologies Inc., San Carlos, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions except half the recommended amount of first-strand primer mix was used. Briefly, RNA was reverse-transcribed to generate first-strand cDNA using oligo-dT and random hexamer primers. Ds-cDNA was generated using DNA polymerase, and linearly amplified with the Ribo-SPIA method [38]. For all samples, 1 g of the resulting ds-cDNA was used for library preparation with half of the cDNA having been fragmented by sonication. The complete sample (fragmented and unfragmented cDNA) was electrophoresed on 2.5% agarose gel and size selected for 100200 bp. After elution, cDNA fragments were blunt-ended and ligated to platform specific ds-bar-coded adapters (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Bar-coded sets of 12 cDNA libraries were mixed in equal amounts and sequenced on the SOLiD platform (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).. . . Transcriptome analyses. Reads were aligned to the RCC299 nuclear genome using BWA [39] and to the plastid genome using Bowtie [40]. The final mapped read numbers were on average 4.08  0.97 million reads per sample, with approximately half of these being aligned to the 73 kb chloroplast genome. For chloroplast genes, reads aligning between start and end coordinates were assigned to that gene. Prior to assignment, chloroplast gene models were improved (primarily by CDS extension) using the transcript data. Extended gene models and those that were unchanged are available at http://www.mbari.org/resources-worden-lab/ and two new protein-encoding genes identified here were deposited in GenBank under accessions KX172140 (ycf2) and KX172139 (ycf1). For nuclear genes, most reads aligned to the 3 terminus, within 8 read lengths of the end of existing annotations (see Results and Discussion). Therefore, transcript abundances were based on reads aligned to the last 403 nucleotides of terminal exons after careful annotation of 3 UTRs based on directionally cloned-Sanger ESTs. Nuclear genes for which the 3 UTR formed a convergent overlapping pair (with a gene on the opposite strand) were excluded because gene-specific assignments were not possible for the non-directional 3 biased transcript reads generated here.. Because of the disparity of expression data recovered from chloroplast and nuclear genes (see Results), read counts were normalized to housekeeping genes, specifically the 23S rRNA gene and chloroplast targeted GAPDH (XP_002503470), respectively, which showed less variation across the treatments than other potential housekeeping genes (e.g. Actin). We analyzed protein coding chloroplast genes as well as nuclear-encoded PSI- (all) and PSII-related antennae proteins, putative photoprotection-related proteins and two heat shock protein genes (HSP90.1 and HSP90.2). To avoid overestimating fold changes due to low nuclear genome read counts, we required that 100 reads map to the respective protein-encoding gene in one or more samples. Thus, a number of nuclear genes were excluded from differential expression analyses due to: i.) reads assigned, if any, were below this minimum cutoff (LHCSR1, LHCSR2, ELIP1, ELIP2, ELIP4 and ELIP6) or ii.) they overlapped with other genes in the 3 region confounding analyses of non-directional RNA-seq data (LHCP4, ELIP5, and ELIP3/ PSBS-like). Additionally, LHCP2.1 and LHCP2.2 are identical in the region where RNA-seq reads mapped and therefore data presented for LHCP2.2 also represents fold-changes for LHCP2.1 (using the present dataset). To determine significance of differential expression analyses an ANOVA was performed on expression data meeting the read cutoff criterion using the R programming language [41]. Data from HL and HL+UV treatments were compared to T0 and, separately, to controls from the corresponding time-point. For controls, time-points were also compared two ways, to T0 and to the immediately preceding time point (T0 for T1 and T1 for T2.5). The T0 samples from the two control experiments (associated with either the HL or the HL+UV shift experiments, respectively) were also compared to each other. Only one gene (psbT) exhibited a significant difference between these controls (S1 Table).. . . Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses. For qPCR, single stranded (ss) cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. Oligo-dT primers and 6 L total RNA (12.5 ng L-1) were used in total reaction volumes of 60 L. To check for contaminating genomic DNA, negative control reactions (RT- controls) were also prepared by omitting the reverse transcriptase enzyme.. TaqMan primer-probe sets were designed for three genes (Table 1) using Primer Express software 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Brea, CA, USA). The primer-probe sequences were compared to the M. commoda RCC299 genome [34] to confirm that only the genes of interest were targeted. Probes were labeled with the fluorescent reporter FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) and a non-fluorescent quencher at the 5 and 3 ends, respectively. The endogenous control was a previously published MGB labeled actin probe [42] with a fluorescent reporter FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) at the 5 end and a 3 non-fluorescent quencher (Table 1).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0172135.t001.

Cycling parameters were 1 cycle of 50C for 2 min; 1 cycle of 95C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95C for 15 s followed by 60C for 1 min. Primer amplicon size was checked by running the qPCR product on 3% agarose gel with a 50 bp Mini ladder (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The linear dynamic range for each primer-probe set was tested using cDNA prepared from control samples in a serial dilution of RNA. The concentration of RNA added to the cDNA reaction fell within the linear part of the curve, equivalent to a 1:1 conversion between RNA and cDNA. The efficiencies of primer-probe sets were determined using a dilution series of 1) qPCR product (purified with the MinElute PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and 2) cDNA. CT values were generated for treatment and control experiments and data were analyzed using the 2-CT method [43] performed using the 7500 System SDS Software v1.4 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with T0 as the calibrator. Actin (XP_002503091) was selected as the endogenous control because, using qPCR across the treatments herein, it showed less change in CT than GAPDH (by qPCR; in RNA-seq data from these experiments Actin showed more variability across treatments than GAPDH). Statistical significance was evaluated using an ANOVA implemented in SigmaStat.. . . . Results. . Growth and cellular changes in response to light and the diel cycle. M. commoda grew at 1.0 d-1 (1.4 divisions per day) between 50 to 750 mol photons m-2 s-1. Growth rates were significantly slower at 6 mol photons m-2 s-1 (, 0.28  0.01 d-1) and the maximum growth rate (max, 1.78  0.03 d-1) occurred at 240 mol photons m-2 s-1 (Fig 1). Cellular characteristics were tightly synchronized with the L:D cycle (Fig 2). Normalized mean FALS cell-1 increased throughout the light period (6 a.m. to 8 p.m.), indicating increasing cell size, and started to decrease at the light-to-dark transition, coincident with increased cell numbers (reflecting cell division) at all three light levels tested (Fig 2A and 2B). Like FALS, normalized mean red fluorescence cell-1 (representing chlorophyll-derived fluorescence) increased throughout the light period and decreased during night (Fig 2C). The overall amplitude of change was positively related to the culture growth rate for FALS (Fig 2B) and inversely related to the irradiance level for red fluorescence (Fig 2C). It must be noted that FALS values were equivalently low for cells grown at all three irradiances at dawn when the division phase ended (Fig 2B). Thus, the low irradiance, slow growing cultures had the smallest overall average cell size (compared to the two faster growing/higher light level cultures) at all time points except the point of the dark-to-light transition, suggesting that whatever the light level, cell size is the same after the division phase for exponentially growing cells.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0172135.g001. Fig 1. . Growth rate as a function of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for light-acclimated, mid-exponential phase cultures of Micromonas commoda (RCC299).. Cultures were grown in biological triplicate on a 14:10 L:D cycle. Symbols represent the mean of 3 to 5 transfers starting 10 generations after acclimation to the light level and error bars represent the standard error, except in two cases. For these two, data from multiple transfers post-acclimation were not available, therefore one (at 6 mol photons m-2 s-1) has no error represented and the other (350  13 mol photons m-2 s-1) shows the mean and standard deviation of the biological triplicates. At the maximum light level tested, 750 mol photons m-2 s-1, the  (0.96  0.04 d-1) was significantly lower than at 240 mol photons m-2 s-1 where max occurred.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0172135.g002. Fig 2. . Cellular characteristics over the diel cycle for cultures acclimated to three light levels.. (A) Cell abundance, (B) mean FALS in bead relative units (i.e., normalized to beads), and (C) mean chlorophyll-derived red fluorescence in bead relative units. The light (white) and dark (black) periods are indicated in horizontal bars at the top of the graph (14:10 h L:D cycle) and the x-axis is labeled in time of day, with 6 a.m. being lights on. M. commoda growth rates were 1.10 d-1, 1.76 d-1 and 1.12 d-1 at 55, 240 and 630 mol photons m-2 s-1, respectively. These growth rates were similar to those of biological triplicates shown in Fig 1, specifically, 1.04  0.04 d-1, 1.78  0.03 d-1, and 1.22  0.02 d-1, respectively, for similar light levels. Values and error bars for the 6, 10 and 14 h time points in (B, C) reflect the mean and standard deviation of measurements taken during the first diel period and those taken every 4 h until 2 p.m. of the following diel period. Because cell numbers increased with the passage of time, error was not computed from cell abundances in the first and (partial) second diel periods. Note that the HL sample for 6 a.m. on day two was lost due to instrument issues.. . . . . . Cellular responses to high light and UV radiation. Experimental manipulations involved two light treatments. In the first, acclimated mid-exponential growth cells were shifted from a control (100 mol photons m-2 s-1) to higher light level (HL, ~600 mol photons m-2 s-1) and in the second they were shifted from the control light level to HL+UV. The experiments were performed for two time-periods: long- (19.5 h, Fig 3) and short- (2.5 h, Fig 4) exposure. In both cases, the experiments were initiated 4.5 h into the light period by shifting cultures from the pre-experiment control conditions to the treatment condition or maintaining them at 100 mol photons m-2 s-1 (for controls).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0172135.g003.

Cells were in acclimated, mid-exponential growth at 100 mol photons m-2 s-1 on a 14:10 L:D cycle for 9 generations prior to the shift to 625  35 (SD) mol photons m-2 s-1 at the first time point of the experiment, T0, which occurred 4.5 h after lights-on.

Vertical bar coloring is as indicated in (A). (D-E) Percent change in bead normalized mean red fluorescence cell-1 in the (D) HL and (E) HL+UV treatments and their respective controls. Cells at T0 were 4.5 h into the light period, where red fluorescence and FALS is higher than at lights-on (see Fig 2), hence the negative percent changes at T19.5 (the point of lights-on/the end of the dark period) are expected. Data represent the average of biological triplicates and error bars represent the standard deviation. P-values <0.05 (*) and <0.001 (+, Fig 3A only) are indicated for significant differences from controls at the same time point (HL vs. control 1, HL+UV vs. control 2).. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0172135.g004.

Percent change in (A) mean normalized FALS cell-1 and (B) mean bead normalized red fluorescence for controls and the HL and HL+UV treatments. Data represent the percent change relative to T0, which occurred 4.5 h after lights-on, and the x-axis units are time from the experiment start (in hours). Cells were grown at 100 mol photons m-2 s-1 for 9 generations prior to manipulation. On the day of the experiment, cultures were sampled at T-4.5, transferred to flasks and placed in their respective treatments at T0. Data represent the average of four to twelve flasks as detailed in materials and methods, and error bars represent standard deviations of these flasks. (C-E) Fold-changes in gene expression for select genes by qPCR. Values >1 increased relative to the T0 control, while those <1 decreased. Note differences in y-axis scales. Samples that were significantly different (p<0.01) from the control (*) and HL+UV samples that were significantly different from HL at the same time point (^) are denoted. Data represent the average of four biological replicates and error bars represent the standard deviation.. . . . In long-exposure experiments, cultures were shifted after 4.5 h at 100 mol photons m-2 s-1 to the HL or HL+UV treatment for the remainder of the light period (9.5 h) then entered the dark night period, which lasted 10 h (the same L:D cycle as for cells leading up to the experiment; Fig 3A). At the experiment onset, the growth rate (1.19  0.14 d-1) was not different than the value interpolated for 100 mol photons m-2 s-1 from Fig 1. Cell abundance increased in the HL treatment more than the control by 19.5 h (Fig 3A), resulting in a significantly higher growth rate (1.37  0.03 d-1, p<0.05). Thus, within less than 24 h this HL-shifted culture achieved a growth rate similar to the cultures that were acclimated to 610 mol photons m-2 s-1 (1.36  0.15 d-1; Fig 1). In contrast, in the shift from control to HL+UV, cell numbers decreased relative to the control (Fig 3A), resulting in a negative growth rate.. As expected, changes in bead normalized mean FALS cell-1 (expressed as % increase or decrease from T0) were similar for the long-exposure experimental controls (Fig 3B and 3C) and cells acclimated to the corresponding light-level in the diel study (Fig 2B). FALS cell-1 increased during the remaining part of the light period (9.5 h) by between 120152% (relative to T0 FALS) in the controls of the HL and HL+UV experiments and was at a minimum at T19.5 (Fig 3B and 3C). Note that with respect to cell cycle stages, the %-changes in FALS at T19.5 relative to T0 are most similar to calculating the %-change between the 24 hr and 12 hr time points in the diel (Fig 2B). In the HL treatment, FALS also increased over time (Fig 3B) and did not differ significantly from controls. In contrast, FALS cell-1 was significantly lower by T2.5 in the HL+UV treatment than the control at the same time point and was lower than the T0 value by T6 (Fig 3C). Similarly, changes in mean red fluorescence cell-1 in the controls (Fig 3D and 3E) were of the same amplitude as in the diel study. This parameter also increased in the HL treatment, but less than in the controls (Fig 3D, p<0.05). Under HL+UV exposure, mean red fluorescence cell-1 decreased rapidly and was lower than controls by T2.5 (Fig 3E). As seen for FALS, T6 values were lower than T0 and continued to decrease throughout the HL+UV experiment, reaching -93  5% of T0 at T19.5, without apparent recovery during the dark period.. Changes in cellular characteristics were similar for the controls in the short exposure (2.5 h; Fig 4A and 4B) and longer duration (Fig 3B3E) experiments at the single comparable time point, T2.5. Normalized mean FALS cell-1 did not change significantly between the control and HL treatment (Fig 4A), whereas HL mean red fluorescence cell-1 was significantly lower than in the control by T2.5 (Fig 4B, p<0.05). In the HL+UV treatment mean FALS and red fluorescence cell-1 were significantly lower by 1 h (Fig 4B), indicating they were no longer progressing through the typical increases that occur across the day period as cells move towards division. Notably, there were no significant differences in FALS or red fluorescence cell-1 at T1 in the HL possibly reflecting the capacity of cells to buffer variations over short exposure, while in HL+UV large adjustments had already occurred.. . . Gene model improvement and RNA-seq analyses. RNA-seq was used to assess M. commoda responses to light shifts and UV exposure during the short-term experiments. Prior to comparing gene expression levels in the different treatments we observed reads mapped to unannotated regions of the chloroplast genome. Using this data we extended open reading frames (ORFs) for psbE, psbF, and psbB and for the 23S ribosomal RNA (rrl). We also identified and deposited two previously unrecognized genes, ycf2-like (ftsH, orf1577) and ycf1-like (orf603). The products of these genes are far more diverged from Ostreococcus homologs (ORF1260/YP_717220 and ORF537/YP_717209, respectively) than other proteins encoded by chloroplast genes that are shared by Ostreococcus and Micromonas. For example, the former protein aligned to just 605 of the 1260 amino acids (a.a.) comprising Ostreococcus tauri ORF1260/Ycf2/FtsH (with 30% identity) and blastp to NCBIs non-redundant database only otherwise recovered a Bathycoccus prasinos protein (30% a.a. identity). In contrast, the RNA polymerase beta subunits (RpoB) of these two genera share 68% a.a. identity, and the photosystem I P700 chlorophyll a apoproteins A1 (PsaA) are 97% identical. Overall, we identified 60 protein-encoding genes, 26 tRNAs and 6 rRNAs (two copies each of the 16S, 5S and 23S genes) in the chloroplast genome (92 total); these numbers include the 58 protein-encoding, 26 tRNA genes and 3 rRNAs reported previously [34].. Approximately half the RNA-seq reads generated mapped to the chloroplast genome (Table A in S1 File). Chloroplast gene transcripts are not poly-adenylated and are recovered well by random hexamers (as used here; Table A in S1 File). Organellar genomes are also typically present in high copy numbers and show elevated levels of expression such that chloroplast transcripts often represent a significant proportion of data generated in RNA-seq experiments involving algae or plants [44]. Additionally, in our study, the reads assigned to nuclear genes generally came from the 3' region, creating issues for analyzing overlapping gene pairs because the reads were non-directional. Due to these biases, expression levels were normalized to housekeeping genes from the respective genome, instead of using standard RNA-seq normalization procedures [45], and a number of nuclear genes of interest had to be excluded from differential expression analysis (see methods). Differential expression patterns were generally similar when treatments were compared to the T0 control (Fig A in S1 File) or when they were compared to the control at the same time point (Fig 5, S1 Table). However, the latter allow a more direct assessment of the effects of the treatment, rather than an assessment of the combined effects of diel (as cells progress through the cell cycle) and treatment changes that are represented by comparison to T0.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0172135.g005. Fig 5. . Expression changes for protein-encoding genes from the chloroplast genome and a subset of nuclear genes.. HL and HL+UV data represent fold changes relative to controls at the same time point, while each control time point is compared to the preceding control time point. Only genes that met coverage criteria and that displayed significant changes (p<0.01) 1.5-fold across the biological triplicates in at least one time point, relative to controls at the same time point (this figure), or relative to T0 (Fig A in S1 File), are shown. Note that all LHCs and LIL as well as HSP90.2 (XP_002507383) and NIRFU (XP_002507511) proteins have transit peptides targeting them to the chloroplast, as predicted using TargetP.. . . . . . Expressional responses of protein-encoding chloroplast genes. Fifty-six of 60 protein-encoding genes present in the chloroplast genome were analyzed for expression changes in the short-exposure experiments, while four (psbN, psbZ, psaM and rpl20) did not meet the minimum mapped-read number criterion and were excluded from differential analyses. Overall, forty-seven genes showed 1.5-fold change (p<0.01) relative to the control at the same time point (Fig 5) or to T0 (Fig A in S1 File) and nine did not exhibit significant changes (S1 Table).. Chloroplast gene expression between control and HL-shifted cells in the short-exposure treatments exhibited three main patterns (Fig 5, Fig A in S1 File, S1 Table). The first corresponded to genes encoding ATP synthase subunits (atpA, atpB, atpE, atpF, atpH, atpI) and cytochrome b6f complex subunits (petA, petB, petG), which showed no significant changes (p<0.01) between controls and HL, except for the ATP synthase CF0 subunit B (atpF) that showed a moderate under-expression in HL at T1. The second pattern involved half the chloroplast genes related to photosystem II (PSII). In HL, genes encoding the PSII reaction center proteins D1 and D2 (psbA and psbD, respectively) and the PSII core antennae CP43 and CP47 (psbC and psbB, respectively) showed small but statistically significant increases in expression at both time points, and two other PSII-related genes, psbH and psbT, also showed modest increases at T2.5 (Fig 5). When compared to T0, moderate expression increases were observed in the HL treatment for four other PSII-genes (psbF, psbJ, psbL) (Fig A in S1 File). Most other photosystem genes, notably PSI genes, including ycf3 which encodes the PSI assembly factor Ycf3, did not change significantly under HL relative to both the control at the same time point and to T0 (except psaA at T1 in the latter).. The third pattern, observed in both the controls and HL treatments, involved genes related to transcription and translation machinery (RNA polymerase subunits, SSU-rps (30S) and LSU-rpl (50S) proteins of the chloroplast 70S ribosome, translation initiation factor 1 (infA) and elongation factor Tu (tufA). For a large number of these genes expression levels decreased significantly from T1 to T2.5 (7 hours after the onset of light) in the control (Fig 5). In the HL treatment, expression of RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA), many ribosomal transcripts and infA decreased by 4 to 10-fold relative to both the control at the same time point (Fig 5) and at T0 (Fig A in S1 File).. The HL+UV treatment induced a massive reduction in transcripts from chloroplast genes involved in the PSII and PSI reaction centers as well as other categories. Although generally unchanged in the controls and HL, ATP synthase genes encoding the F0 and F1 subunits were up to 50-fold lower in expression under HL+UV. In contrast, neither petB nor petG changed significantly and petA (cytochrome f) levels were lower than the control (24 fold) only at T1 (Fig 5). Transcript levels for many other genes decreased dramatically by T1 and T2.5 relative to the corresponding controls (e.g., 30 to 50-fold lower; Fig 5, Fig A in S1 File). Interestingly, psbC increased slightly after 2.5 h as did the RNA polymerase beta chain (rpoC2) in HL+UV, while psbA, psbB and psbD showed no or little change although they had increased in HL (Fig 5). Other exceptions were for tufA which did not change significantly in HL+UV. Finally, although the Rubisco large subunit (rbcL) showed expression, no changes were observed in controls or any treatments.. . . Nuclear-genome gene expression by RNA-seq. We also analyzed genes involved in the photosynthetic antennae (chlorophyll a/b binding proteins) and photoprotection. Several LHCA and LHCP proteins, two OHPs, one LIL (LHL) and two ELIPs that are encoded on the nuclear genome, and targeted to the chloroplast by a transit peptide, could be analyzed. Of these, changes in LHC and LIL gene expression were minor in the controls and the HL treatment. Just three (LHCP2.4, LHCP2.5, LHCP2.6) of the 15 LHC genes evaluated increased significantly between T1 and T2.5 in the control, exhibiting fold changes between 1.5 to 4 fold (Fig 5, S1 Table). In the HL treatment, expression of most genes was not different from controls at either time point, except for a slight decrease in the one-helix-protein 2 gene (OHP2) at 1 h as well as LHCB5.1 and LHCP2.4 at 2.5 h (Fig 5). This indicates that at T2.5 in HL LHCP2.5 and LHCP2.6 had increased to the same extent as the diel-related changes observed in the control. Different from the HL shift, the HL+UV shift caused a significant decrease in the expression of most LHC genes relative to the control, with a 4 to 50-fold drop by the 2.5 h time point (Fig 5). In contrast, LHL, FAS-ELIP and CBR-ELIP, the two OHPs, as well as two genes coding heat shock proteins, HSP90.1 and HSP90.2, were all highly expressed in HL+UV relative to both the control at the same time point (Fig 5) and at T0 (Fig A in S1 File).. Lastly, a gene coding a putative ferredoxin-nitrite reductase protein in M. commoda (named here NIRFU, XP_002507511) showed increased expression under HL but decreased dramatically in HL+UV relative to the controls at the same time point and at T0 (Fig 5). This nuclear gene-encoded protein has a predicted chloroplast transit peptide at the N-terminus and showed homology to ferredoxin-nitrite reductases of plants [46], e.g. 53% identity to NIR in Solanum lycopersicum. However, M. commodas NIRFU also contains a C-terminal rubredoxin (a non-heme iron binding domain with an iron-sulfur center known to be involved in electron transfer) and a domain belonging to the Ferredoxin NADP+ reductase superfamily.. . . Gene expression by qPCR. We developed qPCR primer-probe sets for three nuclear LHC/LIL-related genes, including one of two LHCSR genes in M. commoda. The product of the LHCSR2 (XP_002506555) gene assayed here shows 63% amino acid identity with LHCSR1 (XP_002501722). By comparison, identity between the three Chlamydomonas LHCSR homologs is 82% and 100% (two are identical copies). LHCSR genes did not meet the mapped read number criterion for RNA-seq differential expression analysis and by qPCR less than 1.5-fold changes were observed for LHCSR2 in the controls and HL, except for HL 1 h (Fig 4C). The expression levels did not differ significantly between controls and HL at either time point. Under HL+UV, LHCSR2 expression increased 33-fold (T1) and 42-fold (T2.5) relative to T0 and was significantly different (p<0.01) than control and HL treatments at the same time point (Fig 4C).. The other two nuclear genes analyzed by qPCR did meet the mapped read number criterion for RNA-seq. Different housekeeping genes and normalization methods were used for qPCR [43] and RNA-seq analyses (see methods), making trends comparable, but not exact fold changes. By qPCR, LHCP1 expression in the control showed minimal (-1.7, T1; -1.6, T2.5 when converted from decimal values) fold changes from T0 and the most comparable RNA-seq analysis did not exhibit significant changes (Fig A in S1 File). In HL, -2.7 to -3.2-fold changes from T0 were observed by qPCR, and expression was lower than the controls at the same time point, but again changes were not visible in the RNA-seq analysis. The largest changes occurred under HL+UV (Fig 4D), with -3.9 (T1) and -3.7 (T2.5) fold changes from T0 by qPCR, and -3.1-fold (T1) and -7.0-fold (T2.5) by RNA-seq relative to T0 (Fig A in S1 File, S1 Table). Under HL+UV, LHCP1 expression was significantly lower than controls for both data types. For OHP2, the magnitude of response was much greater than LHCP1 (Fig 4D and 4E). Trends were the same for OHP2 by qPCR and RNA-seq in the HL, where expression decreased relative to T0. QPCR again showed larger decreases than RNA-seq and also showed a moderate negative fold-change in the control. OHP2 expression increased dramatically under HL+UV, and the qPCR (Fig 4E) and RNA-seq data were within the same range at both time points (RNA-seq category 10 to <30-fc; Fig A in S1 File). Because OHP2 expression declined under the shift to HL (and in the control), the massive induction of OHP2 in the HL+UV treatment appears to have been triggered by UV exposure.. . . . Discussion. . Responses to the diurnal cycle and experimental light manipulations. We show that M. commoda grows under a broad range of light intensities, including irradiances higher than those generally encountered in the upper 40 m of the photic zone where this alga appears to thrive [25,47,48]. Micromonas commoda-like strain CCMP489, another Clade A member [6,30,36], and several Ostreococcus strains including O. tauri, reportedly grew slower [4951] than RCC299 at equivalent light levels. Differences in growth conditions, such as a shorter light period (12 h) and the medium used may however have contributed to offsets between our study and prior research. Indeed, when O. tauri was grown under the same irradiances and photoperiod as used here, it displayed comparable growth rates as M. commoda, i.e., 0.29  0.01 d-1 at low irradiance (6 mol photon m-2 sec-1) and a max of 1.74  0.06 d-1 [52]. Growth data also exist for other prasinophytes, e.g. [53], and the chlorophyte C. reinhardtii [14,54]. However, even more extensive differences in culturing conditions make comparisons difficult, urging further comparative studies that use standardized handling, photoperiod and medium.. FALS values have previously been shown to relate to cell size and carbon content in M. commoda-like strain CCMP489 [51]. Our flow cytometry data on M. commoda strain RCC299 showed that the maximum normalized mean FALS and chlorophyll-derived red fluorescence cell-1 occurred just prior to the end of the light period, regardless of the light level (Fig 2). This indicates that cell size is the same at dawn, regardless of the light level (also likely reflecting cells being in the G1 cell cycle phase), but deviates over the remainder of the diel cycle at the different irradiances. Overall differences in chlorophyll-derived red fluorescence in cultures acclimated to different irradiances are consistent with prior work on C. reinhardtii showing that chlorophyll cell-1 is inversely proportional to irradiance level in light-acclimated cells [14,54,55]. The variations we observed over the L:D cycle for red fluorescence and FALS cell-1 are similar to those in M. pusilla CCMP490 [56], M. pusilla CCMP1545 [57] and O. tauri [58]. These patterns correlate with cell division and highlight the critical nature of light as a regulator for synchronizing photoautotrophic growth, with timing that varies according to the L:D program.. Exponentially growing M. commoda cells responded to the HL shift with a rapid increase in growth rate, that was already manifested 19.5 h after the shift by higher cell abundances than in controls (Fig 3A). Mean FALS cell-1 increased in a similar way to the control, while mean red fluorescence cell-1 was significantly lower (by 11.2  4.6%) within 2.5 h of HL exposure indicating that photoacclimation processes were underway (Fig 3B and 3D). By comparison, continuous-light grown C. reinhardtii cultures transferred from 75 mol photons m-2 s-1 to 750 mol photons m-2 s-1 increased in growth rate from 0.87 d-1 to 2.22 d-1 8 to 12 h after the shift [59]. In other studies on Chlamydomonas, red fluorescence cell-1 decreased by 20 to 60%, depending on experiments, during the first 6 h of HL exposure for cultures in continuous light [60,61] and on a L:D cycle [54]. In the latter study, decreased red fluorescence was associated with a decline in chlorophyll content, which started as early as 30 min after HL exposure. Indeed, down-regulation of light-harvesting in response to increased light is the basis of the current model of photoacclimation and growth in phytoplankton [6265]. This model involves a quick acclimation of metabolic processes, especially growth and photosynthesis, the speed of this process being likely critical for taxa that reside in highly variable aquatic environments.. While the ~6-fold increase of visible light in our HL treatment was beneficial for M. commoda growth, the concomitant shift to HL plus UV radiation was detrimental. The UV used here included UV-A, which is the more abundant species in natural sunlight, and UV-B which is increasing in some regions due to depletion of the ozone layer [66]. HL+UV had a dramatic effect on both growth and cell characteristics, i.e. FALS and red fluorescence cell-1 (Fig 4A and 4B). The spectral output of the UV-A bulb used matches the output levels of natural sunlight between 300 and 340 nm and at higher wavelengths declines to 0 W m-2 [67]. The UV-B output of the bulb used was about 3.5 fold-higher than that in natural sunlight. Both UV types will have been reduced from the bulb-output level by seawater attenuation in the experimental quartz flasks as would occur in the surface ocean conditions. Typical wind mixing of ocean surface waters causes similarly rapid shifts as those performed here. However, it is unlikely that UV exposure would be of the duration (and UV-B dose, [25]) studied here, which were designed to trigger physiological and gene expressional changes that could be unambiguously assigned to the HL+UV treatment. Micromonas populations that are in the upper photic layer for long periods prior to being shifted even closer to the surface, may be better acclimated for increased UV exposure than our cultures. Indeed, in C. reinhardtii, pre-acclimation to low levels of UV-B increases survival rates upon a shift to higher UV-B compared to cells that are not pre-acclimated [68]. Collectively, such studies are important for understanding phytoplankton responses to life in increasingly stratified water columns, a predicted outcome of global warming for some oceanic regions [69].. . . Expression changes associated with the diel cycle and light shifts. Several studies have addressed prasinophyte growth over the diel cycle with respect to timing of division and cellular characteristics [5658,70]. Fewer have investigated diel transcriptional changes of chloroplast and nuclear genes [57,71], and to our knowledge none have yet addressed expressional responses in M. commoda or prasinophyte responses to light shifts. Such studies are important for understanding basic biology of these cells and for future analyses of field metatranscriptome data. Our study followed just 2.5 h of the midday period of L:D synchronized cells, and therefore primarily addresses how cells respond to a rapid shift into HL or HL+UV. Caveats remain on the extent to which transcriptional data reflects protein level data and this affects interpretation of results. For example, rbcL expression levels did not change between treatments and controls at the same time point or at T0 (S1 Table), and this gene is known to be regulated at the translational level in C. reinhardtii [72]. More generally, several Chlamydomonas studies have not found clear diel changes in chloroplast gene expression [73,74], leading to the proposal that many are under translational control, in sharp contrast with patterns in cyanobacteria where nearly all genes are expressed rhythmically (see e.g. [75,76]). In addition, a comparative proteomic/transcriptomic study of M. pusilla found a significant number of hypothetically post-transcriptionally regulated (HPTR) genes, although the focus was not on chloroplast genes [77]. Finally, the UV exposure used here was clearly inhibitory to growth of M. commoda. Thus, it is important to consider that inhibition of growth removes an important carbon and energy sink that could influence the acclimation potential of the cells in our HL+UV treatment. The changes observed in the HL+UV treatment could therefore reflect more indirect effects of the stressor, short-circuiting acclimation mechanisms for accommodating UV stress, rather than direct effects. With these caveats in mind, we discuss the more notable gene expression patterns observed in our study.. . . Acclimative changes in genes for photosynthesis and light-harvesting machinery. We investigated a suite of photosynthetic antenna-related proteins, encoded by genes on the nuclear genome, as well as chloroplast encoded genes involved in photosynthesis. A study on M. pusilla showed that many components of the photosynthetic machinery encoded on the nuclear genome that are associated with the structure of PSII and PSI have clear diurnal expression patterns, with peak expression at the dark-to-light transition [57]. But that study did not investigate changes in LHC genes or genes on the chloroplast genome. Additionally, M. pusilla differs from M. commoda in having phytochrome, a light sensor regulatory protein, which has been implicated in timing of the dawn expression of photosynthetic machinery [57]. The nuclear genomes of both M. pusilla and M. commoda contain genes for chloroplast-targeted PSI-associated LHCs (LHCA1-4, LHCA5-like), minor polypeptides of PSII (LHCB4, LHCB5.1 also known as CP29 and CP26, respectively; CP24 is absent) and prasinophyte-specific LHCs (LHCP1, LHCP2.12.7, LHCP3, LHCP4) that are likely analogous to the PSII-associated major LHCB proteins of plants [34,35,78]. Most LHC protein-encoding genes analyzed here did not change significantly in the control or HL treatment apart from small increases associated with the diel cycle in LHCP2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 (Fig 5). Exceptions in the HL-shift were for LHCA1, LHCP2.5, and LHCP3 which showed 2 to 4-fold increases relative to T0 2.5 h after the shift (Fig A in S1 File), suggesting a central role in adjusting photon collection to a stimulatory light-shift. The minimal responses observed for the LHC genes may in part be due to the midday period investigated. In M. pusilla, nucleus-encoded photosynthesis-related genes exhibited highest expression early in the day with lower levels at time points similar to those sampled here (later in the light-period) [57]. Furthermore, as observed here for LHCB5.1, under HL Arabidopsis, Chlamydomonas and Ostreococcus showed more notable effects on the minor polypeptides of the PSII antenna, which channel energy towards the reaction centers by linking the outer LHCII antennae to reaction centers [22,79,80]. In Chlamydomonas, significant transcriptional downregulation has been documented for both LHCB4 (CP29), e.g. by 7580% within 1 h of HL exposure, and LHCB5 (CP26) under HL stress [59,61,81,82]. Changes in expression levels of M. commoda chloroplast photosynthesis genes were also minor in HL relative to controls (Fig 5, Fig A in S1 File).. Chloroplast genes involved in translation responded differently in the control and HL than those directly involved in photosynthetic machinery. No translation-related genes increased in expression in the control along the time course (which started 4.5 h into the light period), and most showed diel-based reductions (Fig 5). The same was observed for the HL treatment but with an earlier onset (Fig 5). Likewise, in O. tauri, the expression of genes encoding chloroplast ribosomal proteins was shown to be co-regulated during the photoperiod, and to decrease starting about 3 h after the onset of the light period [71]. Furthermore, O. tauri nuclear- and chloroplast- ribosomal genes were expressed at different times of the day (i.e., the nucleus genes were more highly expressed at the end of the dark period) [71], speaking to the fundamentally different roles these two gene suites have, and to aspects of autonomy retained by the plastid.. Finally, the general lack of change in expression of genes coding for energy metabolism proteins in the HL treatment (only atpF declined; Fig 5) indicated that levels of ATP synthase and cytochrome b6f per chlorophyll were higher in cultures shifted to HL. In C. reinhardtii, only slight and non-significant changes were observed after a shift to HL in the relative amount of most proteins coded for by these genes [55]. Moreover, when protein content was normalized to chlorophyll content, cytochrome b6f and ATP synthase over-accumulated in HL [55]. M. commoda cells in the HL treatment may therefore have had higher capacity in linear electron transport which could have produced the increase in ATP production necessary for facilitating the observed increase in growth rate. Overall, M. commoda transcriptional responses to the HL treatment were small (Fig 5, Fig A in S1 File) and this is consistent with the 6-fold increase in light intensity being stimulatory, not photoinhibitory. These results suggest that M. commoda is well adapted for growth under high light levels as well as rapid shifts in irradiance, as commonly encountered in the upper sunlit layer of oceans, and is able to immediately translate light-availability into increased growth rate.. . . HL+UV induced responses of photosynthesis and antennae genes. In contrast to results for the controls and HL shift, dramatic reductions were observed for multiple genes in the HL+UV treatment. Decreases in expression of translation-related genes were of a larger magnitude in HL+UV than in the HL treatment or the control. Additionally, in HL+UV most of the six ATP synthase genes showed significantly decreased expression, while the expression of genes coding for cytochrome b6f were little or un-affected. Cytochrome f is also considered a stable protein [8385], potentially explaining the slight decrease of petA gene expression with regard to the other two pet genes (Fig 5). These results suggest that in M. commoda cells, UV radiation induces a dramatic reduction of the de novo synthesis of ATP synthase but not of the b6f complex, possibly implying that ATP production is more strongly affected by UV. HL+UV also induced an immediate reduction in all major components of the PSII and PSI associated antennae (all LHCA, LHCB and LHCP genes) even though several PSI and PSII associated genes were not strongly effected at the transcriptional level (Fig 5). The latter included psbA which codes for the D1 protein (Fig 5) and is considered the most rapidly turned-over chloroplast protein, with even faster turn over than nucleus-encoded LHC proteins [86,87]. Our expression data on M. commoda suggest that UV did not significantly alter D1 synthesis and repair, but could still strongly affect PSII activity, given the large apparent decrease in chlorophyll-derived red fluorescence cell-1. In C. reinhardtii, UV causes 25% lower D1 protein levels after 1.5 h of exposure and also lower levels (to a lesser extent) of the D2 protein while neither was significantly degraded in controls [88]. PSII activity under UV was also reduced dramatically (by 72%) compared to the control. Reduction in C. reinhardtii D1 and D2 protein levels are most severe for non-UV acclimated cells. Cells first acclimated to low levels of UV-B show higher levels and faster re-synthesis of D1 and D2 protein, and greater survival rates after being shifted to a higher UV-B dose [68]. Our goal here was to identify for the first time genes involved in the biological responses of M. commoda to HL+UV. The significant reduction in chlorophyll-derived red fluorescence cell-1 that accompanied these expressional changes is suggestive of pigment photobleaching, and M. commoda did not divide during the experiment, even though UV exposure ceased at the end of the light period. These changes to cell characteristics, growth and transcription are indicative of a massive initial reprogramming to compensate for the UV dose but nevertheless the changes failed to support continued growth.. . . Molecular evidence for LHCSR-based NPQ in Micromonas. Considerable attention has been given to the LHCSR protein [1416,55,89]. This protein is responsible for one of the key NPQ mechanisms that allow excess light energy to be dissipated as heat. Although our RNA-seq data did not meet the criteria for differential expression analysis, the qPCR results suggest that M. commodas LHCSR2 is triggered similarly to LHCSR3 in Chlamydomonas. We observed a modest, transient increase in LHCSR2 expression after 1 h and a subsequent reduction at T2.5 in HL in M. commoda (Fig 4). Likewise, in Chlamydomonas, LHCSR3 expression increased within 30 min of transfer to HL and then declined within 1 to 3 h of exposure to HL [20]. LHCSR and a number of other photoprotective LIL genes (PSBS1, PSBS2, ELIP1, ELIP5 and LHL4) also increased by >10-fold in C. reinhardtii following 1 h UV-B exposure [68]. Here, HL+UV induced an increase of over 30-fold at T1 and 40-fold by T2.5 (Fig 5). Our results constitute the first experimental evidence that LHCSR-genes are transcriptionally activated in Micromonas by HL and HL+UV. This suggests that LHCSR-mediated NPQ plays a role in accommodating increased light-energy (HL treatment) and photoinhibitory stress (HL+UV) in M. commoda and likely prasinophytes as a whole.. . . Stress-related, lesser known and unique genes exhibiting significant changes. Nuclear encoded LIL proteins in Micromonas primarily belong to the OHP and ELIP families, which have different numbers of helices [13,34,78]. In plants and algae, OHPs have one helix while ELIPs have three helices and are thought to have photoprotective functions involving potential binding of chlorophylls released during HL stress [1,13,61]. Multiple ELIP genes (six ELIPs and one FAS-ELIP) are present in the M. commoda genome, raising the question of possible redundant functions. Here, only M. commodas CBR-ELIP7 and FAS-ELIP could be analyzed (see methods). Both proteins have the three helix structures known from most ELIPs [13,34] plus additional domains. They exhibited large significant increases in the shift to HL+UV, but not in the controls or HL. The magnitude of response was lower for the FAS-ELIP, that encodes a unique protein found thus far only in the Mamiellophyceae based on available genomic data. It combines the chlorophyll a/b binding domain (at the C-terminus, three helices) with a Beta-Ig-H3/fasciclin domain (at the N-terminus, following the predicted transit peptide). Other proteins containing the latter domain are present in M. commoda, but not in this fused arrangement. In plants and animals, this domain appears to be involved in cell adhesion and development, but a function in single celled organisms has not been described. Neilson and Durnford hypothesized that the domain has been co-opted to facilitate protein-protein interactions or act as part of a signaling pathway [13]. The responses observed here constitute the first report of differential expression of a gene encoding a fusion protein with these domains.. The LHL gene of M. commoda has homology with the LHL4 gene of Chlamydomonas which encodes a three-helix protein whose expression is thought to be mediated by a blue/UV-A light receptor [90]. This LIL protein is present in other chlorophytes and prasinophytes but, unlike ELIPs and OHPs, does not have known homologs in vascular plants [61]. High M. commoda LHL expression under the shift to HL+UV (Fig 5) corresponds to responses in C. reinhardtii under UV exposure. We also observed a transient increase in expression relative to T0 for the HL treatment. In general, the response of this gene mirrored that of the ELIPs and OHPs analyzed here in M. commoda.. OHPs are thought to be more strictly related to light stress than ELIPs [12,91]. Here, the only change observed in the control and HL for the two Micromonas OHP genes was a transient slight (but significant) decrease in OHP2 1 h into the HL shift. This change was evident in both the RNA-seq (Fig 5) and qPCR (Fig 4E) data. Thus, it appears that the growth stimulatory HL used during our experiments does not induce increased expression of either OHP gene. However, in the HL+UV treatment we observed large increases in OHP1 (in RNA-seq) and OHP2 (10- to 50-fold within 2.5 h) transcript levels by both RNA-seq and qPCR. In A. thaliana, homologs of the M. commodas OHP2 are localized in the thylakoid membranes and the accumulation of OHP2 transcripts (and protein) has so far been associated with HL shifts, since other stresses such as UV-A, heat, cold, desiccation or oxidative stress did not result in expressional changes [92]. Other studies have reported up-regulation of the Arabidopsis OHP1 gene under HL [93] and in C. reinhardtii OHP1 (LHL2) was induced within 1 h after a shift from LL to HL, and then decreased to initial levels within 6 h [61]. While cyanobacteria lack ELIPs, they do have one-helix proteins (termed HLIPs), and these hli genes increase in expression under both HL and UV-B stress [11,94,95]. Our results indicate that in M. commoda the induction of OHP2 is more sensitive to UV radiation than the stimulatory HL used here. Our data supports the proposal that in eukaryotes OHPs are essential for photoprotection against UV radiation, which is also thought to activate specific receptors in plants [92].. Changes were also observed for M. commoda genes that have recently described or uncharacterized functions. Among chloroplast genes, the protein encoded by ycf12 (Psb30) has now been demonstrated to serve as a PSII reaction center subunit in C. reinhardtii [96]. We saw a transient increase in ycf12 expression when cells were shifted to HL and a large reduction in the HL+UV treatment. These results fit with Ycf12 being required for optimal PSII functioning under HL. The Ycf1 protein of M. commoda is highly divergent from those of plants, making assignment of function more tentative than for Ycf12. Ycf1 decreased in expression in association with the diel cycle in the control, and this decrease was accelerated in the HL treatment (transient; Fig 5). These patterns were most similar to those of tufa, which codes for an elongation factor (Fig 5). In A. thaliana, Ycf1 encodes Tic214, part of the translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (TIC) complex that facilitates transiting of proteins encoded on the nuclear genome into the chloroplast [97,98]. TIC is necessary for viability in A. thaliana and presumably other plants and green algae. If Ycf1 does have the same function in M. commoda, then the fact that its response is similar to that of an elongation factor further emphasizes the strong diurnal patterns connected to the L:D cycle, timing of translocation to the chloroplast, and resulting synchronized growth in photosynthetic organisms.. Finally, the N-terminal region of the novel NIRFU fusion protein is homologous to plant NIR proteins (nitrite reductase). Six electrons in total are required to reduce nitrite to ammonia which can then be used in downstream steps of the nitrogen assimilation pathway of photosynthetic organisms [99,100]. The electron accumulation in plant NIR occurs in one-electron steps because ferredoxin is a one electron donor and the enzyme contains just one ferredoxin binding site [99,100]. However, the full NIRFU protein contains NIR fused to predicted domains for rubredoxin, which can act as an electron transfer protein [101], and the ferredoxin reductase superfamily domain (FNR, cytochrome b5 reductase-like). Apart from M. commoda, this fusion protein only appears to be present in O. tauri, B. prasinos and M. pusilla based on blastp queries against available plant and algal genomes (GenBank nr database). Although the three-dimensional structure and function of NIRFU is not known, some aspects of the combination of domains have similarities to bacterial nitrite reductase operons. The cytochrome c nitrite reductase (nrfA) operon of several non-photosynthetic bacteria contains not only nrfA (which encodes the catalytic subunit), but also nrfH, encoding a tetraheme cytochrome c [102]. Together, these form a complex that optimizes the efficiency of electron transfer to nitrite, the terminal acceptor [102]. We hypothesize that the additional domains in NIRFU enhance the efficiency of electron transfer over classical plant NIR proteins, potentially with both ferredoxin and NAD(P)H dependent nitrite reduction in the chloroplast. The culture medium used for our M. commoda experiments had nitrate as the primary nitrogen source. While NIRFU expression went down in HL+UV, consistent with a cessation of growth and the associated demand for ammonia, NIRFU expression increased dramatically by 1 h in the HL treatment (note that expression of nitrate reductase could not be evaluated). This may indicate that these picoprasinophytes use NIRFU to rapidly increase the supply of ammonia to the nitrogen assimilation pathway, fueling enhanced rates of growth under sudden changes in light availability.. . . . Conclusions. Our results suggest that M. commoda is well adapted for growth under HL levels encountered in surface waters of aquatic environments. Photoinhibitory processes due to UV may be counteracted in part by increased synthesis of LHCSR2, which exhibited >30-fold higher gene expression, and upregulation of other potential compensatory mechanisms (e.g., products of HSP and LIL genes) that did not change significantly with HL alone. It appears that M. commoda responds to HL by transient dissipation of excess energy, then by launching changes in the antennae complex that were manifested in decreased levels of chlorophyll-derived red-fluorescence per cell within 2.5 hours. Despite a six-fold increase in light intensity, no adjustment was apparent at the transcriptional level in the HL treatment relative to controls for chloroplast genes (apart from a few components of PSII, including D1 protein, and translation related proteins), or most antennae related proteins encoded on the nuclear genome. These results may indicate that post-translational controls act on the gene suites that did not exhibit expressional changes, such that the RNA-seq was not reflective of downstream protein modifications. Overall, we observed an immediate capacity of M. commoda to accommodate the rapid shift in light level, resulting in increased growth rate on the same day as the shift in these diel studies. Although further comparative studies with other taxa are needed, these findings translate to a level of environmental flexibility that may contribute to the success of M. commoda, and possibly the entire genus, in a variable marine water column.. . .

PMC5339335	Introduction. Diet-related non-infectious chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and certain colon and rectum cancers, are major causes of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries (Regina et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2012). Around 600 million people are estimated to live with diabetes in 2035 (Unwin et al., 2013). Resistant starch (RS) is a kind of starch or starch products that are not digestible and absorbed in the stomach or small intestine and passed on directly to the large intestine (Asp, 1992). A cereal grain higher in amylose content (AC) is always a good source of RS (Jiang et al., 2010). Cereals high in RS are benefit to improve human health and to reduce the risk of those serious non-infectious diseases (Regina et al., 2006). Consumption of RS could lead to a decreased glycemic index (GI), which represents the rise of blood sugar level following carbohydrate ingestion, and could also prevent the development of non-reversible insulin resistance in healthy individuals and diabetics, and thus decrease the incidence and mitigate the severity of type II diabetes (Giacco et al., 1998; Hoebler et al., 1999; Vonk et al., 2000). RS also produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which help to keep colon tissue healthier. The acetic, propionic, and butyric acids which composed the SCFA are beneficial to lower the intestinal pH, inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, and encourage beneficial bacteria to grow in the bowel (Regmi et al., 2011). Although a high AC diet is highly desirable and healthier food for some consumers, cereal crops higher in AC are not widely available (Zhu et al., 2012). Thus, there is an increasing need to develop cereal crops high in RS to meet rapidly growing challenges in nutrition for public health at population level (Regina et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2012; Li and Gilbert, 2016).. Rice is one of the major staple food crops consumed by nearly half of the world population. Each year, about 4.5 million hectares of rice are grown worldwide. In Asia, rice and its processed products provide 6070% daily calories for over 2 billion people (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], 2004). And about 90% of a milled rice kernel is starch. Starch consists of glucose polymers, amylose and amylopectin, which are polymerized through -1, 4 and -1, 6 linkages. Amylose has infrequent -1, 6 linkages and a lower degree of polymerization (DP), whereas amylopectin is a large highly branched polysaccharide with higher DP. In cooked foods, amylose molecules re-associate rapidly to form a precipitate or gel upon cooling, forming complexes which resist digestion, whereas the re-associate rate of amylopectin molecules are slowly and thus the formed complexes are more readily digestible. Therefore, high-amylose products always have higher RS content (Regina et al., 2006). Amylose and amylopectin are synthesized via two different pathways. The synthesis of amylose requires an active granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), whereas amylopectin is a product of a complex pathway which involves different isoforms of starch synthase (SS), starch branching enzymes (SBEs), and starch-debranching enzymes (SDBEs) (Ball and Morell, 2003). SBEs catalyze the cleavage of and transfer of -1, 4-linked glucan chain and subsequent conjugate the part of that chain to the 6-hydroxyl groups along another chain, thus produce branches in amylopectin (Syahariza et al., 2013).. Analyses of the ACs of a set of germplasm collected by the International Rice Research Institute showed that AC in wild and cultivated rice ranges from 0 to 30% depending on the rice variety (Butardo et al., 2008). In rice endosperm, there exist at least three isoforms of SBEs, SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb. SBEIIa and SBEIIb share 80% sequence identity (Mizuno et al., 1992; Nakamura et al., 1992). SBEIIa is prodominantly expressed in leaves, while SBEIIb is mainly expressed in the rice grains (Yamanouchi and Nakamura, 1992; Ohdan et al., 2005; Yamakawa et al., 2007). SBEIIb is a major SBEII isoform in the rice endosperm (Yamanouchi and Nakamura, 1992). To further increase the AC, one can direct the starch synthesis toward amylose production through either overexpressing a suitable GBSS (Waxy) allele (Hanashiro et al., 1996; Itoh et al., 2003), or suppressing the expression of enzymes involved in amylopectin biosynthesis (Morell and Myers, 2005; Regina et al., 2006; Rahman et al., 2007). High amylose maize, wheat, and barley were achieved through down-regulation of SBEII (Boyer and Preiss, 1978; Satoh et al., 2003; Regina et al., 2006, 2010). In rice, high amylose sbeIIb mutants were generated by means of chemical treatment or radiation (Yano et al., 1985; Kim et al., 2005; Shu et al., 2006), or through hairpin RNA (hp-RNA) mediated RNA interference (RNAi) (Ossowski et al., 2008; Warthmann et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2010; Butardo et al., 2011). However, chemical or physical radiation induced mutations might be accompanied by undesired and uncharacterized mutations in the whole genome (Yano et al., 1985; Asaoka et al., 1986). Furthermore, RNAi-mediated interference of gene expression is often incomplete and the transgene expression varies in different lines. In addition, the transgenic lines are regarded as genetically modified and are subject to costly and time-consuming regulatory processes (Shan et al., 2015).. Genome editing technologies enable precise modifications of DNA sequences in vivo and offer a great promise for harnessing plant genes in crop improvement (Shan et al., 2013; Puchta and Fauser, 2014; Voytas and Gao, 2014; Li et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015; Svitashev et al., 2015; Endo et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2016b). CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated Cas9 endonuclease) has revolutionized genome editing because of its specificity, simplicity, and versatility (Cong et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2014; Gao and Zhao, 2014; Zhou et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2015; Li J. et al., 2016; Paul and Qi, 2016; Sun et al., 2016a). The Cas9 protein functions as a nuclease and is directed to a target site by an engineered sequence-specific single guide RNA (gRNA). This site-specific targeting is determined by the first 20 nucleotides (target seed sequence) of the gRNA for the DNA recognition (Jinek et al., 2012). CRISPR/Cas9 induces site-specific double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can be then repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). NHEJ is error-prone and often introduces small insertions or deletions (indels) at cleavage sites, frequently generating frame-shifted knockout mutations (Jinek et al., 2012).. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing technology has the potential to greatly facilitate plant breeding. However, so far only a very few examples of improvement of agronomic important traits and creation of novel germplasm in crop plants have been reported (Ma et al., 2015; Svitashev et al., 2015; Li M. et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2016a,b). For example, through CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing, substitution of P165 with Serine in the ALS2 gene using either double-stranded DNA vectors or single-stranded oligonucleotides as repair templates yielded chlorsulfuron resistant maize plants (Svitashev et al., 2015). The replacement of a 5 untranslated region of the ARGOS8 gene by a native GOS2 promoter resulted in increased grain yield by five bushels per acre under stress conditions in maize (Shi et al., 2016). In rice, targeted mutagenesis of rice OsWaxy (GBSS) gene by CRISPR/Cas9 led to the AC decreased from 14.6 to 2.6%, a phenotype similar to a natural glutinous rice variety (Ma et al., 2015). Mutants of Gn1a, DEP1, GS3, and IPA1 genes, which function as regulators of yield parameters such as grain number, panicle architecture, grain size, and plant architecture, were generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis, respectively (Li M. et al., 2016). In our previous study, multiple herbicide resistant rice plants were successfully achieved by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HR for simultaneous in planta substitutions of two amino acid residues in acetolactate synthase (Sun et al., 2016b).. Here, we report the feasibility to create transgene-free high amylose rice plants through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated target gene editing of SBEIIb and SBEI. We defined the roles of SBEI and SBEIIb in determining the AC, fine structure of amylopectin, and physiochemical properties of starch. This work enables the improvement of nutritional properties of starch in rice grain, thus potentially providing health benefits to many people.. . . Materials and Methods. . Construction of the CRISPR/Cas9-Related Vectors. The vectors used in this study were based on the vector pCXUN-Cas9 in which the codon-optimized Cas9 was driven by the ubiquitin gene promoter of maize (Zea mays L.). The backbone of pCXUN-Cas9 contains a hygromycin resistant gene (hptII) for callus selection. The PmeI in pCXUN-Cas9 were used for introducing the gRNAs expression cassettes.. The gRNA expression cassettes were synthesized by overlapping PCR. Target-specific sequence of gRNA1 (target SBEI) or gRNA2 (target SBEIIb) were put at the 5-end of primers SBEI-F1/SBEI-R1 and SBEIIb-F1/SBEIIb-R1, respectively. Because OsU3 promoter sequences were used in this experiment, we also placed an A at the first nucleotide of the target sequence. Two PCR reactions were performed by using the plasmid pOsU3-gRNA as a template. The first PCR was performed using primer set hrpme-u3F/SBEI-R1, and the second one used primer set SBEIIb-F1/hrpme-u3R (Supplementary Table S2). Products of PCR 1 and 2 were used as templates for the third PCR reaction with the primer set hrpme-u3F/hrpme-u3R to generate the full length gRNA1 fragment (Supplementary Table S2). The same procedure was used to obtain the gRNA2 fragment by using the primer sets SBEIIb-F1, hrpme-u3R, and hrpme-u3F and SBEIIb-R1 (Supplementary Table S2). At the 5-end of the primer pairs of hrpme-u3F/ hrpme-u3R, the sequences are homologous to the sequences outsides of Pme I sites in pCXUN-Cas9, respectively. Then, gRNA1 and gRNA2 fragments were cloned to the linearized pCXUN-Cas9 with Pme I, by using pEASY-Uni Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China).. . . Agrobacterium-Mediated Rice Transformation. The vectors described above were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 by electroporation. Transformation of rice calli was performed as described by Hiei et al. (1994). The calli derived from japonica cv. Kitaake were selected on media containing 50 mg/L hygromycin for 4 weeks. Then the vigorously grown calli were transferred to regeneration media to generate green plants.. . . Molecular Characterization of the Mutant Plants. Rice genomic DNA was extracted by using a DNA Quick Plant System (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). 50 ng of genomic DNA were used as a template to perform PCR amplification using Taq polymerase (Tiangen, Beijing, China). The primer sets RC11-F/RC11-R and RC33-F/RC33-R were designed to flank the designated target sites. The PCR products amplified by the primer sets RC11-F/RC11-R and RC33-F/RC33-R were digested with Cac8 I and Dde I, respectively. Then the undigested band was recovered and directly sequenced to screen for the plants with mutations in SBEI or SBEIIb. The sequence chromatograms were analyzed by a web-based tool1 to check the genotype and zygosity of the tested plants. PCR products were also cloned into the TA cloning vector P-easy (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and 10 positive colonies were sequenced for each sample. The PCR primer sets used for the PCR/RE assay and detection of the presence of Cas9 and gRNA were as listed in Supplementary Table S2. T1 homozygous sbeI and sbeIIb mutant lines derived from either T0 homozygotes or bi-allelic lines were subjected to further analyses.. . . Measurement of Grain Composition and Molecular Structure of Starch. The harvested mature panicles were dried at 37C for at least 3 days. Thousand-grain weights (g) of selected lines were weighed in triplicate. The SeedCount (SeedCount, Australasia, Pty, Ltd) was used to determine grain appearance and dimensions. The opacity of seeds was investigated using the chalkiness index following the standard of Australian rice industry. Leitz M8 stereomicroscope was used to take photomicrographs of whole brown grain samples.. The granular morphology of starch was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Grain samples were transversely cut and mounted on circular aluminum stubs with double-sided sticky tape. Samples were examined and photographed by FEI Quanta 450 (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA).. The total starch, AC and RS in the brown rice flour were measured with the starch assay kits Megazyme K-STAR, K-AMYL and K-RSTAR (Megazyme, Wicklow, Ireland)2.. To analyze the chain length distributions (CLDs) of amylopectin, 25 mg of rice powder was digested with isoamylase (Megazyme, Wicklow, Ireland2) at 37C for 24 h for release of the N-linked oligosaccharides. After release, the oligosaccharides were labeled with a fluorophore called 8-aminopyrene-1, 3, 6, 6-trisulfonate. For measurement of the stoichiometry, each labeling reaction is composed of one APTS molecule per molecule of oligosaccharide. Added maltose quantitative control/mobility marker and then analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (PA800 plus pharmaceutical analysis system, Carbohydrate labeling and analysis, Beckman Coulter, America)3.. . . Measurement of Pasting and Gelatinization Properties. Three grams of brown rice flour (0.5 mm or less, 14% moisture basis) was put in 25 ml of distilled water and mixed. The sample was measured by Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA Techmaster, Newport Scientific, Narrabeen, NSW, Australia), according to the America Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) Approved Method 61-02.01 (AACC, 1995). The gelatinization of rice flour in urea solutions was determined as described by Nishi et al. (2001).. The sample which finished RVA analysis was cool down to room temperature, then stored at 4C and relative humidity 75% for 24 h for retrogradation. The retrograded cooked rice flour was performed texture profile analysis (TPA) analysis. The hardness, gumminess and chewiness were measured using a texture analyzer with 25N load cell with a two-cycle compression (TMS-Pro, Food technology corporation, American). The deformation level was 70% of original sample height and the partly broken rice was compressed again.. For the gelatinization temperature and enthalpy analysis, 5 mg of brown rice flour was mixed with 10 L of distilled water and placed inside an aluminum sample cup, and sealed, and then the samples were analyzed by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC1 STARe system, METTLER TOLEDO, Switzerland).. . . Measurement of Reducing Sugar and Pentosan. The in vitro digestibility of rice flour was determined as described by Englyst et al. (1992) with minor modifications. The rice flour 50 mg weighed in screw-capped tubes, 4 ml of sodium acetate buffer (0.5 M, pH = 5.2) and 1 ml (3 U/ml) pancreatic -amylase (Megazyme, Wicklow, Ireland) were added to each tube. The sample was incubated in a shaking water bath (200 rpm) at 37C. Aliquots (0.5 ml) were taken at intervals and mixed with 0.5 ml (1.2 M) of acetic acid to terminate the reaction. After centrifugation (2000 rpm, 10 min), the reducing sugar content released in the supernatant from each sample was measured using 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid. Total pentosan content was examined as described by Butardo et al. (2011).. . . Statistical Analysis. Grain morphology and starch physiochemical properties of different mutant lines were analyzed by using a one-way variance analysis (ANOVA). The differences were examined using a Students t-test. Significance (P-value) was evaluated at the 1 or 5% level for all comparisons. For each treatment, the standard error of the mean (SEM) was calculated based on at least three biological replicates. For the 2 test, P > 0.5 were considered to be very good agreement with expected segregation ratio.. . . . Results. . CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Targeted Mutagenesis of SBEI and SBEIIb in Rice. We targeted the first exon of SBEI (GenBank Accession no GQ150904.1) and the third exon of SBEIIb (GenBank Accession no GQ150916.1) (Figure 1A). Both targets contained restriction sites that were used for screening mutations using PCR-based restriction enzyme (PCR/RE) digestion assay (Figure 1A). We placed the gRNA cassette into the binary vector pCXUN (Figure 1B). We transformed the CRISPR/Cas9 vectors into rice embryogenic calli through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and generated transgenic lines after two rounds of hygromycin selection. In total, we obtained 32 sbeI mutant rice plants from 40 hygromycin-resistant transgenic plants. Our PCR/RE assay and sequence analyses indicated that, of these 40 transgenic plants, 12.5, 27.5, and 40.0% were heterozygous, bi-allelic, and homozygous sbeI mutant lines, respectively (Figures 1C,E and Table 1). For SBEIIb, 21 sbeIIb mutant plants were recovered from 30 independent transgenic plants regenerated, with a frequency of 6.7, 36.6, and 26.7% for heterozygous, bi-allelic, and homozygous lines, respectively (Figures 1D,F and Table 1). Consistent with previous CRISPR/Cas9 studies (Feng et al., 2014), we found that the majorities of the mutations identified in the mutant lines were small deletions or insertions near the target sites (Figures 1E,F and Table 1). However, some mutants harbored large insertions such as the sbeI-c28 and sbeIIb-c3 mutant lines, which had a 64 and 248 bp insertion at the target sites, respectively (Figures 1E,F). Interestingly, the inserted sequences were derived from the vector used in this study in these both cases.. . FIGURE 1. . CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in the SBEI and SBEIIb genes.

We further investigated if off-target effects occurred in our experiments. Based on the predictions of the CRISPR-P tool4, we identified the potential off-target sites for SBEI and SBEIIb genes. We used site-specific genomic PCR and Sanger sequencing to determine whether the predicted off-target sites were also edited. As shown in Supplementary Table S1, no mutations were detected at the putative off-target loci in rice genome in T0 and T1 offspring of these obtained mutant lines.. . . Inheritance and Stability of the Identified Mutations and Generation of Transgene-Free Mutant Rice Lines. To investigate whether the mutations generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing were heritable, we analyzed the segregation patterns at T1 generation. T0 mutant plants were self-pollinated and the resulting T1 plants were used for segregation analysis (Table 2). We randomly selected 15 to 37 T1 progenies derived from each T0 plant for genotyping analysis (Table 2). We found that all of the mutations detected in T0 plants were transmitted to the T1 generation without the occurrence of new mutations (data not shown). All T1 plants from T0 homozygotes were homozygous for the same mutations. Bi-allelic mutations in T0 plants were apparently transmitted to T1 generation in a Mendelian fashion. For example, sbeI-c31 was a bi-allelic line with a 1 bp deletion (d1) and an 8 bp deletion (d8). Among the 37 T1 plants analyzed, 9 contained d1, 17 were bi-allelic (d1/d8), and 11 were d8, consistent with the predicted Mendelian segregation (2 test, P > 0.05). We also noticed some rare segregation patterns. For example, mutations in sbeIIb-c3 showed a non-Mendelian segregation ratio of 1:1, which may be caused by aberrant gamete or seed formation.. .

In d#, the # refers to the number of bp deleted from the target site; i#a or i#b, # refers to the number of bp inserted at target sites with different nucleotide or different positions (a or b). According to the 2 test, P > 0.5, means in very good agreement with expected Mendelian segregation ratio; N.A, not applicable. For transgene analysis, + represents that Cas9/gRNA/hptII was detected and - shows Cas9/gRNA/hptII not detected. Some of the T0 lines such as sbe-c1 had only one T-DNA insertion as demonstrated by around 1/3 of Cas9/gRNA/hptII-free plants in T1 progenies, whereas sbeI-c6 T0 plant probably had two T-DNA insertions because only about 1/12 of T1 plants were Cas9/gRNA/hptII free. The failures to identify Cas9/gRNA/hptII-free plants at T1 generation for some lines were probably due to either multiple insertions or tight linkage to the mutations.. . . . To determine whether plasmid DNA sequences, especially Cas9, gRNAs, and hptII sequences, were present in these mutant lines, we performed PCR amplification using the primer sets designed to specifically amplify Cas9, gRNAs, and hptII sequences, respectively (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S2). Among the 12 T0 mutant lines analyzed, 11 contained gRNAs and Cas9 sequences. We were able to recover transgene-free mutants at T1 generation. Interestingly, sbeI-c40 mutant line did not contain Cas9, gRNA, and hptII sequences at both T0 and T1 generations, suggesting that this line escaped from hygromycin selection and the mutations in this line were generated through transient expression of Cas9/gRNA. We also noticed that the indels in sbeIIb-c3 mutant line was homozygous and was caused by an insertion of part of the pCXUN-Cas9 backbone sequences; therefore, these plants are not suitable for future applications. SbeI-c28 was a bi-allelic line with a 1 bp deletion (d1) and a 64 bp insertion (i64) which was derived from pCXUN-Cas9 backbone sequences. However, we were able to recover homozygous plants with only 1 bp of deletion and transgene-free T1 plants (Table 2). Among the rest nine T0 lines tested, Cas9/gRNA and hptII transgene-free plants were successfully recovered from four T0 mutant lines such as two lines for SBEI (sbeI-c6 and sbeI-c31) and another two lines for SBEIIb (sbeIIb-c1 and sbeIIb-c15), in the T1 generation following segregation (Figures 2B,C and Table 2), indicating that transgene-free mutants could be generated with targeted mutagenesis in SBEI and SBEIIb in rice even in a single generation. More transgene-free plants will be expected in the following generations given that the transgene will segregate following a Mendelian model.. . FIGURE 2. . Isolation of transgene-free T1 plants from the sbeI-c31 and sbeIIb-c1 mutant lines.

(B) and sbeIIb-c1 lines (C) T0 lines may contain CRISPR/Cas9 complex in their genome. However, self-pollination of T0 lines allows the removal of the T-DNA following segregation in the T1 generation plants. DNA fragments of OsU3:gRNA, Cas9 and hptII were not detected in some T1 plants of sbeI-c31 lines (Number 4, 6, 7, 13, 14, and 19) (B) and T1 plants of sbeIIb-c1 (Number 4, 11, 17 and 18) (C), respectively. The control PCR product was amplified from the endogenous ACTIN gene, indicating that the genomic DNAs used have sufficient quality for PCR. WT, wild type DNA control.. . . . . . Effects of sbe Mutations on Morphology of Grain and Starch Granule. Brown grains of 12 T1 homozygous sbeI and sbeIIb mutant lines derived from either T0 homozygotes or bi-allelic lines were used to analyze the grain and starch granule morphology. Brown grains of sbeIIb mutant lines were opaque throughout, while the sbeI mutant lines were chalky. In contrast, grains of wild type appeared uniformly translucent (Figures 3A,B). The weight, width, and thickness of grains from sbeIIb mutant lines were significantly lower than those of wild type, whereas no significant differences were observed between sbeI mutant lines and wild type control (Table 3). It is worth to mention that we did not observe obvious starch granule morphological changes in the grains of T1 homozygous plants of sbeI-c40 with 6 bp deletion (d6), which were progenies from T0. sbeI-c40 bi-allelic line with i1/d6 mutations, indicating that the in-frame deletion of six nucleotides is likely to still produce functional SBEI protein. However, obvious alternations in both the appearance of brown grains and morphology of the starch granules in comparison with the wild type were observed in a T1 homozygous line sbeIIb-c3 with d5/i248 mutations (Figure 1F), probably because the large in-frame indels (deletions or insertions) disrupted the function of target gene.. .

We also analyzed the morphology of starch granules using SEM. Starch granules from sbeIIb mutant lines were heterogeneous in size and shape, with large spaces in between, and without compound granular organization. The starch granules from sbeI lines were big, rounded, and irregularly arranged. In contrast, the starch granules of wild type were compact, compound, and angular (Figure 3C). Changes in starch granule morphology were more pronounced in sbeIIb mutant lines than that in sbeI lines. The surfaces of both wild type and the sbeI mutant granules were smooth with no or few structural debris (Figure 3C).. . . Impact of sbe Mutations on Starch Structures. The total starch contents in the polished grains of both sbeI and sbeIIb mutant lines were comparable to that of the wild type (Figure 4A). However, sbeIIb mutant lines produced grains with much more amylose compared to sbeI mutant lines and wild type (25 vs. 15%) (Students t-test, P < 0.01) (Figure 4B). The ratio of amylose/amylopectin was also increased significantly in sbeIIb mutant lines (Students t-test, P < 0.01) (Figure 4C). More importantly, all sbeIIb mutant lines displayed altered CLDs of debranched starches. The grains of sbeIIb mutant lines had a significant increase in the ratio of amylopectin longer chains with DP higher than 14 (DP > 14) and a concomitant decrease in the short chains (DP 612). For the sbeI mutant lines, we observed a slight increase in the ratio of amylopectin short chains (DP 612) followed by a decrease in the longer chains (DP > 14), when compared with the wild type control (Figure 5). The decrease of short chains was pronounced in sbeIIb mutant lines (>3% for DP 9), whereas the increase reached up to 1% for DP 18 (Figure 5B).. . FIGURE 4. .

(B) Differences were calculated by subtracting chain-length distributions of isoamylase-debranched wild type from sbeI and sbeIIb mutant lines, respectively.. . . . . . Physicochemical and Nutritional Properties of Starch. The changes of starch granule morphology and fine structure of amylopectin resulted in the alternations of physicochemical and nutritional properties of starch. In comparison with the wild type control, the polished grains of sbeI and sbeIIb mutant lines showed a significantly decrease in hardness, gumminess, and chewiness with more pronounced effects observed in the sbeIIb mutant lines (Table 3). Furthermore, the flours from sbeIIb mutant lines failed to paste at the temperature profile set for RVA analysis, and demonstrated significant decreased values of several viscosity parameters such as the peak viscosity (PV), hot viscosity (HV), breakdown value (BDV, PV-HV), final viscosity (FV) and setback value (SBV, FV-HV). Whereas those values of the sbeI mutants were similar to those of wild type with only a slight decrease of PV (Figure 6 and Table 3). We further analyzed the thermal properties of starch from both sbeI and sbeIIb mutant lines by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The peak temperature indicates the transition induced by melting amylopectin crystallities, whereas the end temperature represents the transition of the dissociation of the amylose-lipid complex (Regina et al., 2010). As indicated in Table 3, the onset, peak and end gelatinization temperatures, and gelatinization enthalpy of thermo-gelatinization for the starch of sbeIIb mutant rice lines were significantly increased compared to those of the wild type (Students t-test, P < 0.01). In contrast, the sbeI mutant starches had similar gelatinization temperatures and decreased gelatinization enthalpy of thermo-gelatinization compared to those of the wild type (Students t-test, P < 0.01) (Table 3). These results indicated that the flours of the sbeIIb mutant rice lines possessed a stronger resistance to alkaline gelatinization and swelling of its granules.. . FIGURE 6. . Rapid viscosity profiles of rice flours from different sbe mutant lines. Pasting curves of the flours from sbeI and sbeIIb mutant lines were measured by a rapid visco analyser (RVA). PV, peak viscosity; HV, hot viscosity; FV, final viscosity.. . . . The in vitro RS content of freshly cooked sbeIIb mutant grains reached as high as 9.8% when measured following the protocol described by the AOAC Method 2002.02 (McCleary et al., 2002), which is significantly higher than that of wild type and sbeI mutant lines in which little or no RS was detected in the grains (Figure 7A). Furthermore, the content of reducing sugar, which is positively and linearly correlated to GI, was much lower in the grains of sbeIIb mutant lines, while no obvious difference was detected between the sbeI mutant lines and wild type (Figure 7B). At the same time, the content of pentosans, which are perceived as one of the major components of healthy dietary fiber, was also significantly higher in the grains of sbeIIb mutant lines compared to wild type, whereas no obvious difference was observed between sbeI mutant lines and wild type (Table 3).. . FIGURE 7. . Contents of resistant starch and reducing sugar in the grains from different sbe mutant lines. (A) RS content of grains of mutant lines and wild type. (B) Content of reducing sugar after a-amylase treatment (Students t-test, n = 3, P < 0.01).. . . . . . . Discussion. In this study, we successfully generated high amylose rice by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis in SBEIIb. We designed gRNAs specifically targeting SBEI and SBEIIb in rice and obtained transgene-free homozygous sbeIIb mutants with a significantly increased AC and RS contents (Figure 7). Compared to conventional breeding, chemical or physical radiation induced mutagenesis and transgene-based strategies, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology can modify a target gene more precisely in a very convenient way (Jones, 2015). No need for laborious crossing and backcrossing and clean plants without transgene could be obtained in one or two generations. Thus, by using a japonica rice variety Kitaake as an example, we here further demonstrated the advantages of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in crop improvement and presented a better alternative strategy to breed for high amylose rice to meet increasing demand of people who suffer from diet-related non-infectious chronic diseases.. Reduction of SBEs activities led to decreased ratio of branch points in the amylopectin fraction and increased AC (Morell et al., 2004). Another effect is on the frequency or distribution of branches (Thompson, 2000; Yao et al., 2004). Whereas SBEIIa and SBEIIb usually generate short chains, SBEI has an apparent function in the formation of long chains of amylopectin (Nishi et al., 2001; Nakamura, 2002; Satoh et al., 2003). Different SBEs play different roles in starch biosynthesis in different plant species. No apparent functionof SBEI was foundin starch metabolism in Arabidopsis (Dumez et al., 2006) and abolishing SBEI activity resulted in no measurable impact on starch structure or functionality in potato, maize, and wheat (Safford et al., 1998; Blauth et al., 2002; Regina et al., 2004). In contrast, a significant increase of AC content was achieved through down-regulation or elimination of SBEII expression in different crop species. For example, down-regulation of SBEII in potato leads to an increase in amylose to approximately 35% (Jobling et al., 1999), whereas potato starch with an AC of 70% or higher was yielded by co-suppression of SBEI and SBEII (Schwall et al., 2000). In barley, suppression of both SBEIIa and SBEIIb generated starch with AC higher than 70% (Regina et al., 2010). In barley, starch granules containing almost entirely amylose were obtained by suppression of all the SBE genes (Carciofi et al., 2012). In maize endosperm, the amylose extender (ae) phenotype with ACs ranged from 50 to 80% were obtained by lesions in the SBEIIb gene (Garwood et al., 1976), whereas lesions in SBEIIa had no effect on endosperm starch (Blauth et al., 2001). In wheat, suppression of the expression of SBEIIa yielded a >70% AC (Regina et al., 2006). In rice, down-regulation of SBEIIb resulted in increased AC up to 2530% in a japonica background (Mizuno et al., 1993; Nishi et al., 2001). Artificial microRNA and hairpin RNA-mediated RNAi silencing of SBEIIb expression in rice grains resulted in apparently elevated levels of amylose and RS and thus lower GI values (Butardo et al., 2011). Inhibition of SBEI led to unaltered AC. In contrast, the SBEIIb RNAi transgenic rice grains showed a substantial increase in AC. However, the increase of AC was much more significant in both SBEI and SBEIIb antisense RNAs transgenic grains, indicating that simultaneous manipulation of SBEI and SBEIIb genes has the potential to dramatically increase the AC in rice grains (Zhu et al., 2012). Our results are consistent with previous studies. Knock-out of SBEIIb leads to the increase of AC and longer amylopectin chains (Figures 4, 5). In contrast, sbe1 mutant lines and wild type were very similar in terms of AC content (Figure 4) (Mizuno et al., 1993; Nishi et al., 2001; Butardo et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012). The sbeIIb mutant lines contained more long chains than wild type, with increased proportion of the long chains (DP > 14) and a concomitant decrease in the ratio of short chains (DP 612) amylopectin (Figure 5). This is in good agreement with an increased proportion of intermediate chains observed in either sbeIIb mutant generated by chemical or physical mutagenesis or sbeIIb RNAi lines (Mizuno et al., 1993; Nishi et al., 2001; Satoh et al., 2003; Butardo et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012). As for sbeI mutant lines, a slight increase in the ratio of amylopectin short chains (DP 612) accompanied by a decrease in the long chains (DP > 14) was observed (Figure 5), consistent with findings from the previous sbe1 rice mutant, which was generated through chemical mutagen, and had an altered fine structure of amylopectin caused by a significant decrease in chains of DP 12 to 21, and an increase in DP < 12 (Satoh et al., 2003). However, our results further indicated that rice SBEI plays a different role compared to SBEI genes in potato, maize, and wheat, in which the inactivation of SBEI resulted in no major impact on amylopectin structure and starch properties (Safford et al., 1998; Blauth et al., 2002; Regina et al., 2004).. It has been demonstrated that the higher proportion of long chains of amylopectin in starch granules led to resistance to gelatinization (Bhattacharyya et al., 1990; Mizuno et al., 1993; Stinard et al., 1993; Safford et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1998; Jane et al., 1999; Nishi et al., 2001). Our results showed that the onset, peak, and end temperature of thermo-gelatinization of the endosperm starches of sbeIIb mutants were significantly increased compared to those of wild type (Table 3). In contrast, the endosperm starches from the sbeI mutants had similar onset, peak, and end temperatures with those of wild type (Table 3), indicating that not only the increased of AC led to the suppression of hydration and swelling of starch, but also the modification of amylopectin fine structure affects physicochemical properties of starch. Furthermore, compared with wild type, an apparent increased RS was observed in the sbeIIb mutant lines (Figure 7). Moreover, the sbeIIb mutant lines also had an increased content of pentosan and decreased level of reducing sugar in comparison to wild type (Table 3 and Figure 7), as observed in SBEIIb RNAi lines in rice (Butardo et al., 2011). Interestingly, slight differences existed in the RVA profiles between sbeIIb-c1 and those of the rest sbeIIb lines (Figure 6), and RS contents between sbeIIb-c3 and the rest of sbeIIb mutant lines (Figure 7), as observed in the fragrant rice generated by TALEN technology (Shan et al., 2015). The reason for this remains unclear; however, it implies that it is important to screen the mutant lines with the highest RS content and lowest reducing sugar content in a breeding program. Finally, it is worth to note that although the altered the fine structure of amylopectin and slight decreased resistance to thermo-gelatinization were observed in our sbeI mutant lines and in a previous sbeI mutant (Satoh et al., 2003), the proportion of RS and level of reducing sugar remained at levels similar to those of wild type (Table 3 and Figure 7). These results suggest that except for amylose, longer and intermediate chain amylopectin molecules may also have an effect on property of the starch molecules, especially the elevations in the ratio of intermediate chains (DP > 14) are associated with increased level of RS in rice (Butardo et al., 2011).. Taken together, we here not only demonstrated the feasibility to create transgene-free high amylose rice plants through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of SBEIIb, but also further defined that SBEIIb plays a more important role than SBEI in determining the fine structure of amylopectin and nutritional properties of starch in rice grain, and thus could be employed as a primary target gene for generating high-amylose rice to meet the increasing demand from people affected by diet-related non-infectious chronic diseases.. . .

PMC5368935	Background. Plummeting cost of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) allowed population geneticists to analyse hundreds of individuals on the whole genome level (e.g. [13]). Moreover, the researchers are no longer limited to the model species as draft genome sequences can be assembled de novo from HTS data (e.g. [4, 5]). The quality of these draft genomes is generally lower than that of the traditionally sequenced genomes [6] but they are still considered adequate for various types of analysis in population genetics as well as genome-wide association studies.. The core algorithm of a modern genome assembler usually implements either a de Bruijn graph [7] or a string graph [8]. Both approaches involve constructing a graph based on sequence overlaps and finding the optimal path through the graph. Such path would correspond to a contiguous assembled sequence known as contig. In a string graph, vertices are represented by reads while a sufficiently long overlap between two reads forms an edge. To construct a de Bruijn graph, each read is split into all possible sequences of length k (k-mers). The k-mers form vertices of the graph while overlaps between k-mers that are k1 bases long become edges. Among the assemblers that implement the string graph approach are SGA [9] and SAGE [10] while de Bruijn graphs are incorporated into ABySS [11], Meraculous [12], ALLPATHS-LG [13], and SOAPdenovo2 [14] among many others.. Pipeline for genome assembly normally includes a rigorous error correction of the reads, which can be done either before the assembly with another tool or during the assembly by the assembler itself. Contig assembly may be followed by scaffolding whereby mate-pair reads that map to two different contigs are used to splice these contigs together into a scaffold. Finally, some pipelines for genome assembly involve merging of the overlapping paired-end reads into longer sequences before the construction of de Bruijn graphs. In fact, ALLPATHS-LG requires that sufficient number of overlapping paired-end reads are present in the input data [13]. Such approach allows the selection of longer k-mer size for the de Bruijn graph construction, which in turn improves the assembly of repetitive regions [14].. Here, we report a stark pattern that appears when calling variants against assemblies generated from de Bruijn or string graphs. If paired-end reads are aligned to the assembled contigs, an unexpectedly high number of variants will be called at a certain position from the end of a contig or scaffold. Depending on the assemblers implementation, this position matches either the k-mer length used for de Bruijn graph construction or the length of reads used in string overlap graphs. Our analyses suggests that the bias is caused by repeated sequences that cannot be successfully resolved by assemblers. While scaffolding mitigates the bias, it does not remove the bias completely and variants are still more likely to appear at the same relative position within contigs incorporated into scaffolds. The most effective approach to attenuate the bias is to remove all variants present in repetitive elements. Since the bias-causing variants are mostly false positives, the bias may have serious implications on downstream analyses performed in resequencing projects [15, 16].. . . Methods. . Whole genome assemblies. A subset of Maylandia zebra (fish) and Boa constrictor (snake) whole genome assemblies (before and after scaffolding) submitted by various teams (Table 1) as entries to the Assemblathon 2 competition [17] were downloaded from the official repository. To reduce the extent of post-processing that could potentially obscure the problem, only the teams representing the original assembler developers were chosen. Since the competitive SOAPdenovo2 assembly of the snake genome was generated using mislabelled mate-pair libraries, we downloaded the corrected version that the team made available after the competition (See Additional file 3 in Bradnam et al. [17])..

In addition, we simulated reads from A. thaliana chromosomes 1 and 2 (Sim) and constructed several assemblies with varying parameters. For SGA, we varied the minimum string overlap (-m 75 and -m 77 for sga_m75 and sga_m77 respectively). For SOAPdenovo2, we set the -K parameter to 69 and 71, which corresponded to k = 70 and 72 for soap_K69 and soap_K71 respectively. Pos column shows the position (counted from ends of contigs or scaffolds) where variants occur most frequently. NA in the k column indicates that the choice of k was not reported and could not be determined from other sources. *The Bcon assembly by the SOAPdenovo2 team submitted for the competition was assembled using an incorrectly labelled library. We analysed the corrected version that was constructed after the competition [17]. . For the alignment against these assemblies, we randomly selected a 400 bp insert library for B. constrictor (ERR234373) and 180 bp insert library for M. zebra (SRR077290). Each library was aligned only against the assemblies of its respective species. Both libraries were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive.. . . Simulated data set. Sequences for chromosomes 1 and 2 of Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR10) were downloaded from The Arabidopsis Information Resource website [18].. To simulate the reads we used SimSeq application that aims to reproduce the biases present in normal Illumina data sets [19]. We ran the application with default parameters to simulate 15 mln 100 bp paired-end reads with the mean insert size of 180 bp and 5 mln 100 bp mate-pair reads with the mean insert size of 3 kb. Since the combined size of the chosen chromosomes is about 50 Mb, the simulated libraries yielded 60 and 20 coverage respectively.. We assembled the short reads from these libraries using ALLPATHS-LG v52293 [13] with default parameters. Henceforth, we will refer to this assembly as Sim_allp where Sim indicates simulated libraries and allp denotes the assembler. We also constructed two assemblies (Sim_soap_K69 and Sim_soap_K71) with SOAPdenovo2 v2.04 [14] specifying different k-mer lengths. The optimal length (K=69) was determined by running KmerGenie [20] for the range of lengths between 39 and 99 with the step of 2. Another length value (K=71) was selected as the next best length according to the KmerGenie output. In both cases, we ran SOAPdenovo-127mer with the options to resolve repeats (-R) and to drop low-frequency k-mers (-d 1). Finally, we constructed two assemblies (Sim_sga_m75 and Sim_sga_m77) using a string overlap assembler, SGA v0.10.14 [9]. For both SGA assemblies, we ran error correction with k-mer length set to 41 (-k 41) and the minimum overlap of 55 (-m 55) for the overlap command. The minimum overlap in the assemble command was set to either 75 or 77 (-m 75 or -m 77). Subsequent scaffolding was performed using default parameters as described in the SGA documentation.. To investigate variant calling for resequencing analysis, we downloaded a short-insert library (SRX144851) of A. thaliana Bs-1 genotype from DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The reads were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2000 and have the insert size of 202 bp with 101 bp read length [21].. . . Variant calling. Variants were called with GATK v3.4-0 [22] following the established best practices [23, 24]. Briefly, the corresponding short insert library was aligned against the assembled sequences using BWA v0.7.12 [25]. After marking the duplicates, the reads were locally realigned around insertions/deletions (indels) and variants were called with HaplotypeCaller. The obtained raw calls were filtered using the criteria recommended for cases when variant calibration was not possible (Table 2).. Table 2SNP statistics reported by GATK and thresholds used for filteringAbbreviationRelThresholdFull nameQD<2.0Quality by DepthMQ<40.0Root mean square of Mapping QualityMQRankSum<12.5Mapping Quality Rank Sum testFS>60.0Fishers exact test for Strand biasSOR>4.0Strand bias Odds RatioReadPosRankSum<8.0Read Position Rank Sum testDP>200.0Depth of CoverageGQ<20.0Genotype QualitySNPs with statistics above or below (Rel) the corresponding threshold were removed from consideration. For detailed description of these statistics and justification for the threshold selection, see Van der Auwera et al. [24] and GATK documentation at https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/. . . To make sure that variants in the regions with excessively high coverage do not affect the results, we separately applied more restrictive coverage filters to the variants called in the fish and snake genomes. The thresholds were set to the expected coverage calculated using the Lander-Waterman equation C=L. N/G [26], where C is the expected coverage, L is the read length, N is the number of reads, and G is the estimated haploid genome length. Based on the reported genome lengths of 1.6 and 1 Gb [17], the expected coverage was 5  and 8  for the snake and fish genomes respectively.. . . Alternative read alignment and variant calling tools. To exclude the possibility that the bias was caused by the tools we used for read alignment and variant calling (BWA and GATK), we also analysed the variants detected against simulated contig assemblies with alternative tools. We ran GATK on the alignments produced by each NextGenMap [27], GSNAP [28], and Bowtie2 [29]. We accepted the default parameters for each of these read alignment applications. Since we suspected that Bowtie2 might have lower sensitivity than the other aligners, we also ran Bowtie2 with the default parameters to align Bs-1 reads against the simulated contig assemblies.. We relied on BWA alignments to test the FreeBayes [30] and Samtools mpileup [31] variant callers. We ran the multithreaded version of FreeBayes and specified the same maximum coverage threshold (200) as with GATK. Following the recommendations from the FreeBayes documentation, variant calls were subsequently filtered using a minimum quality threshold (QUAL < 20). We also used the default parameters for Samtools mpileup except for the maximum indel coverage, which we set to 200. The resultant data was processed with bcftools [31] to produce a VCF file and filter out the variants with low quality (QUAL < 20) and abnormally high coverage (DP > 200).. . . Scaffold position transformation (coordinate mapping). To transform variant scaffold positions to contig positions in ALLPATHS-LG assemblies, we employed the information from the final.summary file that ALLPATHS-LG generates by default. For each scaffold, the file reports scaffold length, list of included contigs with their respective lengths, and gap sizes. Overlapping contigs have negative gap sizes. We noticed that occasionally a scaffold in the final assembly extends beyond the length specified in the summary file. In such cases, we reported the SNPs located beyond the reported scaffold length as untransformed because their coordinates could not be mapped to any contigs.. For the transformation of scaffold positions in SOAPdenovo2 assemblies, we parsed the file with the contigPosInscaff extension. The file is automatically generated by SOAPdenovo2 during scaffolding. For each scaffold, the file lists one or more contig entries. Each entry specifies contig id, starting position within scaffold (origin 0), contig orientation, and ending position within scaffold. We also used the contig length information from the file with contig extension because SOAPdenovo2 often inserted gaps between overlapping contigs in a scaffold. Such a gap would effectively split one of the contigs into two parts making it impossible to derive a transformation map exclusively from the contigPosInscaff file.. Our scaffold coordinate transformation would produce two contig coordinates if a variant is located in a scaffold region where two contigs overlap. We chose this approach because such scaffold variants in principle should have two corresponding contig variants, one on each of the overlapping contigs.. . . Identification and filtering of repetitive elements. We identified repetitive elements and low complexity sequences in the simulated assemblies using RepeatMasker v4.0.5 [32] with the library version 20140131 [33], NCBI search engine, and viridiplantae species filter. To calculate the number of position k SNPs appearing in repetitive elements, we checked the SNP coordinates against the repetitive sequence ranges reported by RepeatMasker. If a repetitive element spanned position k at both ends of a contig and contained two position k SNPs (one at each end), we counted it as a single occurrence, i.e. for each repetitive element sequence the count was either 0 or 1. To adjust for family frequency, we divided the number of position k SNPs appearing within that family by the total number of the family sequences present in the assembly. SNP filtering process entailed the removal of all variants located within any of the identified repetitive elements or low complexity sequences.. . . . Results. . Positional bias in variant distribution within contigs. In our analysis, we used the publicly available data from the Assemblathon 2 competition [17]. For each of the two analysed species, we randomly selected a single short-insert library among those provided to the teams for assembly and aligned the reads against each of the chosen contig assemblies submitted for the competition. In each case, both the aligned reads and the assembly came from the same individual (species). Hence, any variant calls would be false positives and the distribution of their positions within contigs should be approximately uniform.. After calling the variants, we calculated how frequently they appeared at each position counted from both ends of contigs (Table 1). Frequencies were estimated separately for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels). All of the tested assemblies showed positional bias in the distribution of variant calls (Fig. 1; Additional file 1: Figures S1S3). For some assemblies the bias was evident in the distribution of both SNPs and indels while others exhibited only SNP distribution bias. Since indels are typically less frequent, more difficult to call and, therefore, less reliable than SNPs, we will focus on the SNP distribution bias.. Fig. 1Distribution of SNP positions at the 5 end of contigs. The analysis includes a subset of five B. constrictor and three M. zebra assemblies submitted to Assemblathon 2 [17]. The description of assembly identifiers is given in Table 1. . . In addition to the Assemblathon 2 entries, we simulated 180 bp paired-end library and 3 kb mate-pair library using chromosomes 1 and 2 of Arabidopsis thaliana. We assembled the simulated paired-end library into contigs separately with several assemblers. We called variants and analysed the results using the same approach as with Assemblathon 2 data. The simulated data set provided several advantages. First, it excluded the possibility that aligning additional paired-end libraries used for assembly would affect variant calling. Assemblathon 2 teams had access to several paired-end libraries while we only aligned a single one to call variants against those assemblies. The simulated data set contained only a single short-insert paired-end library, which was subsequently aligned to the de novo assemblies. Second, we knew the exact origin of each simulated read, which helped us explain why some variants were called. Third, available HTS data for a different A. thaliana genotype enabled us to explore the effects on variant calling for resequencing analysis. Finally, we were able to run more analyses because of the smaller data set size.. In the literature describing de Bruijn graph approaches to assembly, k-mer length may refer to either the length of sequences at graph vertices [11, 34] or the length of sequence overlaps at graph edges [9, 14]. To avoid the confusion, we will use the first definition and denote such length as k. The length of sequence overlaps at graph edges will be denoted as K, i.e. K=k1 for de Bruijn graphs.. Only three teams (ABySS, ALLPATHS-LG, and SOAPdenovo2) reported k-mer lengths used for assembly (See Additional file 3 in Bradnam et al. [17]). In all cases, the position where SNPs occurred most frequently matched the reported k-mer length (Table 1). This was independent of the tool and the actual k value used in the assembly (ABySS and SOAPdenovo2 teams each specified different k values for their respective B. constrictor and M. zebra assemblies). When assembling our simulated paired-end reads with SOAPdenovo2, we changed the K configuration parameter from -K 69 to -K 71 and the most frequent SNP position shifted from 70 to 72 (Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Figure S4).. Fig. 2Distribution of SNP positions at the 5 end of contigs in the simulated data set. The description of assembly identifiers is given in Table 1. . . Among the assemblers we analysed, SGA [9] was based on string graphs rather than de Bruijn graphs. In this assembler, the parameter equivalent to the k-mer length would be the string overlap length used for graph construction. It can be specified as -m parameter for the assemble command. Changing this parameter did not cause a shift in the peak position (Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Figure S4). Instead, the peak position was linked to read lengths. For the Assemblathon 2 entry and the simulated data sets, the read lengths were 121 and 100 bp respectively. Both values matched the most frequent SNP position of their respective assembly (Table 1). Hereafter, we will use the read length to establish the k position in SGA assemblies.. To make sure that the positional bias is not limited to the very short contigs with potentially poor quality, we removed all contigs shorter than 500 bp and repeated the analysis. The bias was still clearly visible in all cases (Additional file 1: Figures S5S6) indicating that such filtering is not effective for bias reduction.. To remove the variants called in the regions with abnormally high coverage, we used the 200  threshold (DP in Table 2). The value was higher than the expected coverage calculated with Lander-Waterman equation [26]. However, the bias was still apparent even among the variants with coverage that did not exceed the expected levels (Additional file 1: Figures S7S8).. We also compared the distributions of various quality statistics reported by GATK (Table 2) for SNPs at position k to those reported for SNPs at other positions, and found them very similar (Additional file 1: Figures S9S16). While the differences might be statistically significant due to large sample size, the effect size is minimal and considerable overlap between distributions makes SNP discrimination unfeasible. The only statistic that could be possibly used to reduce the bias without substantial effect on other SNPs is mapping quality (MQ). Even then, the results would be largely dependent on the assembler choice and the underlying data set. In particular, the distribution of MQ for SNPs in non- k positions had fairly long left tails in M. zebra (especially Mzeb_allp_6C; Additional file 1: Figure S10) while the MQ distributions for k and non- k SNPs in the simulated data set were hardly separable regardless of the assembler (Additional file 1: Figure S17).. . . Scaffolding does not eliminate the positional bias. Assembly pipelines generally include a step to concatenate contigs into longer scaffold sequences based on mate-pair read alignments. We discovered that the positional bias was attenuated but still persisted in the B. constrictor and M. zebra assemblies after scaffolding (Table 3; Additional file 1: Figures S18S19). The only assembly where the bias appeared less evident was Mzeb_allp_6C but even there the peaks at the position k were notably high. Similar results, including the greatest reduction of the bias appearance in the ALLPATHS-LG assembly, were observed with the simulated data set (Table 3; Additional file 1: Figures S20S21). Removal of the short scaffolds (less than 500 bp) from the B. constrictor and M. zebra assemblies did not completely eliminate the bias either (Additional file 1: Figures S22S23)..

Contig and Scaffold columns show the number of SNPs at position k in the respective contig and scaffold assemblies. Transf column shows the number of SNPs at position k called against scaffolds after the scaffold coordinates were transformed to contig coordinates. Only Sim_allp and Sim_soap_K69 scaffold coordinates were transformed. Untransf column indicates the number of SNPs that failed to transform because of contig length threshold (Sim_soap_K69) or scaffold being extended beyond the length specified in the assemblers scaffold map (Sim_allp). Shared column reports the number of SNPs present in both Contig and Tranformed sets. Masked column shows the SNPs that appear in Contig and Transformed but not in Scaffold because of the change in their relative positions. All counts except Untransf are for SNPs in position k. . . There are two mechanisms that may cause the bias reduction after scaffolding. First, many contigs will be placed in the middle of scaffolds. Thus, many SNPs that were previously present near contig ends would appear in the middle of scaffold sequences as well. Consequently, some SNPs that contributed to the bias before would emerge as SNPs that do not cause the bias because they would not be in position k relative to scaffold ends. This mechanism makes the bias less apparent but it does not actually decrease it because corresponding SNPs still persist in the scaffold assembly (hereafter, we will refer to this phenomenon as bias masking). The second mechanism is triggered by alterations in read alignments. Scaffolding typically involves concatenation of overlapping contigs and gap filling between adjacent contigs. Both actions may alter read alignments in the affected regions. In particular, reads that previously caused SNP calls on individual contigs would not align sufficiently well to the same contigs or would align better elsewhere after scaffolding. Thus, the number of SNPs in both k and non- k positions may diminish. Such bias reduction would be real because it effectively eliminates the bias causing SNPs.. We can measure the effects of these two mechanisms by analysing the intersection between SNPs called before and after scaffolding. To compute the intersection, we have to transform SNP scaffold coordinates into contig coordinates using a scaffold map reported by the assembler. Bias masking occurs when a scaffold SNP from a non- k position appears in the position k after transformation and there is a contig SNP at the same position. Genuine bias reduction takes place when a contig SNP in position k does not have a corresponding scaffold SNP.. We transformed scaffold coordinates into contig coordinates in two assemblies constructed from the simulated reads. In the Sim_allp assembly, scaffolding reduced the number of SNPs in position k from 57 to 7 (Table 3). After transforming scaffold coordinates to contig coordinates, the position bias was clearly visible (Additional file 1: Figures S24S25) as the number of scaffold SNPs in position k increased to 21 (Table 3). Out of those, 18 were also called against the contig assembly (shared SNPs; panel Both in Additional file 1: Figure S26) while 3 were unique to the scaffold assembly (panel Scaffold Only in Additional file 1: Figure S26; Additional file 1: Figure S27). Coordinates for one SNP could not be transformed because the scaffold was longer than specified in the assemblers scaffold map. Out of the 57 contig SNPs present in position k, 12 (21%) emerged in the scaffold assembly at non- k positions relative to scaffold ends (Masked column in Table 3) while 39 (68%) SNPs completely disappeared due to altered read alignments.. In the Sim_soap_K69 assembly, scaffolding also reduced the number of position k SNPs (Table 3; Additional file 1: Figures S28S29) but the underlying processes were different. A large number of SNP coordinates (451 at position k) were not transformed (Untransf column in Table 3) because they corresponded to locations on contigs shorter than 200 bp. Those contigs were excluded from the Sim_soap_K69 contig assembly for SNP calling while the assembler still used them for scaffolding. Therefore, the untransformed scaffold SNPs could not overlap with the contig SNPs in principle and we ignored them when calculating the overlap between contig and transformed scaffold SNPs (Additional file 1: Figures S28S29). We also noticed that SOAPdenovo2 tends to introduce gaps within overlapping contigs. A gap is placed between the end of one contig and the non-overlapping part of the other contig, which breaks the second contig into two non-contiguous parts. This leads to considerable changes in read alignments and consequently yields many SNPs unique to the contig assembly (Table 3; Additional file 1: Figures S28S29). These two reasons also explain the large difference between the number of contig and coordinate-transformed scaffold SNPs (transf column) but much smaller difference between contig and scaffold SNP counts (Table 3). It also explains why the bias masking level is so low; only 44 (3%) scaffold SNPs in non- k positions could be matched to contig SNPs in position k.. . . Positional bias with alternative tools. To make sure that the positional bias was not caused by one of the selected tools (BWA and GATK), we executed variant calling pipelines with alternative read alignment or variant discovery applications on the simulated contig assemblies. Running GATK with either NextGenMap [27] or GSNAP [28] still resulted in clearly visible peaks at the expected locations (Additional file 1: Figures S30S33). When using GATK with Bowtie2 [29], the peaks were much smaller in SGA and SOAPdenovo2 assemblies and the bias was completely absent in the ALLPATHS-LG assembly (Additional file 1: Figures S34S35). However, the number of variants at other positions was much smaller as well.. Previous reports indicated that Bowtie2 was less sensitive to sequence mismatches [35, 36] and may have higher error rates [37]. To check the sensitivity of Bowtie2 on our simulated data set, we ran the Bowtie2  GATK pipeline using resequencing data (see the next section for additional results). Compared to the BWA  GATK pipeline, we saw a considerable reduction in the total number of variant calls (Table 4; Additional file 1: Figures S36S37). This is in contrast to Cornish and Guda [38] who reported only a minor decrease in SNPs between similar pipelines. These results should be interpreted with caution as we do not know the actual number of errors in each case..

Variants detected by each FreeBayes [30] and Samtools mpileup [31] using BWA alignments also exhibited strong positional bias (Additional file 1: Figures S38S41). Since Samtools skips anomalous read pairs and orphan reads by default, filtering out improperly-paired reads would not remove the positional bias.. . . Positional bias is present in resequencing analysis. In the previous subsections, reads used for variant calling came from the same individual as the reads used for the reference genome assembly. Therefore, any called variants would be considered false positives. In this subsection, we investigate the alignment of reads from a different individual to the reference genome. In this case, some of the called variants should be real but there could also be false positives that would potentially manifest themselves as the positional bias described in this study. This analysis imitates the practical use of draft de novo assemblies in resequencing projects that focus on non-model species.. To verify that the positional bias would still be present in variant calling performed with reads from a different individual, we aligned a short-insert library of A. thaliana Bs-1 genotype [21] against our assemblies constructed from the simulated read data. The bias was present in all contig assemblies (Additional file 1: Figures S42S43). It was also clearly visible in both Sim_sga and both Sim_soap scaffold assemblies at the expected locations (Additional file 1: Figures S44S45). Meanwhile, the bias essentially disappeared in the Sim_allp scaffold assembly, probably because of the assemblys high quality (Additional file 1: Figures S44S45). As before, we transformed scaffold positions into contig positions for all scaffold SNPs and observed partial recovery of the bias in Sim_allp (Table 3; Additional file 1: Figures S46S47). We traced a large number of SNPs on Sim_soap_K69 scaffolds to contigs shorter than 200 bp (Untransf column in Table 3). We also found that 15 and 95 SNPs (23 and 5%) from non- k positions in Sim_allp and Sim_soap_K69 scaffolds respectively corresponded to position k SNPs in the contig assemblies (bias masking). These results are consistent with those uncovered through the alignment of our simulated reads.. We tested whether the variant positions in the Bs-1 alignments overlapped with the variant positions in the simulated read alignments. If they overlap well, removing these positions may provide a useful solution for the bias reduction. Despite the partial overlap (Additional file 1: Figures S48S49; Both row in Additional file 1: Figures S50S51), Sim_allp and Sim_soap_K69 data sets possessed abnormally high number of position k SNPs that were unique to the Bs-1 alignments (Bs-1 row in Additional file 1: Figures S50S51). These SNPs comprise the variants that would remain after the filtering of the shared SNPs. The remaining bias was particularly strong in case of Sim_soap_K69. Similar pattern appeared when positions of scaffold SNPs were transformed into contig coordinates (Additional file 1: Figures S52S55). Even though the filtering essentially eliminated the bias from the 5 end of the Sim_allp assembly (Bs-1 row in Additional file 1: Figure S54), the results were not universal and other solutions would be needed.. . . Considerable reduction in bias achieved by repetitive element filtering. For each assembly created from the simulated read data, we traced the origins of all reads that had primary alignments to SNPs at position k with the mapping quality of at least 40 and without any insertions or deletions compared to the reference (CIGAR = 100M). Such conservative filtering ensured that the analysed reads aligned well only to a single location in the assembly and the alignments were not coerced by read clipping. If all such reads had a single origin per variant, it would suggest that the corresponding variants were caused by either simulated sequencing errors or poorly aligned reads from remote genomic regions with modest similarity. If the reads had multiple origins, the variants were likely caused by highly similar repeated or homologous sequences in the genome.. Fewer than 6% of the SNPs had the selected reads coming from the same origin. It suggests that the bias is not caused by poor alignments or sequencing errors but rather by repetitive or homologous sequences. Such sequences would lead to multiple potential path extensions through de Bruijn or string graphs. The extensions would also have equally high support and may form either a junction or a so-called bubble in the path [11]. Further investigation is needed to determine why the assemblers tend to terminate the path extension shortly after a bubble or a junction is formed.. We used RepeatMasker [32] to identify repetitive elements in the assemblies constructed from the simulated reads and discovered that the vast majority of SNPs near contig or scaffold ends were within those sequences (Fig. 3; Additional file 1: Figures S56S66). The pattern persisted whether the SNPs were called against contigs (Additional file 1: Figures S56S57) or scaffolds (Additional file 1: Figures S58S61) and whether the SNPs were called from the alignment of our simulated reads (Additional file 1: Figures S56S61) or from the alignment of the actual Bs-1 reads (Fig. 3; Additional file 1: Figures S62S66).. Fig. 3Distribution of SNP positions at the 5 end of contigs in the Bs-1 data set with repetitive element annotation. Colour indicates whether the SNPs are within repetitive sequences (blue) or not (orange). SNPs were called from the Bs-1 read alignments. Repetitive elements included all sequences reported by RepeatMasker. . In the simulated contig data set, position k SNPs appeared within diverse repetitive elements. The largest number of SNPs were in the DNA and long terminal repeat (LTR) families (Additional file 1: Figure S67), which had the highest representation in the A. thaliana genome [39]. When adjusted for family frequency, SNPs were more likely to appear in the satellites (ALLPATHS and SOAPdenovo2 assemblies) or DNA repeats (SGA assemblies). However, none of the families were strongly overrepresented.. When the SNPs located in repetitive elements were filtered out from the set obtained through the alignment of the simulated reads, the positional bias was either completely eliminated as in the case of Sim_allp or reduced to negligible levels as in the case of Sim_soap and Sim_sga assemblies (Additional file 1: Figures S68S73). The remaining bias might be due to unannotated repetitive elements or other homologous sequences. The same tendency was observed with the SNPs called from the alignment of the actual Bs-1 reads (Fig. 4; Additional file 1: Figures S74S78) except that more SNPs remained overall. This is expected because the alignment of the simulated reads can only produce false positives while the alignment of Bs-1 reads should additionally yield real SNPs.. Fig. 4Distribution of SNP positions at the 5 end of contigs in the Bs-1 data set after repetitive element filtering. SNPs were called from the Bs-1 read alignments and SNPs located in the annotated repetitive elements were removed. . Finally, we checked whether it would be possible to reduce the bias even further by removing both SNPs in repetitive elements and SNPs produced with the simulated read alignments from the Bs-1 SNP set. Since the bias after the repetitive element filtering was already absent in Sim_allp and barely detectable in Sim_sga assemblies, we only report the results for Sim_soap_K69. After transforming scaffold coordinates to contig coordinates, there were 25 SNPs called at position k from Bs-1 read alignments. Out of them, 6 SNPs were also produced by the simulated read alignments (Additional file 1: Figure S79). Overall effect of the additional filtering is fairly minor (row Both in Additional file 1: Figure S80) but the bias almost entirely disappears (row Bs-1 Only in Additional file 1: Figure S80).. . . . Discussion. Resequencing projects rely on a wide range of complex applications that often need to be tuned for the best performance. To achieve high quality results, it is essential to know limitations and biases inherent to each employed application. We have shown that variants obtained from the alignment of short reads against assemblies constructed with de Bruijn or string graphs suffer from positional bias. While the degree of bias varied depending on the input data and setup, it was clearly visible in most tested configurations that encompassed several popular aligners and assemblers. If not addressed, the bias may trigger confounding effects in downstream analyses.. To confirm the bias, we designed two types of analyses. First, we called variants after aligning the reads from a short-insert library that was previously used to construct the reference assembly. In this case, all variants would be false positives. However, they would also be likely to appear when aligning reads from a different individual as long as the corresponding regions are conserved. This type of analyses was performed on both publicly available assemblies and our assemblies constructed from simulated reads. Second, we performed variant analyses with actual reads coming from a genotype different from the reference. In this case, the variants would contain a mix of true positives and false positives. Due to the limited availability of data, we only performed these analyses with the assemblies constructed from the simulated reads.. Our results suggest that the positional bias was caused by the alignment of reads from repetitive or homologous sequences that often had fewer copies included in the assembly compared to the actual genome. The most effective method to reduce the bias is to remove the variants located in repeated sequences. Such variants are very likely to be false positives even when they are not located at position k. Depending on the assembler configuration and input data, such filtering may either eliminate the bias completely or reduce it to almost negligible level. The remaining bias-causing SNPs probably reside in unannotated repetitive elements or other homologous sequences that have multiple copies in the genome but only a single copy in the assembly. While some of the variants could have been caused by heterozygosity in B. constrictor and M. zebra genomes, the simulated data set essentially represented a haploid individual without any heterozygous regions. Therefore, heterozygosity is unlikely to constitute a major factor in positional bias.. We also observed the positional bias while using alternative variant callers (FreeBayes and Samtools) and read aligners (NextGenMap and GSNAP). The only exception was Bowtie2 whose read alignments yielded very weak bias in the SGA and SOAPdenovo2 assemblies and no bias in the ALLPATHS-LG assembly when calling variants with GATK. However, the alignment of the resequencing data with Bowtie2 against the simulated contig assemblies generated considerably fewer SNPs in all positions compared to BWA (Table 4) suggesting decreased sensitivity of the aligner.. Previous reports also showed the reduced sensitivity of Bowtie2 [35, 36] while others revealed only minor [38] or inconclusive [40] differences between Bowtie2 and BWA. Interestingly, Li attributes the differences between variants called from BWA and Bowtie2 alignments to lower mapping scores that Bowtie2 assigns to reads with additional suboptimal alignments [36]. Since similar repetitive sequences are likely to appear multiple times in the assembly, the respective primary alignments would have very low scores and they would rarely produce variants. On the other hand, such drastic reduction in the number of SNPs between BWA and Bowtie2 alignments is unlikely to stem exclusively from the false positives called by BWA. Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether Bowtie2 actually outperforms BWA in terms of both sensitivity and specificity when calling variants against draft genome assemblies.. Theoretically, it may be beneficial for resequencing projects to align reads previously used to construct the reference assembly, call variants and exclude them from the variants called in resequenced individuals. If the involved regions are completely conserved between the reference individual and a resequenced individual, those SNPs would be called for the resequenced individual as well and they would be false positives. However, this type of filtering produced very minor effects on the positional bias in the data sets we analysed, especially after the removal of SNPs located in repetitive elements.. The extent of positional bias obviously depends on the quality of the reference genome assembly. High quality assemblies have reduced number of contigs or scaffolds. Thus, they will have fewer locations to call the bias-causing SNPs. For many projects dealing with non-model organisms, it may not be realistic to construct genome assemblies with adequate quality in sufficiently short time. Moreover, even when a high quality assembly does not readily exhibit a strong positional bias, it may still appear after mapping scaffold coordinates to contig coordinates. We found the evidence for such bias masking in our analyses. Increased number of repetitive elements in a genome would also yield higher positional bias while lowering assembly quality. Therefore, regardless of the assembly quality it would be important to filter SNPs that appear in repetitive elements in order to avoid potential complications.. A more conservative approach would involve filtering out all variants near contig ends. When using a sufficiently large threshold (greater than read length), this would remove the positional bias completely. However, any true variants in those regions will also be lost. To apply such a filter, it would be necessary to know contig coordinates within scaffolds and this information may not be readily available. In any case, this kind of filtering should be done in addition to the filtering of variants in repetitive elements because some repetitive sequences would not be located near contig ends.. . . Conclusions. This study describes positional bias in variant calls that are made against draft genomes constructed with several popular assemblers. The variant calls that cause the bias are mostly false positives that arise from aligning the reads originated in spatially remote repeated sequences or homologous regions. The degree of the bias depends on the choice of tools, configuration, and underlying data set. However, the bias is likely to affect many projects that rely on de novo draft assemblies generated from short read data. The bias can be mitigated by removing variants located in repetitive elements that can be identified by programs such as RepeatMasker [32]. More conservatively, the bias can also be removed by filtering out all variants located near contig ends. Our findings will help researchers who work on resequencing projects to recognise and reduce the position bias, which will result in higher quality variant data sets..
PMC5357057	Introduction. Superinfection exclusion (SIE) refers to the ability of a pre-existing virus (the primary invader) to exclude secondary infections by the same or closely related viruses (superinfectors) at cellular and/or organismal levels. SIE has been observed with many human and animal pathogenic viruses, including the reverse-transcribing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), positive sense (+) RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and West Nile virus (WNV), as well as negative sense (-) RNA viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [15]. More recent studies reported examples of SIE occurring during infections of large, double-stranded DNA viruses including herpesviruses and poxviruses [6, 7]. In all these examples SIE exerted by primary invaders acted in single cells to prevent the multiplication of highly homologous superinfectors in the same cells.. SIE has also been documented for many plant viruses including citrus tristeza virus (CTV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) [8, 9]. Studies using mutants of CTV, plum pox virus, soilborne wheat mosaic virus, and apple latent spherical virus that were labelled with different fluorescent proteins, established that co-introduced variants of the same virus occupy adjacent, yet non-overlapping cell clusters in the same leaves or tissue niches [1013]. These studies clearly demonstrated that SIE among closely related plant virus variants likewise exclude each other at the cellular level, thus drawing strong parallels between SIEs occurring in plant and animal virus infections.. SIE may also be mechanistically related to the well-documented cross protection phenomenon observed in virus-infected plants [1416]. Cross protection refers to the protection gained by plants against a more damaging virus variant, through pre-inoculating these plants with a mild variant of the same virus. Although cross protection has been adopted for plant virus disease management for at least 50 years [15], exactly how the protection is achieved remains to be satisfactorily explained. In theory the cellular level SIE could account for at least some aspects of cross protection, as the plant-wide spread of the pre-inoculated variants could block the cells already occupied by these variants from being invaded by the more severe strains [17]. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to suggest that additional mechanisms might act at the organismal level to augment cross protection [10].. This widespread functional conservation of the cellular level SIE suggests that, once better understood, it could become a promising target for antiviral therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms of SIE remain little elucidated for most viruses. While for some viruses interference with entry of the superinfector appears to be critical [18], for most others the essential inhibitory step is clearly post-entry [2, 3, 19]. A striking feature of SIE shared by the viruses examined so far is its dependence on one or a few virus-encoded proteins and relatively little involvement of host cell components, highlighting SIE as a primarily virus-driven phenomenon [6, 20].. We report here the characterization of molecular mechanism of SIE in turnip crinkle virus (TCV) infected cells. TCV is a small icosahedral plant virus with a (+)-strand RNA genome that encodes five proteins. The 5 proximal p28 and its C-terminally extended derivativep88are both required for viral genome replication (Fig 1A). The two small proteins encoded in the middle of the TCV genome, p8 and p9, are translated from a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA1) and function as cell-to-cell movement proteins (MPs; Fig 1A). Finally, the 3 proximal p38 is translated from a second sgRNA (sgRNA2) and serves both as the capsid protein (CP) and the TCV-encoded suppressor of RNA silencing (Fig 1A).. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006253.g001. Fig 1. . Two TCV-derived replicons exclude each other at the cellular level.. See S1 Fig for additional information. (A) Schematic depiction of TCV genome structure. Note that the three 3 proximal open reading frames (ORFs) encoding p8, p9, and p38 are translated from two subgenomic (sg) RNAs (sgRNA1 and 2). (B) Diagrams of TCV and CarMV replicon constructs expressing GFP and mCherry, used experiments depicted in (C) and (D). (C) Mutual exclusion occurs between TCV_sg2G and TCV_sg2R but not between TCV_sg2G and CarMV_sg2R. Note that a p19-expressing construct was included in this and subsequent experiments to protect the transcribed RNAs from RNA silencing-mediated degradation. (D) Sequential delivery (16-hour interval) allows primary replicons to exclude the superinfecting ones in most cells. See S1D Fig for additional controls. Numbers under the panels represent the percentages of cells fluorescing GFP (G), mCherry (R), or both (G+R) averaged from estimates of at least four different viewing fields. The ranges are standard deviations (SD).. . . . TCV p28 is known to play an indispensable role in viral RNA replication, presumably by rearranging mitochondrial outer membrane into partially enclosed viral replication complexes (VRCs) that house itself, p88, viral RNA, as well as cellular factors required for optimal genome amplification [2124]. In the current study, we uncover a novel role of p28 by showing that it exclusively determines SIE among TCV variants. Strikingly, it does so by forming multimeric intracellular inclusions that inactivate p28 translated from superinfectors, thereby denying superinfectors the chance to replicate. This novel, simple mechanism of SIE could prove to be applicable to many other viruses, and predicts a novel target for antiviral therapy.. . . Results. . TCV replicons expressing different fluorescent markers display mutual SIE. To adopt TCV as a model for investigating SIE, we first tagged TCV replicons with two different fluorescent proteins (Fig 1B). Previous studies showed that deletions within the CP coding region of TCV, while compromising viral cell-to-cell and systemic movement, did not affect its replication in single cells [25, 26]. We hence created two TCV replicons, TCV_sg2G and TCV_sg2R, by replacing the 5 two thirds of the CP coding region with that of GFP and mCherry (Fig 1B). The replicon cDNAs were flanked by the duplicated 35S promoter and terminator (2X35S and T35S) of cauliflower mosaic virus, and inserted into a binary plasmid destined for Agrobacterium tumefaciens (pPZP212) [27]. The resulting recombinant plasmids were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain C58C1 in order to initiate TCV replication in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells via agro-infiltration. Note that expression of GFP and mCherry proteins from these constructs strictly depends on TCV replication, as the sgRNA2 transcript is only produced during replication (hence the _sg2 designation in the names of replicon constructs). A carnation mottle virus (CarMV)-derived replicon named as CarMV_sg2R was used as a non-TCV control (Fig 1B), as CarMV and TCV share similar genome organizations yet limited pair-wise sequence identities of encoded proteins (approximately 50%) [28]. Finally, a construct that facilitates non-replicative expression of p19, the tomato bushy stunt virus-encoded suppressor of RNA silencing, was included to counteract RNA silencing-mediated degradation of the primary, 2X35S-driven replicon RNAs [27, 28].. N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with the replicon constructs were then inspected by confocal fluorescence microscopy at four days post infiltration (4 dpi). As shown in Fig 1C, leaf patches co-infiltrated with the two TCV replicons (left panels) contained cells that expressed either GFP or mCherry, but were completely devoid of cells that expressed both. Indeed, among thousands of cells inspected in multiple repeat experiments, less than 0.1% of the fluorescent cells fluoresced both green and red. In contrast, approximately 80% of the fluorescent cells observed following co-infiltration of TCV_sg2G and CarMV_sg2R expressed both GFP and mCherry (Fig 1C, right panels). These data illustrate that (i) agro-infiltration efficiently and simultaneously introduced multiple viral constructs into the same leaf cells; and (ii) intracellular, mutual exclusion occurred readily between variants of the same virus (TCV), but not between two distantly related viruses (TCV and CarMV).. Was the mutual exclusion between two TCV replicons caused by SIE, which by definition depends on a temporal lag between the entry of primary invader and superinfector? We speculated that co-introduced replicons might experience varying lengths of post-entry delays before they could initiate replication, thus allowing the ones that replicate first to exert SIE against others in the same cells. To test this idea, we compared the timing of fluorescence emergence in cells treated with 2X35S-GFP, a construct that expresses GFP independent of virus replication, and MP_sg2R, a TCV replicon that expresses mCherry only when viral replication occurs (S1 Fig, panel A in Supporting Information). MP_sg2R differs from TCV_sg2R by harboring a 92 nucleotide (nt) deletion within the MP region, thus restricting its replication to primary infected cells (S1 Fig, panel A). As shown in S1B Fig, replication-independent GFP fluorescence emerged in a few cells at 24 hours post infiltration (hpi), but quickly filled more than 70% of cells by 36 hpi. By contrast, replication-dependent mCherry expression first occurred in a few isolated cells at 48 hpi (white arrow in top right panel), and expanded only gradually thereafter, so that approximately 10%, 23%, and 33% of the cells became red fluorescent at 72, 96, and 120 hpi, respectively (S1 Fig, panel B). To summarize, replication-independent expression of GFP occurred early and synchronously in most cells, whereas replication-dependent expression of mCherry was seriously delayed, and then commenced stochastically in a limited number of cells, over an extended time span.. These observations were confirmed with Western blotting (WB) of leaves treated with the GFP and MP_sg2R constructs separately, using an antibody that reacts with both fluorescent proteins (S1 Fig, panel C). Together these results indicate that replication initiation by a TCV replicon in host cells is delayed relative to replication-independent expression, and the length of delay varied dramatically from cell to cell. While the reason for delays will become evident later in this report, their varying lengths likely permitted one of the co-introduced replicons to commence replication earlier than others in the same cell, thus creating the time lag required for SIE.. We sought to further confirm SIE as the underlying reason for the mutual exclusion using a sequential delivery procedure. As shown in Fig 1D, pre-introduction of either TCV_sg2G or TCV_sg2R dramatically reduced the number of cells that replicated the reciprocal superinfector delivered with a 16-hour delay. As demonstrated in S1 Fig, panel D, delayed introduction did not in itself reduce the chance to initiate replication by replicons, as both replicons introduced with a 16-hour delay relative to the p19 construct initiated replication in a similar number of non-overlapping cells. Together, we conclude that SIE likely accounts for the inability of simultaneously introduced TCV_sg2G and TCV_sg2R to co-replicate in the same cells (Fig 1C).. . . TCV p28 alone is responsible for SIE against a co-delivered TCV replicon. We next assessed whether any of the TCV-encoded proteins could induce SIE by transiently expressing each of the TCV-encoded proteins, along with the TCV_sg2G replicon, in N. benthamiana cells. TCV p38 (CP) was not included in this set of testing as constructs without CP (TCV_sg2G and TCV_sg2R) still displayed SIE (Fig 1). To facilitate the verification of their expression, these TCV-encoded proteins were all fused to a C-terminal 2XHA tag, permitting WB detection with an anti-HA antibody (S2 Fig, panel A). Expression of p8-HA or p9-HA did not affect TCV_sg2G replication, as evidenced by robust GFP fluorescence in whole leaves (Fig 2A). In contrast, expression of p28-HA eliminated GFP fluorescence. We further established that p28-mediated repression of TCV_sg2G replication depended on the p28 protein, because a frame-shift mutation of p28 (p28fs) abolished repression. Importantly, the repression of TCV_sg2G by p28-HA was highly specific as p27 of CarMV (CarMV-p27HA) was ineffective. Interestingly, p88-HA partially repressed TCV_sg2G accumulation, presumably attributable to its N-terminal region identical to p28 (Fig 1A). We confirmed these results with Northern blots (NB) and WB (Fig 2B). Both TCV_sg2G RNA and GFP protein accumulated to high levels in leaves co-infiltrated with p8-HA, p9-HA, p28fs, or CarMV-p27HA constructs (lanes 58), but to much lower levels in leaves expressing p88-HA (lane 4), and were almost undetectable in samples expressing p28-HA (lane 3). Together these data indicate that p28-HA suffices for highly specific, potent repression of TCV replication.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006253.g002. Fig 2. . TCV-encoded p28 alone is sufficient to cause the repression of co-introduced TCV replicons.. See S2 Fig for additional information. (A) Transiently expressed p28 protein exerts a potent repression on co-introduced TCV_sg2G replicon. Agro-infiltrated leaves were photographed under UV illumination to visualize GFP fluorescence. Names of various constructs tested are shown on respectively panels. Note that all transiently expressed proteins except p19 contain a C-terminal double HA tag. (B) Verification of results in (A) with Northern and Western blottings (NB and WB). EB: ethidium bromide staining of the RNA gel; Coomassie: Coomassie blue staining of the protein gel. (C) p88MP_sg2R, a TCV replicon encoding p28 as the sole viral protein, once replicationally rescued by another replicon (MP_sg2G), in turn represses the replication of the latter. Cells were stained with DAPI to show nuclei as well as cell boundaries. Only merged images were shown. See S2B Fig for single channel images of the bottom right panel.. . . . To further test if p28 produced during TCV replication likewise represses the replication of a co-delivered replicon, we generated p88MP_sg2R, a derivative of MP_sg2R that contained a 4-nt deletion in the p88 ORF (Fig 2C). As a result, this defective replicon encodes p28 as the sole TCV protein, whose replication function was previously shown to depend on its expression in cis [22]. Functional p88 protein must then be supplied through the co-delivered MP_sg2G (Fig 2C). We wish to emphasize that this latter replicon can replicate by itself as it encodes both wild-type p28 and p88. Also keep in mind that the MP deletion in both constructs restricts them to single cells, thus successful complementation must depend on the co-entry of both constructs into the same cells. As expected, cells infiltrated with p88MP_sg2R alone did not express mCherry, confirming its inability to replicate (Fig 2C, bottom left). Conversely, cells infiltrated with MP_sg2G alone expressed only GFP (Fig 2C, middle panel). However, when the two constructs were co-infiltrated into the same cells, approximately 10% of fluorescent cells expressed mCherry, indicating that in these cells the replication of p88MP_sg2R was successfully rescued in trans by the p88 protein translated from MP_sg2G transcripts (Fig 2C, bottom right; see S2 Fig, panel B for images of individual channels). Strikingly, these mCherry-expressing cells always lacked GFP fluorescence, indicating that the replication of MP_sg2G was abolished in these cells (S2 Fig, panel B). This result was consistently observed in multiple repeat experiments, and indicates that p88MP_sg2R, once becoming replicationally active, turned around to block the replication of MP_sg2G in the same cells, even though it must rely on the p88 provided by the latter for replication. Together these data reveal two vital insights into TCV SIE: (i) p28 acts both as a replication facilitator for p88MP_sg2R itself, and as a repressor in trans for MP_sg2G in the same cell, (ii) p28-mediated repression likely involves a post-translational interaction with p28/p88 encoded by a different RNA.. . . p28-GFP fusion protein forms large, mobile, intracellular inclusions that correlate with repression of TCV replication. To understand how p28 represses TCV replication, we next examined its subcellular localization by expressing it as a fusion protein with GFP attached to its C-terminus (p28-GFP). As shown in S3 Fig (GFP panel), most of the transiently expressed p28-GFP within each cell coalesced into large (510 m in diameter), intensely fluorescent foci. Interestingly, these foci did not co-localize with endoplasmic reticulum (ER, visualized with ER-mCherry; mCherry and Merge panels), or nuclei, or cell wall (both visualized with DAPI; DAPI and Merge panels. Note the white arrows). Since TCV replication was shown to alter the structure of mitochondria (MT) [21, 23], we further evaluated whether p28-GFP foci co-localized with MT using an MT-mCherry marker. As shown in Fig 3A, MT-mCherry appeared as tiny, elliptical dots (mCherry panel). p28-GFP foci and MT-mCherry dots were occasionally next to each other but rarely overlapped (Merge panel). Therefore, these p28-GFP foci appear to be physically distinct from sites of TCV replication.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006253.g003. Fig 3. . p28-GFP fusion protein form large, mobile intracellular inclusions that are not associated with cell nuclei or mitochondria, and repress the replication of a co-introduced TCV replicon.. Also see S3 Fig for the spatial separation of p28-GFP foci relative from ER. A p19-expressing construct was included in all infiltrations. (A) p28-GFP forms dense foci that rival nuclei (DAPI-stained) in size, and spatially separate from mitochondria and cell nuclei. MT-mCherry: a construct expressing mCherry tagged with an N-terminal mitochondrion-localizing signal. Note that DAPI stains cell nuclei as well as cell wall. (B) Mobility of p28-GFP foci. ER-mCherry: a construct expressing mCherry tagged with an N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum-localizing signal. mCerulean-NLS: a construct expressing mCerulean tagged with a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS). The images additionally contained a bright field layer to help define cell boundaries. The three panels denote the same leaf area photographed at three time points: 0, 1, and 2 minutes. Three lower case letters, a, b, and c, denote three mobile p28-GFP foci, with orange and white arrowheads marking the starting and ending points, respectively. Also see a time lapse movie (S1 Video) in Supporting Information for more details. (C) p28-GFP foci do not occur in the same cells with mCherry expressed from a co-introduced replicon (MP_sg2R). The two constructs were mixed at either 1:1 (left) or 0.1:1 ratios. Only merged images were presented. (D) NB and WB verifications of results in (C). Note in lane 5 that the wild-type p28 translated from the MP_sg2R replicon was readily detectable despite of its inability to replicate.. . . . Intriguingly, many of the p28-GFP foci underwent dynamic changes in their shape, size, and intracellular location. In Fig 3B, we highlight three of such foci, designated a, b, and c, by using orange and white arrowheads to mark their start and ending positions within a two minute timeframe. Focus a overlapped with the nucleus of the resident cell at the beginning but became clearly separated two minutes later. Similarly, focus b migrated approximately 20 m downwards and changed shape along the way. Finally, focus c underwent similarly remarkable shape and size changes, despite of its less dramatic movement. Changes of foci a, b, and c, as well as several smaller p28-GFP foci, are further illustrated in a time lapse movie (S1 Video). Together these data clearly demonstrate that p28-GFP coalesces into highly mobile, dynamic inclusions in the cells of its expression that are likely not part of VRCs.. We next tested whether p28-GFP repressed TCV replication by co-expressing p28-GFP and MP_sg2R. As shown in Fig 3C, left panel, most cells treated with both p28-GFP and MP_sg2R constructs at a 1:1 ratio acquired the large irregular inclusions characteristic of p28-GFP. Only a few cells were observed to express mCherry, and these cells were always devoid of GFP, suggesting that they failed to take in the p28-GFP construct. The number of mCherry-expressing cells could be increased by reducing the p28-GFP to MP_sg2R ratio to 0.1:1 (Fig 3C, right panel), and again the red fluorescent cells were free of GFP. We confirmed these findings with NB of TCV RNA, and WB of p28 protein (Fig 3D). While MP_sg2R gRNA and sgRNAs were detected at similar levels in the absence or presence of unfused GFP (lanes 3 and 4), they became undetectable in the presence of p28-GFP (lane 5). Reducing p28-GFP input to one-tenth of MP_sg2R largely released this repression (lane 6). Since both constructs were restricted to the cells they initially entered, these results strongly suggest that p28-GFP, similar to p28-HA, dominantly repressed MP_sg2R replication in the same cells.. The 2X35S promoter-driven transcription of primary MP_sg2R transcripts occurs independently of viral replication. As a result, some p28 proteins are expected to be translated from these primary transcripts even if replication does not take place. This experimental set-up provided us with the opportunity to test whether p28-GFP exerts its repressive activity by interfering with the translation of p28 from a replicon RNA. As shown in Fig 3D, when subjected to WB with a p28 antibody, leaves treated with either p28-GFP or MP_sg2R alone accumulated p28-GFP and p28, respectively (ca. 55 or 28 kilo-daltons [kDa]) (lanes 2 and 3). Surprisingly however, leaves treated with both of them accumulated both proteins to easily detectable levels (lane 5). The detection of p28 in the co-inoculated leaves is particularly noteworthy because its corresponding MP_sg2R transcript level was at least 10-fold lower than in cells with MP_sg2R alone (compare lanes 3 and 5). Thus, p28-GFP-mediated repression of replication must have occurred at a step downstream of p28 translation. These results are consistent with those of Fig 2C implying normal translation of p88 from the repressed MP_sg2G replicon. Together they indicate that p28-GFP blocked MP_sg2R replication post-translationally, probably by disrupting the replication function of p28 (and p88) translated from MP_sg2R RNA.. . . Untagged, replication-independent p28 exhibits opposite activities depending on the co-introduced replicons. The results presented in previous sections, while consistent with a pivotal role of p28 in SIE induction, also beg the immediate question of whether p28 expressed independently of replication, without any C-terminal tags (i.e. 2XHA or GFP), still represses a TCV replicon. This question needed to be resolved because if it does, it would be puzzling that any of our replicon constructs could initiate TCV replication at all, as their primary transcripts would all be expected to translate p28 as the first protein (e.g. S1 Fig; Fig 3D). On the other hand, if it does not, then neither p28-HA nor p28-GFP would reflect an inherent function of p28, which would in turn contradict the observation that the p28-only defective replicon (p88MP_sg2R; Fig 2C) could repress a different replicon (MP_sg2G; Fig 2C).. To resolve this puzzle, we produced three new constructs: the first would express an untagged p28 in agro-infiltrated cells. The second, G11-p28, should express a p28 variant tagged at the N-terminus with a 25-aa G11 tag derived from the 11th -strand of GFP (Fig 4A). The value of G11 tag will become apparent later (Fig 5). Note that these two constructs express the untagged p28 and G11-p28 proteins independent of TCV replication. Finally, the third construct, [p28fs]_sg2R, harbors a non-replicating TCV mutant that contains a one-nt deletion at position 106, causing p28 (and p88) translation to stop after 14 aa. However, the p88 function of [p28fs]_sg2R was little affected, as the replication of this mutant was restored by providing only the p28 (Fig 4A and 4B). An N-terminally truncated p88 could be produced from [p28fs]_sg2R through translational re-initiation at another AUG codon 36 aa downstream.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006253.g004. Fig 4. . Compared to the N-terminally tagged G11-p28, untagged p28 is less competent at complementing the replication of a p28-defective replicon, but more potent at repressing the replication of another replicon encoding wt p28..

(B) Complementation of [p28fs]_sg2R (top row), and repression of TCV_sg2R, by various p28 derivatives (p28-GFP, untagged p28, and G11-p28).

Within each row, the left four panels represent leaf patches infiltrated with transiently expressed p28 derivatives and replicon constructs simultaneously. By contrast, the right two panels represent leaf patches that were first infiltrated with p28 derivatives, and then with replicons, with a 16 hour delay.

The G11-p28 derivative of p28 does not form intracellular inclusions, but is trans-coalesced by untagged p28 and p28-mCherry.. As in previous experiments, a p19-expressing construct was present in all infiltrations. (A) Diagram of the constructs used. Note that the N-terminal G11 tag of G11-p28 does not fluoresce by itself, but becomes fluorescent in the presence of G1-10 expressed from a separate construct.

See time lapse movies in S2 and S3 Videos for the intracellular migration of the p28 inclusions induced by replicon-borne p28.. . . . Contrary to the prevailing assumption that replication function of p28 is cis-acting [22], the transiently expressed, untagged p28 was able to partially complement the replication of the p28-defective [p28fs]_sg2R. As shown in Fig 4B, [p28fs]_sg2R did not replicate by itself (panel 1; also Fig 4C, lane 2), but replicated in an average of 25% cells in the presence of untagged p28 (panel 3; Fig 4C, lane 4). Notably, no complementation was observed with p28-GFP (Fig 4B, panel 2), suggesting that the C-terminal GFP tag abolished the replication function of p28. Unexpectedly, the N-terminally tagged G11-p28 complemented the p28-defective replicon twice as efficiently as p28 (compare panels 3 and 4 of Fig 4B, and lanes 4 and 5 of Fig 4C), suggesting that the N-terminal G11 tag rendered p28 more replication-active, possibly by overcoming certain repressive state of p28 (see later). Importantly, complementation by untagged p28 weakened only modestly when [p28fs]_sg2R was introduced with a16-hour delay (Fig 4B, panel 5; and Fig 4C, lane 7), suggesting that the replication state of p28, once established, was minimally affected by extended pre-accumulation. By contrast, complementation by G11-p28 actually strengthened when the defective replicon was delayed, further confirming G11-p28 as more replication-active than untagged p28 (compare Fig 4B, panels 4 and 6; Fig 4C, lanes 5 and 8).. However, when co-introduced with the wild-type (wt) p28-encoding TCV_sg2R replicon, transiently expressed p28 turned repressive. As shown in Fig 4B, untagged p28 caused the number of red fluorescent cells to decrease to about 1/4 of the TCV_sg2R only control (compare panels 7 and 9), indicating a partial repression of the replicon by untagged p28. Furthermore, this repression by p28 became more potent when the TCV_sg2R replicon was introduced with a 16-hour delay, reducing the number of cells with replication-dependent mCherry fluorescence to 1/15 of the control (panel 11). Notably, the N-terminally tagged G11-p28 was substantially less repressive than untagged p28 (Fig 4B, panels 10 and 12). This contrasts with the C-terminally tagged p28-GFP that caused a complete loss of TCV_sg2R replication (Fig 4B, panel 8; also Figs 2 and 3), suggesting that these tagged forms of p28 represent two extremes of the repressive activity of wt p28.. These data were further corroborated with NB (Fig 4C). The reduction in TCV_sg2R RNA levels caused by untagged p28 was less dramatic than the numbers of red fluorescent cells, possibly reflecting the limitation of confocal microscopy in detecting cells with very low mCherry expression (Fig 4B and 4C). Together these results strongly suggest that transiently expressed, untagged p28 exists in two different statesone replication-active, the other repressive. Importantly, the replication-active state, once established early on, did not readily transit to the repressive state, as evidenced by the sustained ability of p28 (and G11-p28) to complement sequentially delivered [p28fs]_sg2R (16 hour delay; Fig 4B, panels 3 and 5). Intriguingly, the repressive state of p28 that repressed the co-introduced TCV_sg2R must have established itself fairly early as well. The co-existence of two p28 states with opposite functions in turn suggests that their corresponding protein fractions probably exist in separate cellular compartments.. . . Both transiently expressed and replicon-borne p28 converts the diffuse G11-p28 to punctate inclusions. Results presented above strongly suggest that untagged p28 exists in both replication-active and repressive states. Since the replication-repressing p28-GFP formed large, dynamic, and mobile intracellular inclusions, we next wondered if the repressive state of untagged p28 also existed in similar inclusions. Because untagged p28 does not fluoresce by itself, we first determined whether G11-p28, being replication-competent but repression-deficient, were capable of forming punctate inclusions. Detection of G11-p28 was in turn facilitated by co-expression of G1-10, the first 10 -strands of GFP, which interacts with the G11 tag to generate green fluorescence (Fig 5A) [29, 30]. As shown in Fig 5B, panel 1, GFP fluorescence reconstituted by G11-p28 and G1-10 co-expression showed a clearly diffuse distribution without discrete foci. Since G11-p28 efficiently complemented the replication of a p28-defective mutant (Fig 4), this result suggests that the replication function of p28 does not require the formation of punctate foci.. In contrast, while untagged p28 alone did not cause detectable changes in cell morphology (panel 2, cell boundaries visualized with ER-mCherry), its co-expression with (G11-p28 + G1-10) led to the coalescence of green foci in approximately 70% of fluorescent cells, and a reduction of diffuse GFP in the same cells (Fig 5B, panel 3; note the top, left, and right cells contained green foci but little diffuse green fluorescence, whereas the bottom middle cell contained mostly diffuse green fluorescence). We infer that these intensely fluorescent foci must have arisen from the coalescence of the otherwise diffuse G11-p28, induced by the co-expression of untagged p28. This in turn suggests that untagged p28 could self-associate into punctate inclusions capable of coalescing G11-p28. Consistent with this inference, p28-mCherry, which like p28-GFP formed visible inclusions, coalesced G11-p28 much more efficiently than untagged p28, leading to dominance of mostly yellow foci in co-infiltrated cells, and concomitantly near complete loss of diffuse G11-p28 (Fig 5B, panel 4; note yellow foci). Together these results reveal two important insights: (i) transiently expressed, untagged p28 induced the formation of punctate inclusions in a substantial fraction of cells; and (ii) the p28 (and p28-mCherry) inclusions, once formed, are capable of seeding the coalescence of a non-coalescing p28 mutant (G11-p28).. Notably, complementation of the p28-defective [p28fs]_sg2R by G11-p28 (plus G1-10) was accompanied by diffuse distribution of both GFP and mCherry, resulting in cells that emit diffuse, brown fluorescence (Fig 5B, panel 5). By contrast, co-expression of G11-p28 (plus G1-10) with TCV_sg2R encoding wt p28 led to the appearance of green foci in approximately 50% of cells, indicating that wt p28 expressed from the replicon RNA likewise formed punctate inclusions that seeded G11-p28 coalescence (Fig 5B, panel 6). Strikingly, some of the focus-harboring cells contained little or no red fluorescence, suggesting that in these cells the replication-repressive state of p28 was established very early, thus preventing the initiation of replication by TCV_sg2R. This outcome mirrors the inefficient replication initiation by TCV replicons documented in S1B Fig, suggesting that at least in some cells, p28 translated from replicon transcripts turned repressive before the transcripts had chance to commence replication. Most importantly, similar to p28-GFP inclusions, these replicon-induced inclusions were highly mobile, often racing across the entire cell in less than ten minutes (time lapse S2 and S3 Videos in Supporting Information).. Here we summarize several key observations concerning the role of p28-induced punctate inclusions in SIE. (i) The inclusions are not required for replication function of p28. (ii) Untagged p28, expressed either transiently or replication-dependently, is capable of forming inclusions, though less efficiently than C-terminally tagged p28 derivatives. (iii) Once formed, these inclusions nucleate the otherwise non-aggregating p28 derivatives. (iv) The inclusions are highly mobile, likely enabling them to capture monomeric p28, sequestering them from the alternative functionality of p28 (replication). Together they support the concept that these inclusions correspond to a repressive state of p28, and they exert the repressive function by trapping freshly translated p28 molecules.. . . Replicon-expressed G11-p28 supports replication, but not SIE. Having shown that the replication-competent, yet repression-deficient G11-p28 by itself maintained a diffuse distribution, but was converted to punctate inclusions by p28, we next asked whether G11-p28 expressed from a replicon could support TCV replication and SIE. To address this question, we generated two new replicon constructs (Fig 6A). The first, [G11-p28]_sg2G1-10, fused G11 to the N-terminus of p28, and incorporated G1-10 in the sgRNA2 coding region. Since sgRNA2 can only be synthesized following successful replication, the expression of G1-10 from this replicon, and resulting green fluorescence, will only occur if G11-p28 can function in replication. The second construct, [G11-p28]_sg2R, was identical to the first except that G1-10 was replaced by mCherry (Fig 6A).. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006253.g006. Fig 6. . TCV replicons encoding G11-p28 abolish SIE among themselves, but are dominantly repressed by those expressing wt p28.. (A) Diagrams of three replicon constructs used in the current set of experiments. Note that GFP fluorescence reconstitution by the top construct is dependent on its successful replication, and fluorescence signals co-localize with G11-p28. By contrast, mCherry expressed from the middle construct, while dependent on replication as well, should not associate with G11-p28. (B) Confocal microscopy of the replicon constructs expressed either separately or in combination in N. benthamiana cells. Only merged images were presented. (C) Verification of replication of various TCV replicons with NB.. . . . When introduced individually into cells, the [G11-p28]_sg2G1-10 and [G11-p28]_sg2R replicons each produced fluorescence in approximately 10% of cells (Fig 6B, panel 1 and 2), suggesting that the G11 insertion compromised, but did not abolish, the replicability of the replicons. This was also confirmed with NB (Fig 6C, lanes 1 and 2). As expected, the green fluorescence reconstituted by G11-p28 and G1-10 co-expression was diffusely distributed (Fig 6B, panel 1). To our surprise, co-introducing these two constructs into the same cells led to approximately 50% of fluorescent cells to express both GFP and mCherry, indicating a loss of SIE that allowed the simultaneous replication of both the [G11-p28]_sg2G1-10 and [G11-p28]_sg2R replicons. We conclude that the replicon-borne G11-p28 was incapable of exerting SIE, despite of retaining p28s activity in replication. Hence, the SIE function of p28 in the replicon background was likewise successfully decoupled from its replication function by the N-terminal G11 tag.. . . Replicon-expressed wt p28 exerts SIE to a G11-p28-expressing replicon, and seeds G11-p28 coalescence. Our data thus far revealed that G11-p28 simultaneously weakens p28s propensity to form inclusions and compromise its ability to exert SIE, leading us to hypothesize that the p28 inclusions are directly responsible for SIE. To further test this hypothesis, we asked if untagged, wt p28 expressed from a TCV replicon could exert dominant SIE to another replicon encoding G11-p28. To do so, we further generated the TCV_sg2G1-10 replicon that encoded wt p28 but expressed G1-10 from sgRNA2, which could not fluoresce unless G11-p28 translated from a different construct is present in the same cell (Fig 6A). N. benthamiana leaf cells were then treated with a mixture of TCV_sg2G1-10 and [G11-p28]_sg2R constructs. As expected, most of the fluorescent cells contained green but not red fluorescence (Fig 6B, panel 4), demonstrating preferential replication of TCV_sg2G1-10 encoding wt p28, and simultaneous repression of [G11-p28]_sg2R encoding G11-p28 (which nevertheless could translate G11-p28 independent of replication). Importantly, the green fluorescence existed as dense foci in these cells, confirming the coalescence of G11-p28 through an interaction with wt p28 that exerted SIE to [G11-p28]_sg2R. Although a few isolated cells showed red fluorescence indicative of [G11-p28]_sg2R replication (Fig 6B, panel 4, lower left), these cells never contained any GFP fluorescence, suggesting that they took in only the [G11-p28]_sg2R construct. Together these data further support the idea that a repressive state of p28 exerts SIE by trans-aggregating fresh, diffuse form of p28 translated from superinfecting TCV genomes.. . . . Discussion. SIE acts in the cells already occupied by a virus to deny the chance of secondary infections by the same or closely related viruses, but has no effect on more distantly related viruses. While SIE has been observed in infections of a wide range of viruses with diverse genome structures and host tropisms, its molecular mechanism remain poorly understood. Studies using CTV (different from TCV!) found that SIE can be abolished by replacing three virus-encoded proteins, namely the replication-related L1 and L2 proteases, as well as movement-related p33, with their counterparts from a distantly related CTV strain [8, 31]. Similarly, SIE of WNV and HCV was found to be reversed by mutations in a few viral proteins, among them WNV-encoded 2K and NS4A, and HCV-encoded E1, p7, and NS5A [4, 19]. More recently, Tatineni and French [20] revealed that proteases and capsid proteins encoded by two plant-infecting potyviruses were responsible for SIE of cognate viruses. These studies suggest that SIE is exerted by a relatively few proteins encoded by the primary virus. Mechanistic dissections using several (+) ssRNA animal viruses (WNV, HCV, and BVDV) further suggest that SIE functions primarily by blocking the replication of the superinfector [24, 19]. However, exactly how this blockage is achieved remains a mystery.. . Mechanism of SIE in TCV infections. In the current study, we demonstrate that SIE among TCV variants is adequately explained by the action of p28, one of the TCV-encoded replication proteins, that exists in two distinct functional and structural states in infected cells. Collectively our data support a model through which p28 acts both as a replication facilitator and a repressor, depending on its cellular concentration (Fig 7). First and foremost, we hypothesize that both the replication and SIE functions of p28 derive from its inherent ability to self-interact to form oligomers. These oligomers become seeds onto which additional p28 molecules are coalesced, ultimately leading to structures responsible for replication or SIE. At the very early stage of a TCV invasion when p28 concentration is relatively low, the rate of p28 polymerization is slow, as the polymerization itself necessarily lowers p28 concentration in the cytoplasm. This rate is probably further constrained by various steps of virus replication complex (VRC) formation, including incorporation of p88 and/or viral RNA into p28 polymers, and enclosure of the complex by mitochondrion outer membrane [21, 23] (Fig 7, steps 1 and 2). On the other hand, in cells where a resident TCV is undergoing active replication, the large amounts of progeny TCV genomes template p28 translation to very high levels. This could in turn accelerate the polymerization of p28, leading to the formation of oversized p28 complexes that escape membrane enclosure, permitting easy trapping of freshly translated p28 monomers, including those translated from superinfecting TCV genomes, thus preventing the formation of new VRCs, leading to SIE (Fig 7, steps 3 and 4). Note that the structures of p28 complexes depicted in Fig 7 are hypothetical as we currently do not know their structural details. It is further possible that high levels of p28 might also dilute out the host proteins needed for VRC assembly, thus favoring the coalescence of p28 inclusion bodies.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006253.g007. Fig 7. . A model of TCV p28-mediated SIE.. Step 1: the concentration of p28 translated from the genome of primary invader (top right, black dots) is relatively low. They interact with each other relatively slowly, allowing the incorporation of p88, and enclosure of the complex by mitochondrion outer membrane to form VRCs. Step 2: genomic RNA of the primary invader enters VRCs to initiate replication. We hypothesize that some VRCs stay vacant and await the entry of newly synthesized viral RNA. However, the majority of progeny RNA will probably not have the chance to repeat the replication cycle in the same cell. Also beginning with this step, large amounts of progeny RNA become template for p28 translation, drastically increasing the intracellular concentration of p28. Step 3: higher p28 concentration propels faster p28 polymerization, leading to quick formation of oversized p28 polymers that escape the membrane enclosure. Note that the forms of polymeric p28 complexes are hypothetical as we do not yet know the specific mode of p28-p28 interactions. Step 4: since the p28 polymers are by definition capable of nucleating homologous monomers, they are expected to capture the p28 monomers (blue dots) translated from superinfector genomes, preventing them from forming new VRCs.. . . . Importantly, the formation of large cytoplasmic p28 complexes does not prevent the p28 molecules already sequestered inside VRCs from functioning in viral replication. This arrangement ensures that the primary invader continues to replicate inside VRCs, while superinfectors are subdued by the cytoplasmic p28 complexes. That p28 can exist both in membrane-associated VRCs and repressive cytoplasmic complexes is not unprecedented, as similar partitioning was reported for the tomato mosaic virus (ToMV)-encoded 130K replication protein, which exists in a membrane-associated, replication-competent form, as well as a cytoplasmic form capable of suppressing RNA silencing [3234].. Our model is highly consistent with the observation that the strongly SIE-inducing p28 variants, including p28-GFP/mCherry/HA, form large, dynamic, and mobile cytoplasmic inclusions that trans-aggregate the otherwise diffusely distributed, yet replication-active G11-p28. Furthermore, our experiments indirectly implicated untagged p28, expressed either transiently or during replication, in similar cytoplasmic inclusions. It can be envisioned that the C-terminal tags could enhance the stability of p28 oligomers, thus favoring the formation of oversized polymers, whereas the N-terminal G11 tag could destabilize p28 oligomers, thus slowing down the polymerization.. Our model provides an immediate explanation for the inefficient initiation of replication by agro-delivered replicon constructs (S1B Fig). The strong 2X35S promoter in these constructs drives the transcription of primary TCV RNA to levels that are higher than natural viral invasions (typically a few viral genomes), but lower than progeny genomes produced by active replication. As a result, p28 oligomerization likely takes place at an intermediary rate that blocks most primary TCV transcripts from replication, yet allows occasional escape from this blockage in a stochastic manner (S1B Fig). Our model further asserts that the ones that do evade this blockage would in turn produce vastly more abundant p28, thus solidifying the repression against other co-introduced replicons.. . . Are p28-containing cytoplasmic inclusions VRCs?. Previous studies of other virus models appear to link large cytoplasmic inclusions formed by viral replication proteins with active replication [35, 36]. Based on our results, this view might warrant a second look. Specifically, we show that the N-terminally tagged G11-p28 robustly complemented the replication of a p28-defective replicon, yet did not form large cytoplasmic inclusions, and was incapable of SIE. By contrast, the C-terminally tagged p28-GFP/mCherry and p28-HA were completely inactive at replication, but formed large inclusions and exerted powerful SIE. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic inclusions represent the repressive form of p28, and that replication-active VRCs might be rather orderly structures discernable only with electron microscopy [37]. Presence of viral RNA in the cytoplasmic foci does not necessarily signal active replication, as viral RNA could become trapped in the foci through interactions with p28 and its analogs. Finally, our results also call for caution when interpreting experiments using tagged proteins, as these tags could alter the balance among various functional state(s) of original proteins.. . . SIE as the underlying mechanism for cis-preference of p28. Many virus-encoded replication proteins are cis-acting or at least cis-preferential, meaning they exclusively or preferentially benefit the very viral RNA molecule from which they are translated [22, 3841]. In most (+) ssRNA viruses, the cis-acting protein typically corresponds to the replication protein that is more highly expressed, yet does not possess RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) signature, thus analogous to p28 of TCV. Kawamura-Nagaya and colleagues [40] found that the replication-competent form of TMV p126 bound to TMV genomic RNA co-translationally, thus proposing this p126-RNA binding as the underlying mechanism for p126 cis-preference. However, it is uncertain as to how widely applicable this mechanism is, as it does not explain how the 1a protein encoded by the tripartite brome mosaic virus (BMV), being cis-preferential relative to the 1a-coding RNA1, is nevertheless able to function in trans to facilitate the replication of the other two BMV genome segments (RNA2 and RNA3) [39].. Similar to TMV p126 and BMV 1a, TCV p28 is also known to be cis-preferential [22] (also see Fig 2C). However, our new findings suggest that cis-preference of p28 likely reflects a strong trans-repression rather than cis-action. We show that transiently expressed p28 complemented a mutant replicon incapable of producing its own wt p28. Therefore, p28 cis-preference is readily overcome once the following two conditions are met: (i) p28 is expressed from a non-replicating mRNA; and (ii) the defective replicon does not encode a functional p28. It should be noted that this experimental system differs from that of White and colleagues [22], where the two mutant replicons used, APA and RT, produced either p28 (APA) or p88 (RT), but not both. As a result, the preferential amplification of the p28-encoding APA replicon could be explained by the fact that the p28 produced by a replicating APA could strongly repress the p88-encoding RT, whereas p88 produced by the RT mutant would be only weakly repressive (e.g. Fig 2A). This difference in repressive activity between p28 and p88 could cause p28 to appear to be cis-preferential. While it remains to be determined whether this mechanism applies to cis-acting proteins of other viruses, we note that it allows the replication-active form of p28 (and its analogs in other viruses) to be accessed by non-p28-coding RNAs like satellite RNAs, defective interfering RNAs and, in viruses like BMV, other genome segments. Of course, this model does not rule out the possibility that certain cis-acting RNA elements could function to de-aggregate p28 complexes, thus permitting their re-entry into the replication-competent pool.. . . SIE as the underlying mechanism for viral population bottlenecking at the cellular levels. Multi-variant populations of many plant viruses are known to undergo dramatic bottlenecking during systemic infections [28, 4144]. Recent studies strongly suggest that this population bottlenecking is likely caused by cellular level SIE exerted by viral variants that arrive at certain parts of the plants (e.g. vascular bundles and systemic leaves) ahead of other variants [17]. The SIE mechanism proposed in this study additionally provides an alternative explanation for the intracellular population bottlenecking observed by Miyashita and colleagues [45]. These authors found that individual tobacco cells receiving a viral population comprising thousands of ToMV variants allowed a tiny fraction of the incoming variants (fewer than 10) to replicate. The authors invoked active but stochastic degradation by host cell nucleases as a possible reason of observed population bottlenecking [45]. Based on the SIE mechanism proposed here, we think that it is likely that, as soon as a few variants start to replicate, they would swiftly produce large amounts of replication-repressing viral proteins (or proteins like p28 that exert both replication and repression functions) that actively block the replication of other variants. This model is further consistent with the authors observation that the handful surviving variants in each cell accumulated varying numbers of progenies [45]these variants could have initiated replication at different post-entry time points prior to the full establishment of the repressive state.. . . Adaptive rationale of the proposed SIE mechanism. We noted earlier that SIE was observed in diverse viruses with distinct genome structures and host tropisms, suggesting it as an evolutionarily advantageous trait for viruses. With our current understanding of the TCV system as the basis, we next consider the underlying rationale for the preservation of SIE by viruses. In our model, we hypothesize that p28 translated from the newly replicated TCV genomes mostly serves to reinforce the repressive state of p28. The logical extrapolation of this idea is that these newly replicated TCV RNAs are also targeted by the repressive state of p28. Indeed, we speculate that they are the primary or intended targetthe superinfector genome becomes targeted because it is mistaken as one of the newly synthesized viral RNAs. Why is then a trait that represses the replication of progeny genomes selected for? We reason that such a trait would ensure random mutations accidentally incurred during the viral replication process are isolated in a minimal number of progeny genomes. This is particularly important for RNA viruses as virus-encoded RdRPs are known to be error-prone, estimated to introduce close to one error per genome per replication cycle for TCV-sized genomes [46]. Consequently, allowing progeny genomes to repeat the replication cycle inside the cells of their origin would not only cause the proliferation of these errors, but also exacerbate their potential damages by compounding them with additional errors. By denying the progeny genomes the chance to re-replicate, SIE constitutes a powerful adaptive constraint that maximizes the genome stability of RNA viruses, and possibly also viruses with DNA genomes.. In summary, the current study reveals a novel mechanism of SIE that engages a repressive state of a replication protein to capture its counterparts translated from superinfected (and newly synthesized) viral genomes, thereby preventing the latter from entering replication cycles. While substantial additional research is needed to resolve the detailed structure and functional mode of the repressive form of the protein involved, we are confident that this general mechanistic framework will prove to be applicable to other viruses, possibly leading to the development of novel antiviral strategies that target this mechanism.. . . . Materials and methods. . Constructs. The TCV_sg2G construct was from a previous study (formerly named TCV-GFP) [47, 48]. Briefly, this construct is based on a binary plasmid (pPZP212) that replicates in both E. coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain C58C1). The TCV cDNA, in which the 5 2/3 of the CP coding sequence was replaced by that of GFP, was placed under control of 2X35S to permit the transcription of primary TCV RNA by RNA polymerase II of plant cells. Both TCV_sg2R and CarMV_sg2R were produced in a similar manner. Note that the mCherry coding sequence was modified to eliminate sites of common restriction enzymes while maintaining the amino acid sequence (the modified mCherry sequence, designated mCherry2, is available upon request). MP_sg2G and MP_sg2R were derivatives of TCV_sg2G and TCV_sg2R, respectively, that incorporated a 92-nt deletion within the MP coding region [26, 49]. p8892_sg2R was in turn a derivative of MP_sg2R that contained a 4-nt deletion within the p88 coding region, as a result of digestion with ApaI, followed by blunt-ending and relegation [22].. Replicon constructs containing G11-tagged p28 were generated through a three-step manipulation. First, in order to maximize the number of unique restriction enzyme sites, the 2X35S-TCV_sg2R-T35S cassette was switched to pAI101, a pCambia1300 derivative with a modified multiple cloning site, to create pAI-TCV_sg2R. Next, to produce [G11-p28]_sg2R, a gBlock fragment (IDT, Coralville, IA) consisting of TCV 5 UTR plus the p28 start codon (66 nt), the coding sequence of the 11th -strand of GFP connected to an 8-aa flexible linker (GRDHMVLHEYVNAAGITDGGSGGGS), and the first 63-nt of p28 coding sequence was synthesized, and used to replace the first 129 nt of TCV cDNA (released by XhoI and XmaJI sites) in pAI-TCV_sg2R using Gibson Assembly cloning (NEB, Ipswich, MA). Finally, the [G11-p28]_sg2G1-10 construct was created by replacing the mCherry coding sequence with that of the first 10 GFP -strands (G1-10) [31].. Constructs 2X35S-GFP and 2X35S-p19 were described in an earlier study [27]. Other transient expressing constructs were produced similarly. The ER-targeting signal was derived from mGFP5 [50]. The mitochondrion-targeting signal was derived from the yeast cytochrome c oxidase IV [51].. . . Agro-infiltration. Agro-infiltration experiments were conducted as described in ref [27].. . . Microscopy. Confocal microscopic observations were carried out using a Leica Confocal microscope (TCS SP5) available through Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, The Ohio State University.. . . Quantification of fluorescent cells. The quantitative data in S1B Fig were obtained by counting fluorescent cells in viewing fields containing approximately 50 cells. For each treatment, five such fields were counted and the percentages of cells with GFP or mCherry fluorescence were calculated. The numbers presented were midpoint values with range of variations. For all other figures, the fluorescent cells were quantified as a percentage of the total number of cells in a given viewing field by dividing a minimally magnified (10X) image of the viewing field to 100 (10 X 10) equal-sized mini-squares using the View/Show/Grid option of Photoshop, and counting the number of mini-squares within each image that are at least 50% fluorescent. For each treatment, at least four images were quantified in this manner and the range of variations was provided in the relevant figures.. . . Northern and Western Blotting (NB and WB). NB and WB were carried out as described [27, 47]. A 32P-end labelled oligo complementary to the 3 UTR of TCV was used to detect TCV genomic as well as subgenomic RNAs. A p28 antiserum was used to detect p28 protein in Western blots. A GFP antibody (Life Tech, Carlsbad, CA) was used to detect both GFP and mCherry.. . . . Supporting information. . S1 Fig. .

PMC5338290	Herbivorous insects and their host plants have been engaged in a chemical arms race for more than 420 million years1. Whilst host plants have developed various chemicals for defence against herbivorous insect damage, herbivorous insects have evolved various countermeasures23. Some insects even use plant chemicals for their own benefit4. Most chemical ecology studies have focused on a small number of specific species rather than systematically exploring a wide range of species.. Many herbivorous butterflies feed on specific host plants, thus forming plantherbivore networks. In recent years, large-scale data on ecological networks, including plantherbivore networks, have become available with the development of new observation techniques and with improvements in databases and other infrastructure. Network analysis techniques resulting from the development of network science5 have been used in ecology to actively investigate ecological networks, with respect to both basic scientific research (e.g., structurestability relationships) and applied ecology (e.g., biodiversity maintenance and environmental assessment)678.. Taxonomic families of herbivorous butterflies generally correspond to those of host plants, thus reflecting the close co-evolutionary relationship between butterflies and plants. A correlation has been observed between changes in host plants and species diversification in the butterfly superfamily Papilionidea9. Numerous observations of hostplant selection have established that this selection is controlled by chemical constraints, i.e., several insect species recognise plants by detecting their chemical components10111213141516. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms that determine hostplant shifts are poorly understood16. A general understanding of the molecular factors involved in hostplant selection requires detailed chemical and genomic studies on a wide range of insects and plants.. To address this problem, we integrated biological data to gain a comprehensive picture of the contribution of plant chemical compounds to host plant selection and to identify candidate plant compounds involved in specific interactions between butterfly and plant families. This required us to first comprehensively collect data on plantherbivore relationships involving Japanese butterflies, which were not previously available in the HOSTS lepidopteran host plant database [ http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/hostplants/].. The Japanese Islands lie at the convergence of three terrestrial ecozones, namely, the Palearctic (including Europe, Asia north of the Himalayan foothills, northern Africa, and the northern and central Arabian Peninsula), the Oriental (extending across most of South and Southeast Asia and into southern East Asia), and Oceania. Although the flora and fauna of the Japanese Islands are influenced by all three ecozones, they retain their unique status in these islands, which extend from the subarctic to subtropical zones and include many highlands. These geographic and ecological features, as well as an abundance of accumulated knowledge from observations of area-specific populations of butterflies, are attractive targets for research on species diversification. We have generated a complete plantherbivore network for the Japanese Islands. This network, designated the InsectInDB database (http://insect-plant.org/), comprises 545 insects, 1,922 plants and 3,435 insectplant relationships.. In this study, we used network analysis combined with taxonomic information to clearly demonstrate that butterfly subfamilies in different families feed on the same plant groups, thereby indicating the independent acquisition of the same adaptive phenotypes (i.e., to the same hosts). The incorporation of chemical compound data allowed us to consider the contributions of plant compounds to butterfly hostplant selection by comparing two hypotheses: a feed-on-family hypothesis in which butterflies preferentially feed on host plants in the same family, and a feed-on-compound hypothesis in which butterflies select plants that produce similar compounds. Statistical analysis enabled the identification of compounds specific to host plants of particular butterfly families. We determined that some of these compounds are known to attract limited groups of butterflies and repel others. An integration of the insectcompound relationship data revealed potential metabolic processes related to host-plant selection. Our results successfully demonstrated the value of data integration for the computational detection of candidate host plant selection compounds. Finally, the further integration of genomic and transcriptomic data allowed us to unveil the putative molecular mechanism of host plant selection.. . Results. . Study strategy overview. Before describing the approach used in this study, we first will define the terms used in this paper to describe different plantinsect relationships. Several sets of words, including generalist/specialist and monophagous/oligophagous/polyphagous, have been used to represent the range of insect host preferences17. When discussing plantherbivore relationships, a specialist is an herbivore that has evolved a specific mechanism to feed on a particular host plant, whereas a generalist is one that has not. Monophagous, oligophagous and polyphagous refer to the number of host plants fed on, i.e., only one, a few, or many host plants, respectively. Alternatively, oligophagous is defined as the use of multiple host plant species from the same family18. Generalist/specialist can also refer to the breadth of plant selection by pollinator insects19. In many cases, however, these words are ambiguous. For example, specialist and monophagous typically indicate that an herbivore feeds on a single host plant species, but they are sometimes applied to an herbivore feeding on an entire family. To avoid confusion, we define the number of host plant species and host plant families as mono-species-phagous/oligo-species-phagous/poly-species-phagous and mono-family-phagous/oligo-family-phagous/poly-family-phagous, respectively (Fig. 1a). Similar to oligophagous/polyphagous, the distinction between oligo- (several) and poly- (many) is somewhat subjective. In this paper, we use these words to avoid ambiguity when discussing plantherbivore relationships at the species and family levels.. To achieve a general understanding of host plant selection by Japanese butterflies, we considered plantherbivore relationships (Fig. 1b) and the presence of compounds in various plant species (Fig. 1c) as follows. First, plantherbivore relationships between butterflies and their host plants were represented as a bipartite network (Fig. 1d) in which a node represents a butterfly or plant species and an edge indicates that the butterfly feeds on the host plant. Second, the network was divided into sub-networks according to taxonomic family (Fig. 1e). The combined use of plantherbivore relationship (Fig. 1b) and plantcompound relationship (Fig. 1c) data allowed us to identify compounds common to a group of host plants that are specific to a group of butterflies (in order to distinguish from just common compounds, we refer to this type of compounds as common specific compounds in this paper). For example, suppose that butterflies B4 and B5 feed specifically on plants P3 and P4 (Fig. 1b). Among the compounds shown in Fig. 1c, C1 is common to all plants, which indicates that C1 may be important for plant survival in general but may not be involved in interactions with specific butterflies. Compound C2 is common specific to plants P3 and P4 but not P1 and P2, indicating the possibility that C2 functions to attract butterflies B4 and B5 and repel B1, B2 and B3 (Fig. 1f). When we examined the contributions of these common specific compounds to host plant selection, we found that some were, in fact, important in the plantherbivore relationship. Finally, a comparison of compounds identified as participants in plantherbivore relationships unveiled insect metabolic processes that may be involved in the interaction (Fig. 1g).. . . General architecture of the Japanese butterfly plantherbivore network. Several seminal studies have revealed that taxonomically related host plants are used by particular butterfly families2021. In the present study, we adopted the most recently reported phylogenies of angiosperm plants (APGIII)22 and butterflies23 to examine the relationships between butterflyhost plant associations in the Japanese Islands. To analyse the network architecture as a whole, we conducted a comprehensive literature survey in which 3,435 plantherbivore relationships encompassing 1,922 plant species and all 545 butterfly species living in Japan were examined. All members of the superfamily Rhopalocera except for Riodinidae are found in the Japanese Islands; these butterflies are classified into the families Hesperiidae, Papilionidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae and Nymphalidae. Figure 2a shows the distribution of butterfly families in the Japanese Islands and global ecozones. We conducted a similarity analysis based on Pearsons correlation coefficients (r) of the relative proportions of butterfly families in different ecozones, which indicated that the butterfly composition of the Japanese Islands is similar to those of the Holarctic (r=0.92) and Oriental (r=0.91) ecozones. This result may imply that butterfly distributions in the Japanese Islands are more influenced by distributions in the Holarctic and Oriental ecozones than by those in Oceania or other ecozones, however, it still lacks solid evidence and analysis. The number of butterfly species in Japan (302) is much smaller than the numbers in other ecozones (2,224, 2,411, 1,274, 3,964 and 7,784 in Holarctic, Oriental, Oceania, Afrotropical and Neotropical ecozones, respectively). Another factor that may need to be considered is that Papilionidae butterflies are especially popular in Japan and have been extensively catalogued.. Figure 2b, which shows the relationship between the number of host-plant families and butterfly species, clearly demonstrates that host plant preferences differ among butterfly families. For example, Hesperiidae and Lycaenidae both feed on a wide range of host plant species; however, the butterflies in the first family feed on members of one or two specific host plant families, whereas butterflies in the latter family feed on a wider variety of host plant families. To distinguish between these behaviours, we therefore prefer to use mono-species-phagous/oligo-species-phagous/poly-species-phagous and mono-family-phagous/oligo-family-phagous/poly-family-phagous, as proposed above, rather than the existing terms, specialist/generalist and monophagous/oligophagous/polyphagous. The matrix representation in Fig. 2c clearly reveals some characteristics of the host plant selectivity of Japanese butterflies. For example, the genus Papilio in Papilionidae and the subfamilies Pierinae in Pieridae and Heliconiinae in Nymphalidae are generally mono-family-phagous and have specific relationships with host plants in Rutaceae, Brassicaceae and Violaceae, respectively. In contrast, some butterfly subfamilies in different families exhibit shared host plant selectivity: for example, the subfamily Coliadinae in Pieridae and the subfamily Polyommatinae in Lycaenidae both feed on plants in Fabaceae, whereas the subfamily Hesperiinae in Hesperiidae and the subfamily Satyrinae in Nymphalidae both interact with host plants in Poaceae. Poly-family-phagous butterflies can also be identified from the matrix. For example, butterflies in the subfamily Theclinae in Lycaenidae generally feed on more than three host-plant families.. An examination of the entire network of plantherbivore relationships (Fig. 3) also reveals that butterfly species in the same family tend to share the same host-plant species and families. The Papilionidae, Nymphalidae and Pieridae families have their own predominant sub-networks (upper left, upper middle and upper right in Fig. 3, respectively). Rutaceae and Brassicaceae are examples of plant families predominantly fed on by single butterfly families (Papilionidae and Pieridae, respectively). In contrast, two or more butterfly families (Hesperiidae, Lycaenidae and Nymphalidae) share for the plants of the families Poaceae and Fabaceae.. To further analyse plantherbivore relationships, we simplified the network to describe significant interactions between plant and butterfly families (Fig. 4a) with significance evaluated based on real vs. randomised network Z-scores (see Methods). Positive Z-scores indicated that plants in a particular family are significantly more likely to be eaten by insects from a certain family than by those in the randomised networks. As shown in Fig. 4a, the five butterfly families clearly form selective plantherbivore relationships. For example, Papilionidae butterflies interact specifically with the families Rutaceae, Apiaceae, Aristolochiaceae and Lauraceae, thus forming an isolated network. The remaining four butterfly families also have their own specific host plant families, with two exceptions: Coliadinae subfamily in Pieridae and Polyommatinae subfamily in Lycaenidae butterflies share Fabaceae plants, and Hesperiinae subfamily in Hesperiidae and Satyrinae subfamily in Nymphalidae butterflies share plants in Poaceae. These butterfly subfamilies are in different families. Nonetheless, the families have independently acquired the ability to use the same groups of plants as hosts.. Figure 4b shows significant plantherbivore relationships between plant families and butterfly subfamilies. For example, the two subfamilies of Papilionidae (Parnassiinae and Papilioninae) have significantly different host plant families, and the same is true for the two Pieridae families (Pierinae and Coliadinae). Among the butterfly subfamilies in Lycaenidae, Curetinae and Miletinae have no specific host plant families, Polyommatinae and Theclinae are poly-family-phagous, and Lycaeninae is mono-family-phagous. The subfamily Satyrinae in Nymphalidae and the subfamily Hesperiinae in Hesperiidae might be regarded as generalist taxa because they feed on two or more host plant families. Because their host-plants are mostly restricted to a single order, we instead consider these latter butterflies to be mono-order-phagous.. With respect to butterfly families (Fig. 4a), the plant families Poaceae and Fabaceae are significantly shared by two butterfly families. At the butterfly subfamily level (Fig. 4b), plants in Fabaceae are consumed by the subfamily Coliadinae in Pieridae and by the subfamily Polyommatinae in Lycaenidae. Members of Poaceae serve as host plants for both the subfamily Satyrinae in Nymphalidae and the subfamily Hesperiinae in Hesperiidae. We found that these two plant families differ with respect to the types of butterflies that consume them. In particular, Poaceae is significantly eaten by subfamilies that are mono-order-phagous (Hesperiinae and Satyrinae), whilst Fabaceae is eaten at a significant level by poly-family-phagous subfamilies (Coliadinae, Polyommatinae, Cyrestinae and Limenitidinae).. A negative Z-score indicates that plants belonging to a particular family are significantly less subject to predation by a given insect family compared with those in randomised networks. Thus far, we have shown that Poaceae and Fabaceae are eaten by a wide range of butterflies (Fig. 4a). However, having analyzed the relationships with butterfly subfamilies, we also found that Poaceae and Fabaceae are consumed differently (Fig. 4b). Poaceae members have no significant relationships exhibiting negative Z-scores, indicating that there are no butterfly subfamilies that significantly avoid Poaceae plants. On the other hand, Fabaceae members have some relationships exhibiting negative Z-scores, i.e., significantly less numbers of host-plant relationships with Papilioninae, Theclinae, Nymphalinae and Satyrinae. To explain this difference, we hypothesised the presence/absence of some factors that work as repellent for some butterflies but as attractant for some other butterflies. In other words, Fabaceae plants are eaten by a wide range of butterflies because they possess some factors that exert both significantly positive (i.e., attractive) and negative (i.e., repellent) effects, whereas Poaceae plants are devoured by a wide range of butterflies because they have attraction factors but not repellent factors.. . . Influence of plants on host-plant selection. In the previous section, we demonstrated that host-plant selection is highly associated with butterfly taxonomic classifications and implied the existence of factors influencing host-plant selection. To provide more conclusive evidence for this idea, we explored two possible hypotheses: the feed-on-family hypothesis or the feed-on-compound hypothesis (Fig. 1h). To test the likelihood of the feed-on-family hypothesis, we calculated Z-score statistics based on family-based evenness for butterfly category (family or subfamily) i, Ereal(i), and the evenness of randomised networks, Erand(i) (see Methods). We found that the average Ereal(i) (0.03) was significantly lower than the average Erand(i) (0.16) (Z=61.9; p<2.21016 using the Z-test).. We likewise examined the possibility of the feed-on-compound hypothesis. To determine whether a set of host plants of a butterfly species tended to possess a higher number of common specific compounds compared with those from randomly selected sets, we applied the food-pairing hypothesis24 to our datasets. For the statistical test, we used the average number of compounds shared among host plants by butterfly species k, Ns(k)24. From the original plantherbivore network, we extracted all plantherbivore relationships in which at least one compound was present in the host plant according to the species-metabolite relationship database KNApSAcK [25]. This extracted network, which consists of 216 butterfly and 405 plant species, is subsequently referred to as the real-world network. A comparison of real-world and randomised network Ns(k) values (Nsreal(k) and Nsrand(k), respectively) revealed that the average Nsreal (k) (0.37) was significantly larger than the average Nsrand (k) (0.09) (Z=8.9; p<2.21016 using the Z-test).. We focused on the statistics for each butterfly family for further evaluation. In particular, we used the average family-based evenness for butterfly family i, E(i), and the average number of compounds shared among host plants by butterfly species k, Ns(k). Figure 5a shows the relationship between Z-scores of average plant family-based evenness for butterfly families, ZE(i)=(Ereal(i)  Erand(i))/SDE(i)rand, and the Z-scores of the average number of common specific compounds in host plants, ZNs(k)=(Nsreal(k)  Nsrand(k))/SDNs(k)rand. Ereal(i) [Nsreal(k)] and Erand(i) [Nsrand(k)] correspond to E(i) [Ns(k)] obtained from the real-world network and randomized networks, respectively. SDE(i)rand, and SDNs(k)rand are the standard deviations for Erand(i) and Nsrand(k), respectively (Data and Methods). Figure 5b is the same scatterplot for the butterfly subfamilies. For butterfly families and subfamilies, the Z-scores of evenness were mostly negative, which indicated that the actual host-plant relationship was more selective than random. The Z-scores of Ns were positive for the butterfly families Pieridae, Lycaenidae, and Papilionidae as well as for many subfamilies, which indicated that the host plants possessed more common specific compounds than would be expected by random chance. As clearly shown in Fig. 5a and b, the Z-scores of evenness and those of Ns were negatively correlated, indicating that the common specific compounds positively contributed to host-plant selection. For example, Pieridae and its subfamilies (Pierinae and Coliadinae) are significantly lower in evenness and higher in Ns compared with other families and subfamilies. Together with the previously known phenomenon that many phytophagous insects are highly adapted to defense chemicals produced by plants and use them as the specific host-finding cues1415, the results obtained in this study provide quantitative support for our hypothesis that insects tend to selectively feed on closely-related plants sharing common specific chemical compounds.. We assumed that the global trend of host-plant selectivity was a mixture of different levels of feed-on-compound effects, i.e., some plants express a strong feed-on-compound effect, whereas others do not. Based on this idea, we determined the compound contribution of each plant species i, denoted as i (see Methods). According to our calculations, most plant species had a positive value of i, thus contributing positively to the feed-on-compound effect (Fig. 5c and d).. The relationship between i and degree (i.e., the number of butterflies that predate on the respective plant species) is shown in Fig. 5c. Two Rutaceae species (Zanthoxylum ailanthoides and Phellodendron amurense) exerted particularly high feed-on-compound effects, whilst a species in Poaceae (Oryza sativa) had a negative effect. We found that i was moderately positively correlated with degree (Spearmans rank correlation coefficient rs=0.53, p<2.21016). This correlation indicated that the presence of common specific plant compounds generally attracts phytophagous butterflies, an observation that supports the feed-on-compound hypothesis.. Figure 5d shows the relationship between plant family i and average neighbour degree (i.e., the average number of host-plant families consumed by the butterfly herbivores of the respective plant species). Although the figure indicates that most plant families are eaten by mono-family-phagous butterflies (lower neighbour degree), we also observed that poly-family-phagous butterflies tend to feed on host plants with a lower i. This result reveals the relationship between i and host selectivity.. . . Common specific compounds in host plants. To identify specific compounds shared by host plants of a particular butterfly family, we used Fishers exact test, which, analogous to its application in genome-wide association studies, is the simplest method for inferring associations or correlations. We extracted all plantherbivore relationships involving at least one plant compound registered in KNApSAcK25 from the original plantherbivore network mentioned in the previous section, thereby obtaining 890 plantherbivore relationships encompassing 217 butterfly species, 406 plant species and 3,507 plant compounds. Statistical significance based on Fishers exact test was evaluated using Cramers V; for example, given a sample size of 890 and a Cramers V value of ~0.6, the threshold P-value was set to 1.0106.. Common specific compounds in host plants of Pierinae (family Pieridae), Lycaenidae, and Papilionae (family Papilionidae) butterflies are shown in Fig. 6a,b and c, respectively. Host plants of the Pierinae specifically possess a number of glucosinolates and flavonoids (Fig. 6a), whereas Papilionae (family Papilionidae) and Lycaenidae host plants are characterised by skimmianine and genistein, respectively (Fig. 6b,c). Among these identified compounds, glucosinolates are attractive to certain members of Pierinae but repel other butterflies101126. Some plants, such as members of Brassicaceae, have a glucosinolate-myrosinase chemical defence system (Fig. 7a); to avoid this system, some Pieridae butterflies have a nitrile-specifier protein (NSP) (Fig. 7b)14. In addition, skimmianine (Fig. 6c) has been reported to attract certain Papilionidae butterflies, whereas a study on the interactions between Papilionidae and Rutaceae families27 has revealed that skimmianine has a prohibitive effect on these other butterflies. As clearly shown in the plant-compound matrix in Fig. 6d, plants belonging to the Brassicaceae and Rutaceae families typically possess glucosinolates and skimmianine, respectively. We found that genistein is specific to host plants of Lycaenidae butterflies; however, those plants belong to the family Fabaceae, which hosts a wide variety of Lycaenidae, Nymphalidae and Pieridae butterflies (Fig. 6e). Taking all of these results into consideration, we concluded that the identified common specific compounds contribute to the host-plant selectivity of mono-family-phagous butterflies.. . . Enzyme catalysis in plantherbivore relationships. Because herbivorous butterflies incorporate plant chemicals whilst feeding, an herbivorous butterfly and its host plants can be generally assumed to share more compounds (C1 in Fig. 1g) than other butterflyplant pairs. This assumption is consistent with the results of previous studies. For example, some insects have been found to use plant-derived chemicals as signalling materials or as precursors of chemical messengers (e.g., pheromones)15. In another study, volatile organic compounds produced by insects and plants had an overlap of 87%. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) members share significantly more aromatics than do Hymenoptera (bees and ants), whilst no significant difference in shared monoterpenes has been observed between the two orders28.. In this study, we expanded the above assumption to compounds not shared between butterflies and their host plants (C2, C2, C5 and C6 in Fig. 1g). Even when compounds in a butterfly are not exactly the same as those in host plants, they may be derived from the latter (C2 and C2 in Fig. 1g) via the insects metabolism. To overcome this problem, we used the Pherobase29 and KNApSAcK25 databases to find potential substrateproduct pairs for all possible combinations of compound pairs (see Methods for details)3031.. Our database search revealed four insect compounds that could possibly be such products (right-hand side of Fig. 7dg). The corresponding substrates of all four compounds (Fig. 7dg, left) are present in Brassicaceae plants; of these four compounds, three (Fig. 7d,e and g, left) were found to be Pieridae host-plant specific (Fig. 6a). We used the E-zyme webserver (see Methods) to search for known enzymatic reactions having the same chemical transformation patterns as the query reaction3233. Only one of the four reactions (Fig. 7g) was shown to have the same chemical transformation pattern as the known glucosinolate-myrosinase reaction (Fig. 7a). The remaining three reactions (Fig. 7df) had the same chemical transformation patterns as those of an avoidance reaction (Fig. 7b,c)1126. Among the possible products (Fig. 7dg, right), only allylnitrile (Fig. 7e, right) was found to be possessed by a butterfly species, Pieris brassicae. No butterfly species possessed any other products, according to Pherobase. Although there is no direct evidence, we showed that the integration of plantinsect relationships, plant compounds and insect compounds provides indirect evidences to infer potential enzyme catalysis. If we integrate additional data, i.e., gene or protein sequence information, further analysis would be available.. To cope with glucosinolates, Pieridae family butterflies have developed the NSP protein34. In the presence of NSP, insect myrosinase acts on glucosinolates to produce nitrile compounds (Fig. 7b,c) that are less toxic than the isothiocyanate compounds produced when NSP is absent (Fig. 7a). These two alternative reactions correspond to the reactions predicted in Fig. 7 (i.e., the reactions in Fig. 7df and Fig. 7g correspond to the myrosinase reaction in the presence or absence of NSP, respectively). This NSP protein is not found in any other organisms and is thought to be specific to Pieridae family butterflies.. We therefore searched genome and transcriptome sequences to determine whether myrosinase and NSP genes are present in a wider range of insects. At the time of our survey, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database contained 17 complete and 36 draft genome sequences of insect species, whilst Sequence Read Archive (SRA)35 had genome and transcriptome sequences for 48 and 131 insect species, respectively. Although some protein sequences of Pieridae butterflies have been registered at NCBI, none of their genomes have yet been sequenced. We conducted a comprehensive search for myrosinase and NSP against all published insect genomic and transcriptomic data (see Methods). Myrosinase-like sequences were detected in all sequenced butterflies and moths (Bombyx mori, Chilo suppressalis, Danaus plexippus, Graphium sarpedon, Heliconius melpomene, Manduca sexta, Melitaea cinxia, Papilio glaucus, Papilio machaon, Papilio memnon, Papilio polytes, Papilio xuthus and Plutella xylostella), but no NSP-like sequences were detected. This result is consistent with butterfly host selection of glucosinolate-containing plants11.. . . . Discussion. We have demonstrated that insects selectively feed on closely-related plants containing common specific compounds. Nevertheless, distinguishing between taxonomic and compound effects on plantherbivore interactions (or host-plant selection) is difficult because plants in the same family may share many compounds. To overcome this complication, more careful examinations may be required. In particular, phylogenetic signals must be removed when evaluating the association between chemical compounds and plantherbivore interactions. In this context, though comparative phylogenetic analysis36 is useful, this approach generally considers a simple evolutionary model in which species traits change in a Brownian fashion on a phylogenetic tree with accurate branch lengths. Phylogenetic comparative analysis was not applied in this study for two reasons. First, the phylogenetic tree was not accurate; thus, a phylogenetic comparative analysis may have led to misleading conclusions. Second, our dataset included only a few samples of specific plantherbivore interactions and plantcompound relationships. In comparative phylogenetic analysis, a loss of statistical power is known to occur in small datasets37. Although definite conclusions were not obtained, we expect that the effect of compounds on plantherbivore interactions is dominant1415. In particular, only weak (although significant) phylogenetic signals have been observed in studies of plantpollinator38 and seed-dispersal39 networks.. Our study has shown that the common specific compounds are mostly toxic compounds (Fig. 6), however, such common specific compounds were not found in Poaceae or Fabaceae, either of which is shared by some butterfly subfamilies in different families (Figs 3 and 4). This result may be due to the limited information in the examined databases but may also be explained by another hypothesis: Poaceae and Fabaceae do not possess particularly toxic compounds, and these less toxic plant species may serve as stepping stones during a transition to new host plants, because the butterflies were able to use their existing detoxification mechanisms to adapt to these plants. At least in Papilionidae, the diversification of butterfly species is thought to be correlated with changes in host plants9. Papilio machaon, one of many Papilionidae butterfly species that strongly depend on Rutaceae plants (Fig. 4), is thought to have evolved recently and feeds on a wide range of host plants, including Apiaceae. Rather than expanding to Apiaceae from Rutaceae plants in a single bound, a reasonable hypothesis is that Papilio machaon temporarily adopted less toxic hosts, such as Fabaceae plants, during its evolution.. When investigating host plant selection in this study, we only considered plant compounds; however, many other factors (such as hardness, leaf shape, and especially trichomes) are known to affect host plant edibility. Although these factors are described in field guides, encyclopaedias, and databases, their comprehensive and quantitative acquisition for use in informatics analysis is difficult. Moreover, the effects of phylogenetic signals were not considered in this study despite the importance of phylogenetic comparative analysis40. This is because an accurate phylogenetic tree is still unavailable. However, the absence of this analysis poses little problem because several studies have reported that phylogenetic signals are weak in ecological networks4142. Despite these limitations, we have successfully shown that plant compounds generally contribute to the host-plant selection of phytophagous butterflies. Although molecular phylogeny is a powerful tool for understanding evolution, we strongly maintain that the integration of various types of data currently scattered across published articles and databases would enhance the study of natural evolutionary diversity.. . Concluding remarks. Diversity is one of the most appealing characteristics of insects. Because of this diversity, however, unstructured knowledge is scattered throughout the literature and various databases, hindering comprehensive and systematic analyses. The strength of the current study is the integration of various types of data, including those pertaining to plantherbivore relationships and plantcompound relationships, which enabled us to obtain a list of compounds that putatively contributed to host plant selection. By itself, this approach is insufficient to enable conclusions, but it can provide insights about molecular mechanisms drawn from the relationship data. Further enrichment of these relationship data would enhance and widen the scope of possible analyses, such as the prediction of host plant relationships and the inference of responsible genes or proteins using various machine-learning techniques.. . . . Data and Methods. . Plantherbivore relationships. Although the HOSTS database (http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/hostplants/) maintained by the Natural History Museum in the UK contains information on plantherbivore relationships involving butterflies and their host plants worldwide, it lacks data on some relationships, especially those in the Japanese Islands. We therefore conducted a literature survey to collect plantherbivore relationship information relevant to the Japanese Islands. The data collected and used in this study are summarised in the InsectInDB database (http://insect-plant.org/). The current InsectInDB release (as of January 2016) contains approximately 545 insects, 1,922 edible plants and 3,435 plantherbivore relationships. InsectInDB provides links to plantherbivore relationships and metabolomic and genomic data via the scientific names of insects or plants.. . . Plant-compound and insect-compound relationships. We collected plant compound data (Fig. 1c) using the KNApSAcK database25. We used Pherobase (http://www.pherobase.com), a major online resource cataloguing pheromone compounds that influence the behaviour of insects and other animals29, for the analysis of compounds common to insects and their host plants (Fig. 1g).. . . Interaction frequency between insect and plant families. To evaluate the strength of the interaction between insect family i and plant family j, we computed Wij, the number of interactions between the insects in family i and the plants in family j appearing in the plantherbivore network. We also evaluated the statistical significance of Wij in the observed network using values from randomised networks (see below for details).. . . Randomised networks and significance. A comparison with randomised model networks was performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed network measures24434445. We used the null model 246, which is similar to the fixed row-fixed column null model used by Bascompte et al.47. This null model generates random bipartite networks with degree sequences identical to those of real networks. In the null model, the probability that a plant connects to an animal is proportional to the product of node degrees for a given plant or animal.. The significance of the network measure X was evaluated based on the Z-score: ZX=(Xreal  Xrand)/SDrand, where Xreal is the network measure of a real-world network, Xrand is the average value of the network measure, and SDrand is the standard deviation obtained from 1,000 randomised model networks.. . . Family-based evenness index. To measure the diversity of host plants of a specific insect category, we used a family-based evenness index based on Pielous evenness index48, which is a Shannon diversity index used to evaluate species evenness. In particular, the evenness index of insect category (species, subfamily or family) i was defined as follows:. . . . . . where mf indicates the set of plant families appearing in the plantherbivore network and |mf| is the number of plant families. Si and Nij are the number of plants interacting with insect category i (i.e., node degree of insect category i) and the number of plants in family j connecting to insect category i, respectively.. To characterise the overall trend of the evenness, we also considered the average family-based evenness:, where A and |A| denote the set and number of insect species, respectively.. . . Compound contribution to plantherbivore networks. Drawing on terminology established for flavour networks24, we defined a coefficient of compound contribution, i, to evaluate the contribution of plant i to the feed-on-compound effect in plantherbivore networks as follows:. . . . . . where A and P denote sets of insect and plant species, respectively, A(i) and P(j) are the set of insects feeding on plant i and the set of plant species consumed by insect j, respectively, |X| is the size (number of elements) of set X, Ci is the number of compounds in plant i, fi represents the number of insects feeding on plant i, and S (i) is the average number of plant species that serve as prey in A(i). The first term indicates the average degree of the overlap of compounds between plant i and other plants in A(i) for the observed data. The second term is the expected value of the average degree obtained when assuming no host plant selectivity (i.e., insects feed on randomly selected plants). Thus, a positive or negative i indicates the positive or negative contribution, respectively, of plant i to the feed-on-compound effect.. . . Chemical compound-based reaction prediction. The reaction prediction based on chemical compounds consists of two steps. The first step is the problem of enzymatic reaction-likeness, i.e., whether a pair of metabolic compounds can be the substrate and product of a single enzymatic reaction30. The second step is the prediction of the actual enzymes responsible for the putative enzymatic reactions33. To accomplish the first step, we used known chemical transformation patterns encoded as SMIRKS strings49 to search for pairs of metabolic compounds potentially possessing the same chemical transformation pattern. For the second step, we used the E-zyme32 and E-zyme233 webservers. E-zyme predicts putative enzyme classifications (referred to as Enzyme Commission numbers) with generated values reflecting the similarity between the given transformation patterns and known patterns. E-zyme2 predicts putative enzyme orthologues (i.e., homologous proteins/genes thought to have the same function). The values output by this program reflect the similarities of the transformation patterns as well as those of the surrounding conserved substructures.. . . Massive-scale sequencing data. DNA and RNA sequences were obtained from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and DDBJ SRA (http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/dra/index_e.html) databases35. Raw RNA-sequencing data for each insect were downloaded from SRA and then assembled with Trinity50, one of the most effective RNA-sequencing assemblers. The obtained Trinity contigs were used as training datasets in the AUGUSTUS program51 to predict protein-coding sequences in the corresponding insect genome downloaded from NCBI. This analysis generated a list of putative protein sequences encoded in the corresponding insect genomes.. . . Data Availability.

PMC5368702	1. Introduction. DNA replication is essential in all living organisms. It is highly complex and regulated at many levels to ensure accurate and timely duplication of genetic information. Defects in the pathways involved in DNA synthesis and/or repair can lead to mutagenesis and chromosomal rearrangements, both of which are central causes for cancer, aging, and other genetic diseases.. Aside from the DNA damage events that happen under physiological conditions [1], eukaryotic genomes themselves present a wide range of natural impediments to DNA replication [2]. A subset of these impediments, called replication fork barriers (RFBs), can slow down or stall the progression of the replication machinery. If not properly regulated, RFBs could lead to fork collapse and a consequent increase in the susceptibility to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). RFBs can arise from inherently difficult-to-replicate DNA sequences that form secondary structures, such as repetitive and palindromic DNA sequences. In addition, RFBs can originate from a variety of complexes formed by DNA and non-nucleosomal proteins present along the eukaryotic genome [3]. In eukaryotes, RFBs can be found at telomeres, centromeres, highly transcribed genes, and origins of replication, among other locations [2]. Furthermore, some of these RFBs act as programmed polar pausing sites for the replication machinery in order to control other biological processes, such as mating-type switching in Schizosaccharomyces pombe [4]. Understanding how the replication machinery copes with such a variety of circumstances in each round of DNA replication is a subject of intense research.. Another type of natural impediment that occurs during DNA replication is the encounter between the replication machinery and other enzymatic complexes that also operate on the DNA. Particularly, numerous studies have demonstrated that encounters between the replisome and the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) complex cause replication stress and genomic instability [5]. In addition, the transcription process itself could be a source of DNA damage. This is, in part, due to the inherent process of DNA unwinding and exposure of ssDNA that contributes to mutations and DNA damage followed by recombination events.. Here we provide an overview of the major types of natural impediments found by the replication machinery. We will first discuss RFBs formed by repetitive DNA sequences and non-histone DNA-binding proteins. We will then focus on the mechanisms that regulate the coordination between transcription and replication machineries, as collisions between the two machineries may result in transcription-associated recombination and mutagenesis. Supplementary Table S1 summarizes a variety of replication impediments in humans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. . . . 2. Replication Barriers Associated with Repeat DNA and ProteinDNA Complexes. RFBs have been reported at rDNA arrays, centromeres, telomeres, mating-type locus, and tRNA genes [6]. In some cases, RFBs may function to coordinate replication and transcription processes and/or to prevent replication slippage at repetitive DNA loci. Other RFBs are genetically programed to establish a site where genomic instability is created under tight cellular control in order to achieve cellular differentiation.. . 2.1. Telomeres. Telomeres are the physical ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. They provide a mechanism for full replication of the chromosomal ends while protecting these ends from DNA degradation and recombination. At the same time, several telomeric features pose challenges to the replication machinery (Figure 1). At telomeres, replication forks proceed in a unidirectional manner from a centromere-proximal origin [7,8]. Although some later reports suggest that replication could also be initiated within the telomeric repeats [9,10,11], the unidirectional nature of telomere replication may present a problem for complete replication of chromosomal ends [12]. Furthermore, the repetitive nature of their DNA sequence, the presence of heterochromatin proteins and chromatin remodeling marks, and the potential to form T-loop structures make telomeres difficult-to-replicate templates for DNA replication (Figure 1).. In both S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, telomeric repeat DNA sequences can slow down replication fork progression at their native loci (chromosomal ends) and also at internal chromosomal regions when tracts of telomeric repeats are artificially inserted [7,13]. Although the nature of the telomeric replication barrier is not well understood, Gadaleta et al. recently showed that the repetitive nature of the telomeric DNA, but not other telomeric features, is the major cause for unstable replisomes in the absence of Swi1 [14]. Swi1 is a subunit of the fork protection complex (FPC: S. pombe Swi1Swi3; S. cerevisiae Tof1Csm3; metazoan TimelessTipin). The FPC travels with the replisome in order to protect replication fork structures at various RFBs [15,16]. Interestingly, the same study showed that swi1 mutants display increased DNA damage and recombination at telomeres, leading to activation of ALT-like pathways of telomere maintenance, suggesting a role of Swi1 as an anti-recombinase at the telomere [14,17]. Consistently, depletion of Timeless (human homolog of Swi1) results in increased levels of DNA repair foci and sister chromatid exchange in mouse cells, indicative of elevated levels of homologous recombination [18]. Furthermore, Timeless interacts with the telomere-binding protein TRF1 and prevents telomere abnormalities in human cells [19], which demonstrates a conserved role of Timeless-related proteins in telomere protection.. In fission yeast, replication through telomeric repeats is facilitated by the telomere-binding protein Taz1, a member of the Myb/SANT DNA-binding domain-containing family of proteins [7,20]. Loss of Taz1 leads to replication fork pausing in the vicinity of telomeres and also at telomere tracts inserted within the chromosome [7]. TRF1, the mammalian homolog of Taz1, is also required for efficient telomere replication [11]. Conflicting data were obtained from experiments done in vitro. In a cell-free SV40 replication system, TRF1 and TRF2 significantly inhibit replication fork progression through the telomeric-repeat tract inserted in a plasmid [19,21]. In addition, overexpression of TRF1 and TRF2 in HeLa cells slowed down replication fork progression through telomeric repeats, suggesting that telomere-binding proteins such as TRF1 and TRF2 obstruct the passage of the replisome [21]. A more recent publication suggests that overexpression of TRF1 in the SV40 system might sequester key replisome factors that are essential for efficient telomere replication, pointing out this observation as the reason for the controversial findings [22].. In S. cerevisiae, replication forks stall at telomeric and subtelomeric regions in a manner independent of the repeat orientation [13]. Fork stalling at telomeres likely requires Rap1, while other telomeric and subtelomeric proteins including Reb1, Tbf1, Rif1, Rif2, Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 are not significant obstacles for replication fork progression [23]. In addition, telomere length can affect the timing of telomere replication: while normal telomeres replicate late in S phase, short telomeres replicate earlier. One of the underlying mechanisms of this timing switch has been recently described. Late replication timing of normal telomeres requires Rif1. However, at short telomeres, Tel1-mediated phosphorylation of Rif1 seems to override this effect and cause early replication of telomeres in budding yeast [24].. G-quadruplexes are another important replication obstacle that can arise at telomeres due to their repetitive GT-rich sequence. Studies have suggested a role for TRF1-related proteins in recruiting DNA helicases to aid in replication of telomeres. These include mammalian RTEL (regulator of telomere length) and BLM (Blooms syndrome) helicases, which may resolve G-quadruplex structures during DNA replication [11,25]. In yeast, DNA helicases such as S. cerevisiae Pif1 and S. pombe Pfh1 suppress G-quadruplex-induced genomic instability and facilitate efficient telomere replication [26,27,28]. Further details on the role of G-quadruplexes as natural replicative obstacles are provided in a later section of this review article.. . . 2.2. rDNA Repeats. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is found as tandem repeats localized at discreet locations in the genome. Each eukaryotic rDNA transcription unit contains sequences encoding 1618S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and 2528S rRNA (Figure 2). The transcription units are separated by the non-transcribed spacers, where replication barriers are located in most eukaryotic species, including yeast, ciliates (Tetrahymena thermophila), pea (Pisum sativum), frog (Xenopus laevis), mouse (Mus musculus), and humans. During S phase, these barriers lead to replication fork arrest, which is likely to coordinate transcription, replication, and recombination at these loci [29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38].. A significant volume of research focused on understanding genome stability at rDNA repeats has been carried out using S. pombe. The S. pombe genome contains 100150 copies of rDNA repeats at the ends of chromosome III. Each 10.9-kb repeat unit is composed of the 35S rDNA transcriptional unit and a non-transcribed region that contains an origin of replication (ori3001) and four closely spaced polar replication barriers (Ter1/RFB1, Ter2/RFB2, Ter3/RFB3 and RFP4) that block replication forks moving in opposite direction to the transcription machinery (Figure 2A) [38,39,40]. A group of factors is involved in fork pausing at Ter13. In contrast to Ter13, no trans-acting factor has been identified for RFP4, and this barrier is not functional when placed in a plasmid [41]. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that, in the absence of Reb1, Swi1, or Swi3, the intensity of fork-pausing signal increases at RFP4. This suggests that pausing at RFP4 may be a consequence of replication and transcription machineries colliding at RFP4 when the three main barriers (Ter13) fail to pause the replication fork [39].. Replication pausing at Ter13 requires the FPC subunits, Swi1 and Swi3 in S. pombe [39,40]. Switch-activating protein 1 (Sap1) and Reb1 function as trans-acting elements that cause fork pausing by binding to the replication barriers in the rDNA repeats. Sap1 is responsible for the barrier activity at Ter1 and is also involved in chromatin formation, checkpoint activation, and genome stability (Figure 2A). Loss of Sap1 causes defects in chromosome segregation, and mutations that affect Sap1-DNA binding in vitro compromise the barrier activity at Ter1 [41,42,43,44,45,46]. In addition to its role in fork pausing at Ter1, Sap1 has barrier activity at long terminal repeats (LTRs) [47]. Sap1 also binds to the SAS1 region at the mating-type locus, although it does not promote barrier activity at this site, possibly due to lower affinity binding that fails to produce fork stalling at this particular site [41,48].. Reb1 is a member of the Myb/SANT family of proteins and is related to the mammalian transcription termination factor-1 (TTF-1) [39,40]. In S. pombe, Reb1 binds to Ter23 in the rDNA (Figure 2A) and Ter-like sites present outside the rDNA throughout the genome. Like Sap1, Reb1 acts as a dimer and causes DNA bending when bound to two separate sites in cis [49]. When bound to Ter23 at the rDNA repeats, Reb1 not only mediates polar barrier activity for replication forks moving towards the transcription machinery, but also arrests transcription catalyzed by RNA Pol I from the opposite direction [50,51]. This is different from Sap1, which may not affect the progression of the transcription machinery. Later work showed that Reb1 binds to Ter sites located outside the rDNA, where it promotes DNA looping between two Ter sites. This type of inter-chromosomal interactions, called chromosome kissing appears to cause transcription and replication termination [49,52]. Interestingly, Reb1 also functions as an activator of RNA Pol II-dependent transcription at certain promoters [49,53].. Budding yeast Fob1 regulates rDNA recombination by causing polar replication fork arrest at RFB sites (Figure 2B), by facilitating protein-mediated chromosome kissing [54]. Fob1 also recruits silencing factors such as Sir2 and the RENT complex to the same sites [55,56,57,58,59]. However, Fob1s function in rDNA silencing appears to be independent on its role in fork arrest; when the S. cerevisiae FPC components Tof1 or Csm3 are inactivated, fork pausing is lost at the RFB sites, but the silencing activity of Fob1 remains intact [60]. Interestingly, S. pombe Reb1 tethers the mating-type locus to rDNA Ter sites in order to facilitate gene silencing of the mating-type locus through heterochromatin formation [61]. Therefore, although Reb1 and Fob1 fail to show structural similarities at the level of amino acid sequences, these two proteins share common functions, which are promoted by chromosome kissing. Further investigation will shed light on how Reb1 and Fob1, through chromosome kissing, aid in the coordination of transcription and replication processes.. In mice and human cells, replication fork arrest occurs within repeated regions called Sal boxes located downstream from the ribosomal 47S pre-rRNA-coding region (Figure 2C) [62,63]. Sal boxes recruit TTF-1, the mammalian ortholog of S. pombe Reb1, which is involved in termination of pre-mRNA transcription [64]. As is the case for S. pombe Swi1 and S. cerevisiae Tof1, human Timeless is required for replication fork arrest at RFBs to coordinate the progression of replication with transcription activity in HeLa cells (Figure 2C) [65]. Thus, the role of the FPC at these pausing sites is conserved between yeast and mammalian cells. However, unlike in yeast, where replication pauses at the RFBs in a polar manner, replication in mammalian cells can be blocked in both directions [36,66].. The mechanism by which the FPC operates at RFB has begun to be elucidated. In S. cerevisiae, Tof1 and Csm3 are phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation promotes association of the FPC to the replication fork via interaction with the CMG helicase. At RFB sites, the FPC promotes stable fork arrest by antagonizing the Rrm3 helicase and thus preventing the removal of Fob1 [67,68,69]. In mammalian cells, the FPC inhibits the helicase activity of the CMG complex and the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of mini chromosome maintenance (Mcm) 27 proteins [70]. Although these studies are performed in vitro, it is possible that the FPC inhibits DNA helicase activity to promote fork arrest at programmed fork pausing sites throughout the chromosome. In addition to Timeless- and Tipin-related proteins, the FPC functions together with a third component, Claspin/Mrc1, which is required for activation of the inter-S phase checkpoint [71,72]. In S. pombe, Mrc1 is associated with FPC and plays a role in replication fork pausing at rDNA repeats, MPS1 and RTS1 at the mating-type locus, and tRNA genes. This function of S. pombe Mrc1 is mediated via a conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain that is also present in metazoan Claspin, but not in S. cerevisiae Mrc1 [73]. Future investigation is warranted to understand the molecular role of Claspin/Mrc1 in fork pausing.. Lastly, a recent study has suggested a role for Dicer (Dcr1) in replication fork arrest at rDNA loci. Dcr1, the enzyme that processes precursor RNAs into small interfering RNA (siRNA), is required for rDNA copy number maintenance [74]. Dcr1 regulates transcription termination and maintains genome stability at rDNA and other replication-pausing sites, such as protein-coding genes and transfer RNA genes (tRNAs). Collisions may occur between transcription and replication at these sites as represented by RNA Pol II enrichment in the absence of Dcr1. Such a role of Dcr1 in coordinating transcription and replication seems to be independent of its role in the RNAi pathway, as there is no RNA Pol II enrichment at these sites when mutations that abolish the canonical RNAi pathway were introduced [74]. Interestingly, dcr1 swi3 double deletion mutants show synthetic growth defects and hypersensitivity to replication-stressing agents [75], suggesting a role for Dicer in fork pausing at rDNA loci. Therefore, it appears that multiple pathways cooperate together to ensure fork pausing at rDNAs in order to preserve genomic integrity.. . . 2.3. Centromeres. Centromeres are large chromatin structures responsible for the proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis [76,77]. Defects in centromere regulation result in chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy [78,79]. Centromeres are characterized by an intricate structure that generates obstacles for DNA replication [80,81]. In most species, centromeres are organized into two domains; a pericentromeric heterochromatin region and a centromeric core defined by the presence of the centromere-specific histone, CENP-A (centromere protein A), where the kinetochore assembles (Figure 3). The kinetochore is a multi-protein complex that mediates the attachment of spindle microtubules to centromeres [78,82,83]. This configuration of centromeres, termed regional, is more common in mammals and other eukaryotic model organisms including S. pombe, Drosophila Melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Neurospora crassa, and Oryza sativa [84]. In contrast, S. cerevisiae centromeres are defined by an ~125-bp DNA sequence and termed point centromeres because of their simple organization (Figure 3A) [76]. Replication fork pausing was detected at centromeres of various chromosomes (CEN1, CEN3, CEN4 and CEN6), thus the ability to promote fork pausing seems to be a general property of S. cerevisiae centromeres [80,85]. Replication barriers at centromeres differ from those at rDNA and the mating-type locus in the sense that they do not completely stop replication but mostly cause fork pausing [80]. Furthermore, centromeric barriers appear to be non-polar and thus are able to pause forks coming from both directions. Studies that looked at replication fork pausing at CEN3 and CEN4 showed that pausing at these sites is dependent on Tof1 but not Mrc1 [86]. In addition, it is suggested that fork pausing at centromeres is mediated by proteinDNA complexes that involve the centromere-binding factor CBF3 (Figure 3A) [80], which is required for kinetochore formation and proper chromosome segregation [87]. Consistently, in Candida albicans, the kinetochore functions as a replication barrier at the centromere [88]. In this organism, which is genetically related to S. cerevisiae, centromeres have a more complex organization than in S. cerevisiae and span approximately 3 kb on each chromosome. In C. albicans, fork stalling at centromeres decreases in the absence of Rad51 and Rad52, two main homologous recombination factors involved in fork restart. Failure in fork stalling is attributed to the defects in kinetochore assembly found in rad51 and rad52 mutant cells. Studies demonstrated that Rad51 and Rad52 promote the recruitment of CENP-A at the programmed fork-stalling sites at early replicating centromeres [88]. Therefore, it is straightforward to suggest that kinetochore structures present significant obstacles to replisome progression. However, whether the replication forks can pass through the DNA-protein complex or the complex disassembles before replication is not understood.. S. pombe has regional centromeres and their organization is similar to that of higher eukaryotes (Figure 3B,C) [76,89]. Replication forks appear to stall at S. pombe centromeres probably due to the presence of highly repetitive DNA sequences and heterochromatin marks, both considered to be difficult-to-replicate features [81,90]. Contrary to other heterochromatin regions including telomeres, centromeres in fission yeast replicate early in S phase [91]. The early replication of centromeres is linked to RNAi expression and heterochromatin assembly [92,93], and RNAi-mediated silencing pathways play a conserved role across species at heterochromatin regions and transposons [94,95]. Interestingly, the integrity of centromeres is maintained by its heterochromatin configuration and replication-fork-stabilizing factors that inhibit recombination at centromeres [96]. These findings suggest a role of heterochromatin and RNAi in replication fork pausing at centromeres (Figure 3B). Consistently, CENP-B (centromere protein B), which is associated with centromeric heterochromatin, is suggested to have a critical role in preservation of genomic integrity when forks are paused [47]. Furthermore, Zaratiegui et al. demonstrated that the RNAi machinery releases RNA Pol II from the DNA, allowing for the completion of DNA replication and preventing collisions between transcription and replication machineries [75]. Failure to release RNA Pol II causes fork stalling and promotes activation of homologous recombination pathways for repair. Furthermore, low concentrations of the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea that is innocuous to RNAi-deficient mutants, including dcr1, ago1 and rdp1 mutants, become highly toxic when the FPC component Swi3 was also deleted from these cells. Thus, stalled forks in the absence of the RNAi pathway are maintained by the FPC in order to prevent genomic instability [75]. Consistent with these results, in Xenopus, the Swi3 homolog Tipin is required for efficient replication of centromeric DNA and works together with Mta2, the activator subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex (NuRD) to prevent fork reversal, most probably at difficult-to-replicate sites [97]. Further investigation is required to elucidate the details of how fork pausing is established at centromeres.. . . 2.4. tRNA Genes and LTR Retrotransposons. Genetic screenings in S. cerevisiae identified numerous essential genes involved in preventing spontaneous DNA damage and genome rearrangements [98,99,100]. These include many DNA replication factors involved in different stages of DNA replication processes (initiation: CDC45, DBF4, DPB11, MCM4, MCM5, MCM7, and PSF2; elongation: CDC45, DNA2, MCM4, MCM5, MCM7, POL2, POL30, PSF2, RFC2, and RFC5; and termination: UBC9) [100]. Importantly, genome rearrangements were mapped to yeast fragile sites, including Ty retrotransposons, tRNA genes, early origins of replication, and replication termination sites [100]. These sites are prone to fork stalling, breakage, and chromosomal rearrangements, particularly, when DNA replication is compromised [101,102] or when checkpoint activation is defective [103,104,105].. Early work in budding yeast identified polar replication pause sites at Ty1-LTR and tRNA genes. These sites arrest forks moving in opposite direction to transcription [106] and may represent fragile sites when DNA replication is compromised, leading to genomic instability. Indeed, when the level of DNA polymerase  is reduced, chromosome translocations were greatly induced due to hyper-recombination at Ty elements [101].. Eukaryotic genomes contain a large number of tRNA genes, which are highly transcribed by RNA Pol III [107]. The program tRNAscan-SE [108] identified 186 and 286 tRNA genes in fission and budding yeast, respectively. The same program also identified 513 tRNAs in humans and 430 tRNAs in mouse [109]. In addition to their role in decoding mRNA sequences to proteins, tRNA genes also function in genome organization and stability [110]. tRNA genes and related RNA Pol III promoter elements can act as DNA replication barriers, as well as boundaries to separate different chromatin domains that comprise regulatory gene expression units [106,111,112]. Although this chromatin-boundary function has only been demonstrated in yeast, there is potential for these sites to play a similar role in mammalian cells as well [113].. In S. cerevisiae, fork pausing at tRNA genes requires Tof1 but not Mrc1, similar to what occurs at centromeres [86]. Active transcription of tRNA genes is also required for their replication-barrier activity [106]. Two hypotheses can explain the formation of these barriers; the first argues that supercoiling in the parental strand generated by the transcription and replication complexes causes a significant topological stress that prevents the progression of the replication fork. The second hypothesis proposes that barrier activity at these tRNA genes is a consequence of the direct interaction between replication and transcription machineries [106]. Although both hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, the exact nature of the replication barriers at tRNA genes is still subject of debate.. The replication barriers at tRNA genes may prevent collisions between replication and transcription machineries (Figure 4A). This idea is based on the studies that used mutations in the S. cerevisiae Rrm3 helicase, a member of the Pif1 DNA helicase family involved in genome maintenance [114]. rrm3 mutations result in an increase in fork pausing and recombination potential at tRNA genes [85,103]. The elevated recombination appears to be dependent on collisions between RNA Pol III and the replication machinery in the absence of Rrm3, although the DNA sequences at the tRNA pausing sites themselves may not be highly recombinogenic [115]. tRNA pausing in rrm3 mutants is eliminated when the TFIIIC complex, required for transcription initiation, is removed from a tRNA gene [85]. Rrm3 appears to be a component of the replisome complex, providing a sweepase activity throughout the genome, in order to remove non-nucleosomal proteinDNA complexes ahead of the replication fork [116]. Such a sweepase function is conserved in S. pombe Pfh1, a Pif1-related DNA helicase [117]. Therefore, both proteinDNA complexes and transcription activity itself may contribute to the barrier or fork pausing activity at tRNA genes.. In S. pombe, tRNA genes can act as nonpolar replication fork barriers. About half of all 171 tRNA genes constitute fork pausing sites and bind to Pfh1, a helicase suggested to promote replication by displacing RNA Pol III from DNA during replication [118]. In contrast to rDNA fork barriers, tRNA barrier activity is independent of the FPC subunit Swi1. However, Swi1 still has an important role at tRNA genes; while in wild-type cells, the presence of tRNAs does not constitute a recombination hotspot, in swi1 cells, tRNAs become recombination hotspots and a source of genomic instability even though replication forks pause at tRNA genes at similar levels in both wild-type and swi1 cells [112]. It is noteworthy that the sequence homology between different tRNA copies and their clustered organization in the genome are thought to enhance the recombinogenic potential at tRNA loci [119]. Consistent with the role of Swi1 at tRNA genes, swi1 mutants show increased Rad3ATR-dependent H2A phosphorylation at tRNA loci, suggesting high rates of DNA damage and recombination events in the absence of the FPC [120]. Since fork pausing does not seem to correlate with the levels of recombination at tRNAs, the way by which Swi1 regulates fork stability at these sites might be different than that at other replication barriers [112]. In contrast, deletion of Tof1, S. cerevisiae Swi1 homolog, leads to the loss of fork pausing at tRNAs (Figure 4A). Fork pausing at tRNA genes is restored in tof1 rrm3 mutants [68,85], and similar interactions between Tof1Csm3 and Rrm3 were found at the Ter sites in the rDNA [68]. Therefore, although tRNA genes and other RNA Pol III-transcribed elements can become recombinogenic targets when fork stability is impaired by loss of the FPC, there seems to be a fundamental difference in the establishment of fork pausing at tRNA genes between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae.. Retrotransposons are ubiquitously present in most genomes and they are involved in genome organization, function, and evolution [121]. These elements replicate via an RNA intermediate that converts into cDNA, which is then inserted along the genome. The fission yeast genome contains two types of LTR retrotransposons, Tf1 and Tf2 [122]. Recent studies revealed that Sap1, a DNA-binding factor that promotes fork pausing at rDNA loci, plays a critical role in targeting LTR retrotransposons to specific genome sites (Figure 4B) [123]. Both Tf1 and Tf2 are preferentially targeted to nucleosome free regions that coincide with RNA Pol II-transcribed gene promoters [124,125]. Interestingly, Sap1 is also identified as a trans-acting general regulatory factor that binds to nucleosome free regions and promotes nucleosome eviction [126]. Consistent with this finding, Sap1 tethers the Tf1 cDNA to Sap1-binding sites, thus guiding the insertion of the Tf1 transposons along the chromosome in a manner dependent on Sap1s ability to arrest replication forks [123]. Tf2 LTR transposons in S. pombe function as polar replication barriers. Deletion of abp1 and cbh1, two CENP-B homologs, causes recombination at these LTRs (Figure 4B), and this phenotype is suppressed in the sap1-c mutant in which Sap1 fails to bind to LTRs [47]. These results suggest that Abp1 and Cbh1 play a role in preventing genomic instability at LTRs (Figure 4B). Although the mechanisms by which CENP-B-related proteins regulate replication barriers are still elusive, Abp1 is reported to inhibit the expression of the transposons and neighboring genes by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) [127]. Abp1 also affects expression of Tf1 and adjacent genes; Abp1 bound to Tf1 decreases transcription of adjacent stress genes, which might in turn prevent collisions with replication machinery and thus decrease recombination at the barrier [128]. Furthermore, Abp1 localizes to tRNA genes, suggesting a role of Abp1 in fork stability at tRNA genes [47]. Therefore, it is possible that CENP-B-related proteins regulate transcription of transposons and tRNAs, modulating replication barrier activity in order to prevent genomic instability at these loci.. Although there is no apparent Sap1 homolog, a similar mechanism of retrotransposon targeting at RFBs may be used in S. cerevisiae. For example, Ty1 retrotransposons are preferentially targeted at the 5 region of Pol III-transcribed genes where replication forks are known to pause. However, unlike the case in S. pombe, Ty1 retrotransposons appear to be targeted to specific surfaces of the nucleosome and this integration process may be regulated by chromatin remodeling and modifying factors [129,130,131].. . . 2.5. Fork Pausing and Termination at the Fission Yeast Mating-Type Locus. Two of the most studied replication-fork block sites are involved in the process of mating-type switching in fission yeast. Each fission yeast cell carries one of two mating types, P or M, which depends on the allele (mat2-P or mat3-M, respectively) present at the mating-type (mat1) locus [4]. There are two FPC-dependent replication-block sites near mat1: the mat1-pausing site 1 (MPS1) and replication termination site 1 (RTS1) (Figure 5) [132]. As is the case for other programmed fork-pausing sites, a Myb/SANT-related protein is involved in mating-type switching. Rtf1, which has two Myb/SANT domains, directly binds to repeat DNA motifs at RTS1 to block replisome progression (Figure 5) [133]. This strong polar replication block allows only one replication fork to move into the mat1 locus. The moving fork pauses at MPS1, generating the essential imprint that initiates a replication-coupled recombination process, leading to the mating-type switch event [134,135]. Other trans-acting factors are necessary for mating-type switching; replication fork pausing at MPS1 is dependent on Lsd1 and Lsd2 (Figure 5) [136], lysine-specific demethylases that are required for demethylation of histone H3 at its lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 9 (H3K9) residues for transcriptional regulation [137,138,139]. Lsd1 and Lsd2 appear to work upstream of the FPC to pause replication forks because recruitment of Swi1 at MPS1 is significantly reduced in the lsd1-mutant [136]. Interestingly, Lsd1 and Lsd2 are also required at other FPC-mediated fork pausing sites including RTS1 and RFBs at rDNA repeats, suggesting a role for either of these demethylases in FPC-dependent fork pausing. These findings may also suggest a role of histone modifications in replication-fork pausing at MPS1; however, Set1 and Clr4 methyltransferases, which specifically methylate H3K4 and H3K9, respectively, were not involved in the fork pausing [136]. Consistently, a non-enzymatic function of Lsd1 in chromatin regulation has also been suggested [140,141]. Future studies should determine if the role of Lsd1 and Lsd2 demethylases in fork pausing is exclusively enzymatic or if they also have a direct and structural role in FPC recruitment and fork pausing.. . . 2.6. DNA Barriers Mediated by Repetitive DNA and Secondary Structures. Inverted repeats (IRs), mirror repeats (MRs), and direct tandem repeats (DTRs) are all common features of eukaryotic genomes that have potential to undergo structural transitions and generate secondary structures [142]. IRs can form cruciform structures in double-stranded DNA and hairpins in ssDNA, while MRs can assemble intramolecular triple-helices called H-DNA. DTRs can adopt a wide range of structures that depend on their base composition. The best-studied examples are G-quadruplexes, which are formed by tandem guanidines (Figure 6) [2]. Over two-dozen human hereditary disorders are caused by repeat expansions or contractions attributed to defects in DNA replication. While trinucleotide repeat instability is the cause of the majority of these diseases, including fragile X mental retardation [143], Huntingtons disease [144], and myotonic dystrophy [145], expansion of tetra, penta and dodecameric repeats are also linked to human diseases [146,147,148]. Therefore, understanding how cells achieve accurate replication of these structures is of importance.. DNA triplex structures form in vivo and cause replication fork pausing and genomic instability [149,150,151,152,153]. Although some reports suggest that triplex DNA can act as a replication obstacle [154,155,156,157], others propose that the unusual structure of the triplex DNA is recognized as DNA damage and processed by DNA repair proteins [158].. G-quadruplexes are stable DNA secondary structures that are formed by the stacking of groups of four guanidine residues within a single or multiple DNA strands and stabilized by Hoogsteen bonds (Figure 6) [159]. Although their formation in vivo is still under debate, G-quadruplex formation is favored by processes that open the double helix and expose ssDNA. Such processes include transcription and DNA replication, where G-quadruplexes can emerge at both leading and lagging strands [160]. Sequences that can potentially form G-quadruplexes in vitro, called G4 motifs, are highly prevalent in bacterial and eukaryotic genomes. In S. pombe, G4 motifs are enriched at telomeres, RNA Pol II-dependent promoters, and rDNA repeats, and such distribution of G4 motifs is conserved in S. cerevisiae and human genomes [161,162,163,164]. G-quadruplexes can stall prokaryote and eukaryote DNA polymerases in vitro [165,166] and are highly mutagenic in vivo [167]. Thus, G-quadruplexes could constitute physical barriers for the replication machinery [2], posing a serious threat to genome stability [160]. Consistently, in humans, fork stalling and genome instability associated with G4 motifs are linked to common translocation events associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [168].. G-quadruplex formation may be especially favored during lagging-strand replication, leading to genomic instability as replication forks may stall at these structures (Figure 6) [159]. G-quadruplexes were shown to hinder DNA synthesis by human DNA polymerase  and several translesion polymerases [169]. Consistently, early studies demonstrated that, in E. coli, repeat loss occurs preferentially during lagging-strand synthesis [170]. Nonetheless, formation of G-quadruplexes can also occur in the leading strand and create instability, in particular, when these structures are stabilized by Phen-DC3 or introduced in a helicase-deficient pif1 background [160].. Several classes of DNA helicases are involved in resolution of G-quadruplexes, and mutations in many of these helicases are known to cause human diseases associated with genomic instability. One class of DNA helicases involved in G4-unwinding contains an iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster involved in accepting and donating electrons [171]. One such helicase, FANCJ (Fanconi anemia complementation group J), is involved in the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway and is required for the repair of interstrand crosslinks [172]. FANCJ unwinds G-quadruplexes in the context of telomeric- and triplet-repeat DNA sequences in vitro. This activity is inhibited by a telomestatin that specifically binds G-quadruplexes [173]. Telomestatin also inhibits growth and induces DNA damage in FANCD2-deficient human cells, suggesting a role for FANCJ in unwinding G-quadruplexes in vivo [173,174]. Consistently, fork stalling occurs at a higher rate in FANCJ-deleted avian DT40 cells, suggesting that FANCJ is required for efficient replication through G-quadruplexes. Defects in the FA pathway are associated with bone marrow failure and a strong predisposition to cancer [172], although FANCJ DNA helicase appears to unwind G-quadruplexes independently of the FA pathway [173,175].. Another class of G4-unwinding helicases includes RecQ-related helicases WRN (Werners syndrome) and BLM, whose mutations cause cancer susceptible disorders Werner and Bloom syndromes, respectively [171]. These helicases have G4-unwinding activity in vitro and facilitate DNA replication through G-quadruplexes at telomeres [171,176]. These helicases unwind duplexes in the 35 direction, which is the opposite polarity to FANCJ-mediated unwinding activity. Interestingly, BLM interacts directly with FANCJ, and together, these helicases unwind a damaged DNA substrate more efficiently than either single helicase [177]. Furthermore, FANCJ functions in concert with both BLM and WRN to maintain epigenetic stability at a G-quadruplex-containing locus, suggesting that these helicases remove G-quadruplex from opposite directions [178].. Finally, the Pif1-related helicases have robust G-quadruplex unwinding activity. Using purified proteins, the Zakian group showed that budding yeast Pif1 preferentially binds and unwind G-quadruplex DNA. Strikingly, Pif1 was much more efficient in G-quadruplex unwinding than human WRN, E. coli RecQ, and Sgs1 (budding yeast RecQ) [27]. In S. pombe, Pfh1, a Pif1-related helicase, is preferentially recruited to regions with G4 motifs and unwinds G-quadruplex structures. In the absence of Pfh1, replication forks pause at G-quadruplexes, leading to DNA damage and genome instability [28]. A recent paper shows that, both telomeric and rDNA sequences from S. pombe, can form G-quadruplexes in vitro and that Pfh1 is able to unwind these structures [179]. Interestingly, a study suggested that G-quadruplexes not only pose replicative obstacles but also function as regulatory elements that aid in lagging-strand synthesis [180], and emerging evidence suggest the role as cis-acting regulatory elements of G-quadruplexes in DNA replication as well as in transcription, translation, and telomere maintenance [181]. Interestingly, G-quadruplexes are extensively found near transcriptional start sites (TSS). Such DNA secondary structures at TSS may affect DNA topology, creating a dynamic equilibrium between duplex DNA and secondary conformation, in order to not only regulate transcription [182,183], but also control replication initiation [184,185,186]. Further studies are necessary to understand the mechanisms by which G-quadruplex DNA regulates multiple cellular processes.. . . . 3. Coordination between Transcription and Replication Machineries. DNA replication and gene transcription are fundamental genetic processes required for cell growth and division. Both processes are carried out by large protein complexes that move processively along the genome and cause temporary but significant alterations to the DNA structure. Collisions between the transcription and replication machineries are a clear source of genomic instability in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [187,188,189], and have recently been linked to oncogene-induced DNA damage in cancer cells [190]. In this section, we attempt to summarize the current knowledge on the molecular basis of transcriptionreplication encounters and the consequences of their dysregulation.. . 3.1. TranscriptionReplication Encounters. Transcriptionreplication encounters can occur when the transcription and the replication machineries move in the opposite direction and converge upon each other (head-on collision). Because these machineries have different velocities, collision also occurs when the two machineries move in the same direction (co-directional collision) (Figure 7). Studies in E. coli and S. cerevisiae show that transcription impedes replisome progression, resulting in the arrest of replication forks [191,192,193]. Activation of DNA damage response pathways, elevated mutagenesis, and chromosomal instability at actively transcribed loci suggest that replication forks also collapse upon encountering the transcription machinery (Figure 7) [194,195].. Head-on collisions are thought to be more detrimental than co-directional collisions. The effect of transcription directionality on fork progression was initially studied in bacteria using inverted ribosomal RNA operons that are naturally transcribed in a co-directional fashion with replication [196]. This and other studies in E. coli and B. subtilis demonstrated that replication slows down when transcription units are arranged in a head-on direction with respect to fork movement, as compared to transcription units arranged in a co-directional manner [192,196,197]. Head-on collisions were also shown to generate positive supercoiling that could lead to fork reversal and the formation of chicken-foot structures [198]. Furthermore, large-scale genome organization studies in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes show that genes are positioned so that their transcription is co-directional with replication fork movement. This organization tends to be more pronounced near origins of replication and weakens as the distance to the origins increases [188,199,200].. Spatiotemporal separation between transcription and replication may be another evolutionary solution to prevent collisions. Although bacteria species lack temporal separation [2], eukaryotic replication and transcription occur within spatially and temporally separated domains [201]. Although the majority of transcriptional activity in eukaryotes occurs during G1 phase, there are transcriptionally active loci in S phase, and these loci seem to be spatially separated from replicating regions [202]. Transcription and replication of rRNA genes (rDNA) in mammalian cells are an excellent example of such coordination [203,204]. Each rDNA locus undergoes a temporal sequence of reprogramming from active transcription to active replication. Following replication, the rDNA loci are reprogrammed for transcription [205]. In terms of spatial separation, actively transcribed rRNA genes are exclusively localized in the interior of the nucleolus [206,207], and replicating loci seem to be physically separated from their transcription by fibrillar centers that provide a structural barrier between domains [203]. In S. cerevisiae, actively transcribed genes localize near nuclear pores [208,209]. Although this may alleviate transcriptionreplication encounters by spatially separating transcription and replication activities, such genome reorganization can increase torsional stress in DNA associated with active transcription, causing negative consequences to both transcription and replication processes.. . . 3.2. Highly Transcribed Regions as Replicative Obstacles. Studies suggest that replication forks pause during head-on encounters with the transcription machinery but only collapse in the presence of RNA polymerase arrays at highly transcribed operons [188]. Transcription-dependent fork pausing was reported in E. coli, both in vitro using phage components [191,210] and in vivo on plasmids [192], and in a chromosomal context [211]. In eukaryotes, a genome-wide analysis of DNA polymerase pause sites was performed in S. cerevisiae. This study demonstrated that highly transcribed RNA Pol II-dependent genes were significantly represented as replication pausing sites [211]. In fission yeast, replication fork pausing was also linked to increased recombination at the leu2 locus, which is transcribed by RNA Pol II [193]. Further investigation suggests that stalled replication is a prerequisite to hyper-recombination [212]. Null mutants of S. cerevisiae Hpr1, a component of the THO complex, exhibit hyperrecombination phenotypes in addition to defects in transcriptional elongation and mRNA export to the cytoplasm [213,214,215,216,217,218]. However, the hpr1-101 allele, which contains a point mutation in the hpr1 gene, fails to cause hyperrecombination phenotypes although transcriptional elongation and mRNA export are inhibited in the mutant. This loss of the hyperrecombination phenotype is correlated with the absence of replication fork blockage in hpr1 mutants, suggesting that hyperrecombination is caused by stalled replication forks [212]. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in replication pausing at transcription sites still remain unclear, DNA polymerase , a major replicative enzyme, is enriched throughout open reading frames in S. cerevisiae. Therefore, instead of promoter-associated protein complexes, the transcription machinery itself and/or nascent RNA seem to be the cause of replication fork pausing [211].. Studies in E. coli and B. subtilis have found that the intensity of the fork-arresting signal is correlated with the rate of transcription [192,196,197]. Highly transcribed genes impede replication when they are placed head-on to the replication fork, explaining why most highly expressed operons in bacteria are arranged in a co-directional orientation with respect to the direction of replication in the genome [199]. In eukaryotes, collisions at highly transcribed genes are blocked by DNAprotein barriers, as described above for rDNA repeats [219]. In addition to the rate of transcription, gene length also seems to play a role in genomic stability. Inverting long genes enhances the mutation rate in B. subtilis, suggesting that the co-directionality of long transcriptional units with replication prevents fork arrest and/or collapse in bacteria [220]. Consistently, many common fragile-sites (CFSs) in cancer cells co-localize with very large genes in human cells [221,222].. Several replication factors have been shown to play a specific role during replication of highly transcribed regions. The S. pombe Pfh1 helicase is required for efficient fork movement at highly transcribed RNA polymerase II-dependent genes and at other difficult-to-replicate regions such as rDNA loci. Because cells depleted of Phf1 are unviable in the absence of Swi1, accumulated stalled forks in the Pfh1 mutant cells may need to be stabilized by Swi1 for survival [223]. In relation to this idea, in budding yeast, roles of the Swi1/Timeless homolog, Tof1, and its partner, Csm3, were investigated for replisome protection at a RNA Pol III-dependent transcription site in a plasmid. Replication fork pausing is greatly attenuated in the tof1 mutant and significantly enhanced in the rrm3 mutant. Rrm3 is a member of the Pif1 family of helicases in budding yeast. Deletion of both tof1 and rrm3, restores pausing to a level significantly higher than that of the wild-type cells [68]. Furthermore, TimelessTipin homologs in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and humans control the RFBs of rDNA genes in order to prevent collisions between transcription and replication complexes during ribosomal gene transcription [39,65,68,224], suggesting the general role of TimelessTipin in preventing genome instability at the interface of DNA replication and transcription (Figure 7).. . . 3.3. Transcription-Associated Mutagenesis and Recombination. Transcription increases spontaneous and chemically induced mutations and also stimulates recombination. These events have been referred to as transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) and transcription-associated recombination (TAR), respectively (Figure 7) [193]. These mechanisms are conserved from bacteria to mammalian cells, and they both can be induced by transcriptionreplication collisions among other causes.. TAM can arise in a replication-dependent or -independent manner [225]. Although there is no strong evidence linking replication fork direction and TAM in higher eukaryotes, a higher rate of mutagenesis was reported in B. subtilis when transcription occurred in a head-on versus co-directional orientation [188]. In budding yeast, mutation rates are directly proportional to transcription levels; however, reversing the direction of replication subtly affects the occurrence of TAM [195]. Although the reason why head-on conflicts are more mutagenic than co-directional conflicts is not known, studies in yeast suggest that recombination might play a role. In particular, head-on transcriptionreplication collisions stimulate recombination more than co-directional encounters [226], and recombination-associated DNA synthesis appears to be an error-prone pathway [227,228].. Although TAR is a very prevalent process in all organisms, its mechanisms remain unclear. One of the first reports on the effect of transcription on genetic stability in a eukaryotic system showed that HOT1, a segment of the ribosomal DNA locus that is actively transcribed by RNA polymerase I, could function as a cis-acting enhancer of recombination in S. cerevisiae [229]. A similar increase in recombination and spontaneous mutations was observed with high transcription levels by RNA Pol II [230,231]. Two different hypotheses explain the stimulation of spontaneous recombination by transcription: the first one centers around the increased accessibility of homologous recombination proteins to the DNA during transcription; the second hypothesis suggests that collisions between the transcription and replication machineries, the presence of stalled replication forks during transcription, or the formation of transcription-associated DNA:RNA hybrids (R-loops) can be significant sources of DNA damage and TAR (Figure 8). R-loops are three-strand RNA:DNA hybrid structures, where the nascent RNA hybridizes with the DNA template and causes the nontemplate strand to remain as ssDNA. R-loop formation and stabilization impair transcriptional elongation [232], and the stalled transcription machinery may be more prone to replication fork stalling, inducing TAR (Figure 8) [213].. The accessibility hypothesis is supported by experiments done in yeast treated with DNA-damaging agents. In this setting, a synergistic effect on recombination was observed between treatment with DNA-damaging agents and induction of transcription in a plasmid system where transcription can be induced by the GAL1- or the tet-regulated promoters. These results suggest that TAR induced by DNA-damaging agents may be, to a large extent, caused by the increased accessibility to the DNA that the DNA-damaging agents have during transcription [233]. Other structures formed during transcription, such as transcription-induced supercoiling and chromatin remodeling, may also promote homologous recombination by bringing homologous regions closer together [234,235]. Furthermore, negatively supercoiled DNA favors the formation of R-loops with the nascent mRNA, generating a stretch of ssDNA on the non-transcribed strand, which becomes more susceptible to DNA damage and recombination [213].. The collision hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that transcription and replication occurring on the same DNA template can obstruct each other, resulting in stalled or collapsed replication forks that create templates for TAR (Figure 7). A central factor that affects replication progression is the formation of R-loops during transcription (Figure 8) [236]. Since R-loops can impair DNA integrity, multiple mechanisms exist to prevent and resolve R-loop structures: co-transcriptional assembly of RNP particles on the nascent RNA prevents the formation of R-loops from bacteria to metazoans; and the presence of nucleosomes prevents invasion of the RNA strand after passage of the transcription machinery in yeast and higher eukaryotes. In addition, RNA processing factors that assemble at the nascent RNA also prevent the accumulation of R-loops. Thus, mutants defective for these pathways, including transcription elongation [232], RNA splicing [237], and mRNA export [238] display genomic instability and elevated TAR.. . . . 4. Conclusions. Cells have developed a myriad of mechanisms to ensure error-free, stable, and processive DNA replication. These mechanisms include fork protection proteins that stabilize the fork when it stalls, checkpoint pathways that monitor fork stalling and delay cell cycle progression, helicases that remove DNA bound proteins ahead of the fork, and topoisomerases that release torsion and topological entanglements. In this setting, although initially counterintuitive, there are intrinsic regions across the genome that promote fork stalling. These genome regions have a central role in genome stability; however, how they function together with the replisome to promote genome stability is not completely clear. In this review, we aimed at presenting our current understanding of how cells deal with some of the replication obstacles present along the genome. We also intended to provide a clearer view of why these obstacles are retained throughout evolution as they also carry inherent regulatory functions, which we are starting to understand. Future studies are warranted to investigate the molecular function of replication fork blockage and its effects in genome stability and instability. Such investigations at the genome-wide level using multiple organisms may lead us to better understanding of the impact of fork stalling on genome maintenance. They will also help us elucidate how DNA replication and transcription processes are coordinated not only to preserve genome integrity but also to promote genome evolution..
PMC5357732	Introduction. Heterochromatin is a compacted region of eukaryotic chromosomes that is used for various genome regulations, such as chromosome segregation and gene silencing, and RNAi mechanisms play a key role in the assembly of heterochromatin in several eukaryotes (Grewal, 2010, Martienssen and Moazed, 2015). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are produced from repeats at major heterochromatic loci and target the Argonaute protein Ago1 to nascent transcripts from these repeats. This interaction recruits the methyltransferase Clr4, which promotes the accumulation of methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) and its binders, the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) homologs Swi6 and Chp2, thereby establishing heterochromatin (Grewal, 2010). Ago1 and Swi6 also recruit the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and the Dicer protein (Hayashi etal., 2012, Rougemaille etal., 2012, Sugiyama etal., 2005), resulting in the further production of siRNAs, which constitutes a self-reinforcing feedback loop for heterochromatin maintenance. Similar feedback loops are operational in piwi-associated RNA (piRNA)-mediated transcriptional silencing in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, in which the HP1 homolog Rhino promotes the production of piRNAs at the targeted loci (Mohn etal., 2014, Zhang etal., 2014), and in RNA-directed DNA methylation in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, in which DNA methylation and H3K9me cooperate to reinforce the RNAi signal (Pikaard and Mittelsten Scheid, 2014).. Although the RNAi-mediated feedback loop is pivotal for the maintenance of heterochromatin, it must be stalled at heterochromatin borders to avoid abnormal genome regulation (Talbert and Henikoff, 2006). At the centromeres and the silent mating type locus of fission yeast, B-box sequences of tRNA genes prevent the spreading of heterochromatin by recruiting the transcription factor TFIIIC, which tethers the boundaries to the nuclear periphery (Noma etal., 2006, Scott etal., 2007). Similarly, insulator elements establish structural barriers for heterochromatin boundaries in mammals (Cuddapah etal., 2009, Narendra etal., 2015). In contrast, one side of the fission yeast centromere 1 lacks a B-box but contains inverted repeat elements, which show preferential enrichment of a JmjC protein Epe1 known to prevent spreading of heterochromatin into neighboring sequences (Noma etal., 2006, Zofall and Grewal, 2006). This region also expresses a noncoding RNA that evicts Swi6 to prevent heterochromatin spreading (Keller etal., 2013). Therefore, localized activities preventing heterochromatin formation also play important roles in the maintenance of heterochromatin boundaries. RNAi-mediated heterochromatin spreading may also be interrupted by inhibiting the production or action of small RNAs, although such a mode of regulation has not been reported.. RNAi mechanisms underlie the programmed DNA elimination of ciliated protists (Fang etal., 2012, Mochizuki etal., 2002, Sandoval etal., 2014), and an RNAi-heterochromatin feedback loop acts in this process in Tetrahymena thermophila (Noto etal., 2015). Tetrahymena has two distinct nuclei in a single cell: the germline micronucleus (MIC) and the somatic macronucleus (MAC). During the conjugation (sexual reproduction) of Tetrahymena, new MICs and MACs are generated from a zygotic product of the MICs, while the parental MAC is degraded (Figure1A). Then, in the new MAC, 10,000 internal eliminated sequences (IESs), which comprise one-third of the MIC genome and many of which are transposon related, are reproducibly removed (Hamilton etal., 2016). At early conjugation stages (23hr post-mixing [hpm]), 60% of IESs, called type-A IESs, and their genomic surrounding are bi-directionally transcribed in the MIC, and the transcripts are processed to 26- to 32-nt siRNAs called Early-scnRNAs (Malone etal., 2005, Mochizuki and Gorovsky, 2005). Early-scnRNAs are loaded into the Argonaute protein Twi1p and move into the parental MAC, where those complementary to the MAC genome (i.e., non-IES sequences) are degraded (Aronica etal., 2008, Schoeberl etal., 2012). The remaining IES-specific Early-scnRNAs are then shuttled into the developing new MACs (78 hpm) and are believed to base pair with nascent transcripts from type-A and type-B IESs, the latter of which constitute 40% of all IESs and share repetitive sequences with type-A IESs (Noto etal., 2015). These interactions recruit the methyltransferase Ezl1p, which mediates the accumulation of H3K9me, H3K27me, and the HP1-like protein Pdd1p to IESs (Liu etal., 2007). This heterochromatin nucleation induces the production of Late-scnRNAs, additional 26- to 32-nt siRNAs that further promote heterochromatin assembly, and thus form a positive feedback loop (Noto etal., 2015). A heterochromatin-binding endonuclease eventually excises IESs, and their flanks are ligated at 1216 hpm (Cheng etal., 2010, Lin etal., 2012, Vogt and Mochizuki, 2013).. Because heterochromatin is specifically formed on IESs (Kataoka and Mochizuki, 2015) and Late-scnRNAs are exclusively derived from IESs (Noto etal., 2015), some mechanism must inhibit the RNAi-heterochromatin feedback loop at the boundaries of IESs in Tetrahymena. Here, we present genetic evidence for the presence of a mechanism forming precise heterochromatin boundaries at IESs and its importance in accurate DNA elimination in Tetrahymena.. . . Results. . Coi6p Is an HP1-like Protein Associated with Heterochromatin in the New MAC. COI6 is a conjugation-induced (COI) gene that encodes the HP1-like protein Coi6p (Figures S1A and S1B) and is important for DNA elimination (Woehrer etal., 2015). To localize Coi6p, weraised an antibody against recombinant Coi6p. Western blot analysis showed that this antibody recognized a protein migrating at 65kDa that was expressed exclusively at late conjugation stages (816 hpm) in wild-type (WT) cells (Figure1B). This agrees well with the predicted molecular weight of Coi6p (60kDa) and the late conjugation-specific expression of COI6 mRNA (FigureS1C). The protein was not detected in COI6 knockout (KO; COI6) cells (Figure1C), in which all copies of the COI6 gene in both MIC and MAC were disrupted (Woehrer etal., 2015) (FigureS1D). Altogether, we conclude that this antibody specifically recognizes Coi6p.. Immunofluorescent staining using this antibody showed that in the new MACs of WT cells, Coi6p was localized homogeneously at 8 hpm and in foci at 14 hpm (Figure1D). These foci were heterochromatin bodies in which heterochromatinized IESs accumulated because they also contained Pdd1p (Figure1D), the other HP1-like protein that is known to localize in heterochromatin bodies (Kataoka and Mochizuki, 2015, Taverna etal., 2002). Therefore, Coi6p is a component of heterochromatin in the new MAC.. . . Coi6p Accumulates on IESs. We next analyzed the chromosomal localization of Coi6p. At 12 hpm, a stage at which heterochromatin formation is largely completed, but most IESs remain in the new MAC chromosomes, the new MACs were enriched by fluorescence-activated sorting from WT cells and used for ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing) with the anti-Coi6p antibody. The MIC genome (and the new MAC genome prior to DNA elimination) mainly consists of three types of sequences: type-A and type-B IESs and MAC-destined sequences (MDSs) that lie between IESs (Noto etal., 2015). We found that Coi6p accumulated on most of the type-A and type-B IESs in a representative 100-kb MIC locus (Figure1E, left, magenta and blue, respectively). A meta-analysis for the compiled 500bp up- and downstream of the boundaries of type-A and type-B IESs across the genome also showed that Coi6p was enriched on both type-A and type-B IESs (Figure1E, right). ChIP-seq analysis using an anti-Pdd1p antibody (see Figure2G) indicated that Pdd1p, the known heterochromatin component, localized similarly to Coi6p. These results indicate that Coi6p associates with IESs, regardless of their types.. We then asked whether the accumulation of Coi6p on IESs depends on Pdd1p. In the new MAC of PDD1 cells, Coi6p was enriched on type-A IESs, whereas its relative accumulation on type-B IESs was markedly reduced (Figure1F). We previously demonstrated that the DNA elimination of the majority of type-A IESs only requires Early-scnRNAs, which are produced in a Pdd1p-independent manner, whereas the DNA elimination of many type-B IESs requires both Early- and Late-scnRNAs, of which the latter require Pdd1p for their production (Noto etal., 2015). Therefore, the most probable explanation for the above observations is that heterochromatin (or incomplete heterochromatin) on type-A IESs induced by Early-scnRNAs in the absence of Pdd1p is sufficient to recruit Coi6p, whereas such heterochromatin is insufficiently formed on type-B IESs because of a lack of Late-scnRNAs in PDD1 cells. These results indicate that Coi6p is an RNAi-dependent heterochromatin component on IESs.. . . Coi6p Is Important for Confining Heterochromatin toIESs. We next asked whether Coi6p plays a role in the formation of heterochromatin. Immunofluorescent stainings showed that H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and Pdd1p similarly accumulated in the new MACs of WT and COI6 cells at 8 hpm (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2G). However, ChIP-seq analysis at 12 hpm revealed that although H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 accumulated on both type-A and type-B IESs in COI6 cells, they were less enriched compared with WT cells (Figures 2C2F) and were also detected in some MDS regions (arrowheads in Figures 2D and 2F). This redistribution was also visible in the meta-analysis: whereas the localization of H3K9/K27me3 in the WT cells was sharply confined to IESs, it was distributed in a broader fashion in COI6 cells (Figures 2C2F, right).. Consistent with the fact that Pdd1p binds to H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (Liu etal., 2007, Taverna etal., 2002), ChIP-seq analysis revealed that Pdd1p was also redistributed in COI6 cells (Figures 2G and 2H). However, the redistribution of Pdd1p was less prominent than that of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in the absence of Coi6p (cf. Figure2H with 2D and 2F), indicating that the localization of Pdd1p is not merely determined by the presence of H3K9/K27me3, but is also regulated by additional factors, which will be discussed below. Nonetheless, the results above indicate that Coi6p is not required for heterochromatin formation per se but is required for the precise accumulation of heterochromatin components on IESs.. . . Coi6p Is Dispensable for the Biogenesis and Turnover of Early-scnRNAs. Early-scnRNAs are 26- to 32-nt RNAs that are produced from the MIC at early conjugation stages (24.5 hpm) and are continuously present until later stages in WT cells (Noto etal., 2015). Because heterochromatin formation depends on Early-scnRNAs (Liu etal., 2004), we next analyzed Early-scnRNAs in the absence of Coi6p. Small RNAs at different stages of conjugation were sequenced, and 26- to 32-nt RNAs were mapped to compiled IES loci, as with the meta-analysis for ChIP-seq above. As we previously reported (Noto etal., 2015), in WT cells (Figure3, WT), Early-scnRNAs at 3 hpm were mostly derived from type-A IESs and their surrounding MDS regions. At 6 hpm, they mapped more exclusively to type-A IESs (note that fewer RNAs were mapped to the regions marked by arrowheads at 6hpm than at 3 hpm in Figure3) because of scnRNA selection, in which Early-scnRNAs complementary to the parental MAC genome were selectively degraded (Aronica etal., 2008, Schoeberl etal., 2012). In COI6 cells, Early-scnRNA accumulation at 3hpm and the reduction of those mapping to MDS regions by 6hpm occurred normally (Figure3, COI6). We therefore conclude that heterochromatin redistribution in the absence of Coi6p does not occur at the level of Early-scnRNAs.. . . Coi6p Is Important for Confining Late-scnRNA Production to IESs. In addition to Early-scnRNAs, another class of 26- to 32-nt siRNAs called Late-scnRNAs is produced from the new MACs. Because heterochromatin formation and Late-scnRNA production are interdependent (Noto etal., 2015), we next analyzed Late-scnRNAs in COI6 cells. We previously showed that in WT cells, whereas Early-scnRNAs are produced in the parental MIC exclusively from type-A IESs and their surrounding MDS regions at early conjugation (34.5 hpm), Late-scnRNAs are expressed from both type-A and type-B IESs in the new MACs at late conjugation stages (7 hpm or later) (Noto etal., 2015). Therefore, 26- to 32-nt RNAs that map to type-B IESs can be identified as Late-scnRNAs.. As previously shown in WT cells, Late-scnRNAs that map to type-B IESs accumulated after 8 hpm (Figure3, WT, type-B IES, 812 hpm). They were derived almost exclusively from IESs. In contrast, in COI6 cells, Late-scnRNAs from type-B IESs were reduced, but those mapping to their surrounding MDS regions were increased (Figure3, COI6, type-B IES, 812 hpm). MDS-mapped 26- to 32-nt RNAs were also elevated at type-A IES loci in COI6 cells (Figure3, COI6, type-A IES, 812 hpm). Because MDS-mapped Early-scnRNAs around type-A IES mostly disappeared by 6 hpm because of scnRNA selection, the small RNAs from these MDS regions at the later stages in COI6 cells were also Late-scnRNAs. Altogether, we conclude that Coi6p prevents the production of Late-scnRNAs from outside of both type-A and type-B IESs.. An analysis of the small RNA-seq profiles of individual loci in COI6 cells at 12 hpm (Figure2J) revealed that although a largenumber of IES loci produced Late-scnRNA from MDSs (arrowheads in Figure2J), other IES loci were unaffected. Most of the MDS loci that ectopically produced Late-scnRNAs in COI6 cells also ectopically accumulated H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (cf. Figures 2D, 2F, and 2J), suggesting that Coi6p is important for stalling the cis-spreading of heterochromatin and Late-scnRNA production by downregulating the RNAi-heterochromatin feedback loop at a subset of IES borders.. . . Coi6p Interacts with Coi7p and Lia5p. To better understand the function of Coi6p, we aimed to identifyCoi6p-binding proteins. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed in the lysate of WT cells at 8 hpm using the anti-Coi6p antibody. Mass spectrometry analyses detected Coi7p and Lia5p as co-precipitated proteins with Coi6p (Figure4A). Coi7p is an acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32) family protein (FigureS2C) that is encoded by the conjugation-induced gene COI7 (Woehrer etal., 2015). Lia5p is similar to IS4 family transposases but probably lacks endonuclease activity (Shieh and Chalker, 2013).. We raised antibodies against Coi7p and Lia5p whose specificities were verified using COI7 mutant (see below) and LIA5 KO (LIA5) (Shieh and Chalker, 2013) cells, respectively (see Figure5A). Reciprocal IP using these antibodies (Figure4B) showed that Coi7p and Lia5p co-precipitated with Coi6p, whereas only Coi6p co-precipitated with Coi7p, and Coi6p and Coi7p co-precipitated with Lia5p, albeit in low amounts. A yeast two-hybrid assay showed that Coi6p binds to Coi7p, whereas the interaction between Lia5p and the other two proteins was undetectable (Figure4C). These results indicate that Coi6p interacts directly with Coi7p and probably indirectly with Lia5p.. Consistent with the late conjugation-specific expression of COI7 and LIA5 mRNAs (FigureS1C), both Coi7p and Lia5p were detected specifically at late conjugation stages by western blot (Figure4D). ChIP-seq analyses using the anti-Coi7p or anti-Lia5p antibodies showed that, in the new MACs of WT cells at 12 hpm, these proteins were enriched on both type-A and type-B IESs (Figures 4E and 4F). Therefore, Coi7p and Lia5p co-localize with Coi6p on IESs, and thus these three proteins not only interact in cell lysate, but also likely on chromatin.. . . Coi7p Is Necessary for the Stable Accumulation of Coi6p. Even though LIA5 strains have been described (Shieh and Chalker, 2013), no loss-of-function mutant of COI7 has been established. By expressing Cas9 and a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the COI7 open reading frame (ORF) in WT cells, we produced two heterozygous COI7 mutants with different 1-bp deletions in the 14th codon of the COI7 ORF in the MIC, named COI7fs1 and COI7fs2 (Figures S2AS2D). Then, these heterozygous mutants were interbred to generate transheterozygous COI7fs1/fs2 strains in which all copies of COI7 in both MIC and MAC were disrupted (FigureS2A). Coi7p was undetectable in COI7fs1/fs2 cells (Figures 5A and S2E), confirming the complete disruption of COI7 in these cells.. We then investigated whether Coi6p, Coi7p, and Lia5p influence each others stability and localization. Western blot analysis showed that, although the absence of Coi6p or Lia5p did not obviously affect the accumulation of the other proteins, in COI7fs1/fs2 cells, only a small amount of Coi6p accumulated at 8 hpm and became undetectable at later stages (Figure5A). Immunofluorescent stainings showed that none of them were required for the other proteins to localize into the new MAC, although Coi6p was greatly reduced in COI7fs1/fs2 cells (Figures S2FS2H). Therefore, Coi7p is important for the accumulation of Coi6p but is not required for the nuclear localization of Coi6p.. . . Coi7p and Lia5p Are Important for the Precise Production of Late-scnRNAs. We next asked whether any of the Coi6p-binding proteins play a role in Late-scnRNA accumulation. An analysis of small RNAs from COI7fs1/fs2 cells at 10.5 hpm showed that Late-scnRNAs from MDSs were increased at both type-A and type-B IES loci, and that the overall production of Late-scnRNAs from type-B IESs was reduced (Figure5B). These defects were similar to those of COI6 cells (Figure5B) and can be explained by the destabilization of Coi6p in the absence of Coi7p (Figure5A). In contrast, in LIA5 cells, the number of mapped Late-scnRNAs increased on both MDSs and IESs (Figure5B). Therefore, Lia5p negatively regulates Late-scnRNA production in both IESs and MDSs, whereas Coi6p and Coi7p prevent Late-scnRNA production specifically outside of IESs.. We next determined which fractions of IES boundaries are affected by Late-scnRNA production in each mutant (Figure5C). For each boundary, scnRNA reads from 10.5 hpm mapping to the 500-bp MDS region outside of each boundary were divided by those mapping to the 500-bp IES region inside the respective boundary, and this value was normalized by dividing it by the corresponding values from control WT cells at 10.5 hpm to obtain the broken boundary index (BBI). Then, distributions of BBIs were visualized with boxplots. Whereas BBIs in WT cells (biological replicate for the control WT cells) at 10.5 hpm centered at approximately 1 (= no disturbance), the distribution of BBIs shifted to higher values in all of the mutant strains, indicating that a large subset, but not all, of the IES boundaries lost the precision of Late-scnRNA production in the absence of Coi6p, Coi7p, or Lia5p.. To compare the Late-scnRNA production of the different mutants at the single IES locus level, we mapped sequenced scnRNAs of each strain at 10.5 hpm to the 500bp inside and outside of each IES boundary, and the top 50 affected (highest BBI) loci in COI6 cells were chosen to show as heatmaps (Figure5D, top). The heatmap patterns were comparable between COI6 and COI7fs1/fs2 cells, indicating that a similar set of IESs was affected to similar extents in terms of Late-scnRNA production in COI6 and COI7fs1/fs2 cells. Most IESs affected in COI6 cells were also affected in LIA5 cells, although scnRNAs from individual loci were generally increased in LIA5 cells. Collectively, we conclude that Coi6p, Coi7p, and Lia5p are crucial for the precise production of Late-scnRNAs from largely overlapping sets of IESs.. . . Jmj1p May Cooperate with Coi6p to Regulate the RNAi-Heterochromatin Feedback Loop. The H3K9/K27 methyltransferase Ezl1p is required for the production of Late-scnRNAs (Noto etal., 2015). Because the H3K27 demethylase Jmj1p (Chung and Yao, 2012) potentially counteracts Ezl1p, we hypothesized that Coi6p and its binding proteins cooperate with Jmj1p. JMJ1 KO (JMJ1) cells were established by disrupting all copies of JMJ1 in both MIC and MAC (FigureS3A). Accumulations of Coi6p, Coi7p, and Lia5p were not obviously affected in JMJ1 cells (Figure5A). In agreement with the previous ChIP-PCR analysis of H3K27me3 in JMJ1 RNAi-knockdown cells (Chung and Yao, 2012), ChIP-seq analyses of JMJ1 cells showed that H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 were less enriched on both types of IESs than in WT cells and redistributed to MDS regions (Figures S3FS3I). Coi6p was redistributed similarly to H3K9/K27me3 (FigureS3C), but Pdd1p was detected only at a subset of loci at which H3K9/K27me3 was upregulated (FigureS3E) in JMJ1 cells. Therefore, similar to COI6 cells (Figure2), H3K9/K27me3 are redistributed, and some mechanism besides these histone marks helps to confine Pdd1p localization to IESs in the absence of Jmj1p.. We then examined small RNAs in JMJ1 cells and found that Late-scnRNAs were produced ectopically at the loci where ectopic heterochromatic histone marks were also detected (FigureS3K, arrowheads). Late-scnRNA production was similarly affected in JMJ1 and COI6 cells genome-wide (Figure5B), as well as at the individual locus level for both the 50 most affected IES loci in COI6 cells (Figure5D, top) and those in JMJ1 cells (Figure5D, bottom). However, in JMJ1 cells, Late-scnRNA production from MDSs that were distant from IESs was more strongly affected than in COI6 cells (compare regions marked with arrowheads and arrows in Figure5B), suggesting that Jmj1p may act at MDS regions regardless of their distance from IESs. The results above suggest that Jmj1p and Coi6p confine heterochromatin formation and Late-scnRNA production to IESs at a largely overlapping set of IES loci.. . . Coi6p, Coi7p, Lia5p, and Jmj1p Are Important for DNA Elimination. To compare the efficiency of DNA elimination in the different mutants, we harvested cells at 34 hpm and hybridized them with probes complementary to the moderately repeated Tlr1 IESs (Wuitschick etal., 2002) (Figure6A). DNA elimination is completed at 16 hpm in WT cells but is completely blocked in the absence of Pdd1p (Coyne etal., 1999). Consistently, we detected no Tlr1 staining in the new MACs of WT cells and a homogeneous Tlr1 signal in the new MAC from PDD1 cells. As we reported previously (Woehrer etal., 2015), most of the COI6 cells (84%) showed a homogeneous Tlr1 signal in the new MAC, but a significant population (15%) showed a fainter and non-homogeneous hybridization signal in the new MAC (partial in Figure6A), and a small fraction (1%) of the cells even showed no detectable Tlr1 IESs in the new MAC. Similarly, in COI7fs1/fs2 cells, 84%, 15%, and 1% of cells showed homogeneous, partial, and no detectable Tlr1 signal in the new MACs, respectively. In LIA5 cells, 95% and 5% of cells showed a homogeneous and partial Tlr1 signal in new MACs, respectively. In contrast, in JMJ1 cells, the Tlr1 signal in the new MAC was detected only in 18% of cells. Altogether, we conclude that Coi6p, Coi7p, Lia5p, and Jmj1p are important for completing DNA elimination, whereas the phenotypic divergence between COI6/COI7fs1/fs2/LIA5 cells and JMJ1 cells indicates that Jmj1p has distinct functions from the rest of the proteins in DNA elimination.. . . Abnormal DNA Elimination Occurs at the Site of Ectopic Late-scnRNA Production. DNA elimination was severely, but not completely, inhibited in COI6, COI7fs1/fs2, and LIA5 cells, and was only mildly inhibited in JMJ1 cells (Figure6A). Therefore, at least some level of DNA elimination occurred in these mutants. Using these strains, we asked whether the ectopic production of Late-scnRNAs causes ectopic DNA elimination. We chose four genomic loci, each of which continuously produces scnRNAs from MDS regions between two or three consecutive IESs in COI6 cells and determined whether these MDS regions were eliminated together with the neighboring IESs. Primers were designed in MDS regions close the left boundary of the left IES and close to the right boundary of the right IES (Figures 6B6E, right panels, arrows) and were used for PCR with genomic DNA from vegetative cells (before conjugation) and from exconjugants at 24 hpm. In this experimental design, we detected only the MAC loci, but the longer MIC loci were inefficiently amplified. Because not all cells in a culture complete conjugation, the detected MAC loci at 24 hpm could be derived from both the new MAC and the parental MAC.. From WT and PDD1 cells, we detected only the normal MAC loci (Figures 6B6E, Normal MAC, stars) for all of the tested loci. In contrast, from COI6 and COI7fs1/fs2 cells, we detected PCR products corresponding to DNA shorter than the normally rearranged MAC loci in all of the loci (Figures 6B6E, Abnormal MAC, arrowheads). The DNA sequencing of the PCR products from COI6 cells indicated that these indeed lacked the MDS between the IESs (FigureS4). In JMJ1 cells, similar ectopic DNA elimination was detected at two (Figures 6D and 6E) of the four loci, which correlated with the incidence of ectopic Late-scnRNA production at these loci (Figures 6B6E, left panels). In LIA5 cells, we did not detect any such abnormal DNA elimination, likely because of the more severe block of DNA elimination than in the other mutants (Figure6A). Because the ectopic DNA elimination at two of the loci above resulted in the deletion of genes (Figures 6B and 6D) and because there are 10,000 IESs in the MIC genome, many genes could be removed by ectopic DNA elimination in the absence of Coi6p, Coi7p, or Jmj1p. Altogether, the results above suggest that the precise production of Late-scnRNAs from IESs is important for generating a functional somatic genome.. . . . Discussion. In this study, we demonstrated that the HP1-like protein Coi6p, Coi6p-interacting proteins Coi7p and Lia5p, and the H3K27 demethylase Jmj1p are crucial for many IESs to confine the production of Late-scnRNAs and the formation of heterochromatin to IESs. The presence of these boundary-protecting factors indicates the existence of active mechanisms that define the borders of IESs at the level of heterochromatin in Tetrahymena by counteracting the positive feedback loop between RNAi and heterochromatin, thus preventing the redistribution of the RNAi signal and heterochromatin into neighboring genomic regions. Because the loss of Coi6p, Coi7p, or Jmj1p caused abnormal DNA elimination, the proper formation of heterochromatin boundaries is required for the integrity of the somatic genome.. Previous studies (Liu etal., 2007, Noto etal., 2015, Taverna etal., 2002) have indicated that the RNAi-heterochromatin positive feedback loop in DNA elimination consists of the following steps (Figure6F, left): (1) the Early-scnRNA-Twi1p complex recruits the histone methyltransferase Ezl1p to IESs in the new MAC; (2) Ezl1p catalyzes H3K9me3 and H3K27me3; (3) H3K9/K27me recruits the HP1-like protein Pdd1p; (4) Pdd1p induces the biogenesis of Late-scnRNAs in cis; and (5) Late-scnRNA-Twi1p/Twi11p complexes further recruit Ezl1p. In this study, we found that, at some IES borders, the loss of the boundary-protecting factors caused the redistribution of Late-scnRNA and H3K9/K27me3 without a severe redistribution of Pdd1p (Figures 2 and S3), despite the necessity of Pdd1p for the accumulation of Late-scnRNAs (Noto etal., 2015). This observation indicates that Pdd1p can act at long distances beyond the IES borders to induce Late-scnRNA production, which we suggest to be inhibited at three different levels in WT cells (Figure6F, right): (1) at Late-scnRNA biogenesis, in which Coi6p and its associated factors are possibly involved; (2) at H3K9/K27me3 accumulation, at which Jmj1p may act by turning over H3K9/K27me3 either genome-wide or specifically at IES boundaries; and (3) at Pdd1p accumulation, at which a yet unknown factor prevents Pdd1p from being localized to MDSs even in the advent of H3K9/K27me3 redistribution in the absence of the boundary-protecting factors.. Coi6p and its binding partners were distributed across the whole body of IESs according to our ChIP-seq analyses (Figures 1E, 4E, and 4F). Therefore, it is puzzling that they have a specialized function at IES boundaries. Although the loss of Coi6p or Coi7p resulted in abnormal DNA elimination (Figures 6B6E), it also severely blocked DNA elimination (Figure6A). The latter is probably not simply caused by the disturbance of heterochromatin borders because although we observed a similar degree of heterochromatin and Late-scnRNA spreading in COI6 and JMJ1 cells, DNA elimination was only mildly inhibited in JMJ1 cells (Figure6A). Coi6p and its binding partners may play a dual role in promoting DNA elimination at the body of IESs and inhibiting heterochromatin spreading at the borders. In S.pombe, Swi6 resides in the bodies of heterochromatin domains and recruits the JmjC domain-containing protein Epe1. Loss of Swi6 or Epe1 causes spreading of H3K9me (Stunnenberg etal., 2015, Zofall and Grewal, 2006). Therefore, two opposing chromatin-modifying activities both reside in heterochromatin to confine heterochromatin at proper loci in fission yeast. Our study suggests that the two HP1-like proteins Pdd1p and Coi6p are recruited to IESs in Tetrahymena and have opposing activities for heterochromatin assembly. Like Epe1, Jmj1p is a JmjC domain-containing protein. Jmj1p might be recruited to heterochromatin by Coi6p to negatively regulate heterochromatin spreading.. Coi7p belongs to the ANP32 protein family (FigureS2C), some members of which have been implicated as histone chaperones (Reilly etal., 2014). Coi7p might also be a histone chaperone thatregulates histone dynamics. Alternatively, because Coi7p directly binds to and stabilizes Coi6p (Figures 4 and 5A), it might be a Coi6p chaperone that controls the localization of Coi6p. Compared with the Coi6p-Coi7p interaction, the association of Lia5p with Coi6p was less robust (Figures 4A4C). Consistently, the phenotype of LIA5 cells diverged from that of COI6 and COI7fs1/fs2 cells with a more severe DNA elimination block (Figure6A), no detectable ectopic DNA elimination (Figures 6B6E), and Late-scnRNA upregulation from both MDSs and IESs (Figure5B). Lia5p probably inhibits the RNAi-heterochromatin feedback loop at both the bodies and the borders of IESs, and the Coi6p-Coi7p complex may enhance its activity at the borders.. In terms of spreading Late-scnRNAs and heterochromatin, not all IESs were affected in the absence of the boundary-protecting factors, and even the two boundaries of each IES seemed to act independently (Figures 2 and S3). We so far have failed to identify any features explaining the vulnerability of each boundary to the spreading event induced by the loss of the boundary-protecting factors. A few IESs are known to be associated with cis-acting elements that influence their excision boundaries (Carle etal., 2016, Chalker etal., 1999, Godiska etal., 1993). The heterochromatin borders of distinct sets of IES boundaries might also bedefined by different sets of cis-acting elements, and the identified boundary protecting factors may be functionally associated with only a subset of such elements. If this is the case, IESs that are not affected by the loss of identified factors may beregulated by another mechanism. Several HP1-like proteins in addition to Pdd1p and Coi6p are encoded in theTetrahymena genome, and some of them might have a boundary-protecting function similar to Coi6p, but at different sets of IES boundaries.. . . Experimental Procedures. . Tetrahymena Strains and Culture Conditions. The WT strains B2086 and CU428 were obtained from the Tetrahymena Stock Center. COI6 and LIA5 strains were described previously (Shieh and Chalker, 2013, Woehrer etal., 2015). Other strains are described below. Cells were grown at 30C in super proteose peptone (SPP) medium (Gorovsky etal., 1975) to a concentration of 5 105 cells/mL, washed with 10mM Tris (pH7.5), starved for 824hr at 30C, and mating was induced by mixing equal numbers of cells with different mating types at 30C.. . . Antibodies. Rabbit anti-Coi6p, anti-Coi7p, and anti-Lia5p antibodies were raised against respective full-length recombinant proteins and purified with Protein A. Guinea pig anti-Pdd1p antibody was described previously (Kataoka and Mochizuki, 2015). Rabbit anti-Pdd1p antibody (ab5338) and mouse anti-alpha-tubulin antibody 12G10 were obtained from Abcam and Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, respectively.. . . DNA Elimination Assays. Fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISH) was performed as previously described (Kataoka and Mochizuki, 2015). For PCR analyses, total genomic DNA and the primers listed in Table S1 were used. Products were purified from the gel, cloned, and >20 clones for each product were sequenced.. . . ChIP-Seq and Small RNA-Seq. ChIP-seq was performed as previously described (Kataoka and Mochizuki, 2015). The reads were mapped on individual genomic loci with 100-bp bins or compiled 500bp inside and outside of each boundary of 3,715 type-A and 2,863 type-B IESs with 10-bp bins. The number of ChIP-seq reads was divided by that of input reads. Small RNA-seq was performed as previously described (Noto etal., 2015). The position of the 5 end of each RNA read was mapped to 100-kb genomic loci (bin size, 100bp). For the meta-analysis, which compiled results for 500bp inside and outside of each boundary of 3,722 type-A and 2,863 type-B IESs, and for the heatmap visualization of scnRNA expression, the position of the 13th nt of each scnRNA was mapped in 10-bp or 50-bp bins, respectively. To obtain the BBI, the number of RNA reads that mapped the 500-bp MDS region outside each boundary was divided by the number used to map the 500-bp IES region inside the boundary, and this value was normalized by dividing by the corresponding values obtained from WT cells.. . . Identification of Coi6p-Associated Proteins. WT cells were harvested at 8 hpm and suspended in 1 IP buffer (20mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100mM NaCl, 2mM MgCl2), including 2 Protease Inhibit Cocktail (without EDTA) (Roche) and 0.5mM PMSF. The cells were lysed by sonication, PMSF was further added to 1mM, and insoluble material was removed by a 20min centrifugation at 17,000 g and stored at 80C. The lysate from 5 107 cells was incubated with 250L of Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen) cross-linked with either pre-immune serum or the anti-Coi6p antibody for 2hr and then washed 3 for 5min with 10mL and 6 for 1min with 1mL of IP buffer. Proteins were eluted in 100L of 0.1M glycine HCl (pH 2) for 10min at 25C, neutralized by adding 10L of 1M Tris (pH 9), trypsin-digested, and analyzed by mass spectrometry.. . . Protein-Protein Interaction Analyses.

In addition, 1mM PMSF was further supplemented after thawing the lysate. Then, 1mL of cell lysate was incubated with Dynabeads cross-linked with immune or pre-immune serum for 2hr at 4C and washed 4 for 5min with 1mL of IP buffer. The proteins were eluted in 35L of 0.1M glycine (pH 2) for 10min at 25C, and 1/10 vol of 0.75M Tris (pH 9) and 1.25M NaCl were added. Procedures for yeast two-hybrid assays are in the Supplemental Information.. . . Production of COI7 Mutant and JMJ1 KO Strains. pBNMB1-HA-Cas9Tti-U6gRNA-COI7T1 (see Supplementary Information) was digested with XhoI and introduced to the MAC BTU1 locus of CU428 cells using a biolistic gun. Transformants were assorted until they grew in 10mg/mL paromomycin, Cas9 expression was induced in 1g/mL CdCl2 for 5hr, and the cells were washed and incubated overnight in 10mM Tris (pH 7.5). Then, the cells were mated with B2086 strain, single mating pairs were isolated, and progeny were selected in 15g/mL 6-methylpurine. The COI7 locus was amplified by PCR and sequenced to identify mutations. Two heterozygous strains were crossed to generate transheterozygous COI7 mutant strains. The JMJ1 KO construct was made by fusing 1.3 kb of the 5 flanking region, a neo3 cassette, and 1.3 kb of the 3 flanking region.

PMC5349086	Introduction. Resin embedding has been widely applied in light and electron microscopy analysis of biological samples (Newman et al., 1949; Mikula et al., 2012; Mikula and Denk, 2015). This technique hardens tissue to facilitate ultra-thin sectioning. Combined with optical imaging techniques, we can acquire optical images of tissue and then reconstruct the three-dimensional morphology of neurons in a whole brain at a sub-micron axial resolution (Li et al., 2010; Quan et al., 2016). Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be used to label specific proteins and subcellular compartments in vivo, which facilitates the study of many aspects of neuroscience (Tsien, 1998; Feng et al., 2000; Oh et al., 2014). Unfortunately, the procedure for dehydration and resin embedding weakens the fluorescent signals of GFP (Becker et al., 2012; Ragan et al., 2012), making the signals difficult to detect.. In recent years, many improvements have been made in the procedure for biological tissue embedding, such as cryofixation, dehydration, and embedding at low temperatures (Jorgensen and McGuffee, 1987; Luby-Phelps et al., 2003; Micheva and Smith, 2007; Nixon et al., 2009; Watanabe et al., 2011; Peddie et al., 2014). Until now, many methods were only used in cell or small tissue block studies, and it is not certain whether GFP fluorescence is well-preserved in the tissue using these methods. Other methods preserve the fluorescent signal to some extent by adjusting the pH value of the resin (Watanabe et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2013), but this approach greatly affects the resin polymerization and reduces the quality of cutting. Although the methods mentioned above allow for the detection of GFP signals, because fluorescence quenching still exists, researchers do not believe that it is feasible for GFP to be applied in resin embedding technology (Ragan et al., 2012). Therefore, it is still a challenge to improve the brightness of the fluorescent protein in a large volume of resin-embedded tissue.. To solve these problems, our lab systematically studied the mechanism of GFP molecule quenching in acrylic resin (Xiong et al., 2014). We found that GFP molecules are transformed into a non-fluorescent state because of the protonation of the GFP chromophore during resin embedding rather than by direct denaturation in acrylic resin. Under an alkaline environment, the protonated chromophore of GFP can be transformed into an anionic state, which results in the recovery of GFP fluorescence molecules in resin-embedded tissue because the GFP recovers its fluorescent state through the permeation of alkaline solutions (over a pH range of 912) (Figure 1). According to this mechanism, we propose a principle of chemical reactivation (CR) that can greatly enhance the fluorescence intensity of GFP and YFP in resin-embedded biological tissue.. . Figure 1. . The principle reaction of chemical reactivation for fluorescence imaging.

Scale bars: (B,C), 20  20  50 m3; (D), 2 m.. . . . The whole brain sample preparations involve multiple steps and demands stringent specification. Improper operation of any step may cause a decrease of sample quality or even failure. Sample preparation with stably quality and high efficiency requires a detailed and standard protocol to guide experimental operation. In this study, we provide a detailed protocol for resin embedding of a whole brain and the CR of fluorescent protein. This protocol includes two parts: the complete procedure for whole brain embedding and chemical reactivation of the fluorescent signal in resin-embedded tissue (Figure 2). This protocol can be employed to prepare biological tissue for good ultrathin section cutting, and to observe the fine structures of neural cells under a light microscope. This approach was used in our previous publication (Xiong et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2016), and in this article, we provide an optimized version of the procedure. Compared with our previous version, this procedure prevents the fluorescence reduction caused by treatment with complete dehydration and largely preserves the neural details labeled by GFP/YFP. This procedure is now a standard protocol in our lab.. . Figure 2. . Schematic diagram for the entire experimental procedure. (A) Schematic diagram illustrating the procedure for embedding whole mouse brains and chemically reactivating the quenched fluorescence. (B) Flowchart for the all steps of the protocol.. . . . . Applications and advantages of the method. In CR, the fluorescence signal of biological tissue can be greatly enhanced, even for ultrathin (70200 nm) section from an HM20-embedded tissue. Therefore, the resin-embedding method is compatible with GFP and its variants fluorescence labeling techniques. This protocol can be applied for resin-embedding of biological tissue and well preserves the fluorescence signal and structure of the biological tissue. This protocol is compatible with many fluorescence imaging techniques, such as wide-field epifluorescence, confocal, and two-photon microscopy. The fine structures of neurons, such as the filopodium and axon terminal boutons, can be clearly observed in the resin-embedded brain through light microscopy. Combined with imaging and slicing, this protocol can be used to acquire full three-dimensional morphological structures of specifically labeled cell in a large volume of biological tissue. The resin-embedded sample can be preserved long-term, and its fluorescent signal can be maintained under 20C and dark conditions for more than 2 year. This protocol can be applied to resin-embedded samples labeled by GFP, YFP, and GFP mutant strains. However, chemical activation has no obvious effect on embedded samples labeled with red fluorescent protein (mCherry and DsRed, etc.) or fluorescent dye (Alexa 647 and CY5, etc.) because they are not sensitive to protonation.. . . . Experimental design. . Sample selection. To ensure a better imaging result, the brain samples should be well-labeled either through a transgenic technique or virus labeling. If the fluorescent signal of the sample is too weak, it will reduce the imaging quality. before processing, the sample should be examined with a fluorescence microscope by a quick glimpse.. . . Fixation. For histology, the purpose of fixation is to stabilize the in vivo tissue structure and protect it from the deleterious effects of dehydration, infiltration and embedding (Oliver and Jamur, 2010). Aldehyde fixatives can preserve the morphology and structure of cells (Schnell et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012). In the screening experiments, we found that 2.5% glutaraldehyde enhanced the autofluorescence compared to 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in tissue. The autofluorescence can reduce the contrast of the images because the autofluorescence emission spectra overlap with GFP signals in brain tissue. Meanwhile, Add sucrose in PFA solution will help to maintain cell shape (Kusser and Randall, 2003). The possible reason is that the fixation process may result in partial water loss of tissue, which induce uneven shrinkage and deformation of the cell. Therefore, from our previous experience, we added 2.5% sucrose in 4% PFA solution to fix the brain tissue.. Fixation can be divided into cardiac perfusion fixation (step 3) and post-fixation (step 5). After perfusion fixation, the brain has certain hardness and can be more easily peeled away. Post-fixation can further increase the hardness of the brain, reduce cell autolysis and maintain cell structure (Paavilainen et al., 2010). In this process, the time and temperature will affect the fluorescence signal of the brain tissue. If the fixation time is too short, the brain will have serious deformations during the latter process of dehydration and resin embedding. In contrast, if the fixation time is too long, the fluorescence signals will be quenched and the autofluorescence in the tissue will be enhanced. A suitable fixation time for the whole mouse brain is 24 h at 4C in the dark.. . . Rinsing. Residual fixative can be removed by rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline. Therefore, complete rinsing can reduce the autofluorescence caused by PFA of a resin-embedded brain. Rinsing can enhance the contrast of the images, especially when detecting weak fluorescent labeling signals during imaging.. . . Dehydration. Generally speaking, resin cannot directly penetrate biological tissue because biological tissue contains a large quantity of water, and resin is not soluble with water at any proportion (Newman and Hobot, 2012). To force the resin to infiltrate the tissue, we required organic solvents that are miscible with resin and water to remove water from the tissue. Through tissue dehydration, water is removed from the tissue by adding increasing concentrations of organic solvent. Then, the resin can evenly infiltrate the internal tissue (Echlin, 2009). Acetone and ethanol are typical dehydrating agents (McDonald, 2014). In our process, acetone dehydration was faster than ethanol dehydration, and there was no difference between the solutions in fluorescence preservation. However, because oxygen and acetone can hinder acrylic resin polymerization (Suvarna et al., 2013), acetone results in incomplete or a lack of polymerization in acrylic resin (Watanabe and Jorgensen, 2012). Thus, we chose ethanol as the gradient dehydrating agent for whole mouse brains. Additionally, the temperature at which dehydration is performed is very important for fluorescence preservation. Through testing, we found that fluorescence could be preserved well in ethanol at 4C. However, the fluorescence was irreversibly quenched by ethanol at room temperature (25C; Figure 3). At a temperature of 4C, dehydration times were set depending on the size of the sample. For example, dehydration of a whole mouse brain requires 12 h, while dehydration of half a brain requires only 6 h.. . Figure 3. . The influence of dehydrating temperature on CR-induced fluorescence recovery. (A) thy1-YFP H mouse brain was divided into the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere. The left and right hemispheres were dehydrated at 25 and 4C, respectively, and then embedded in resin. After embedding, the same coronal plane area was revealed and immersed in 0.05 M Na2CO3 solution for 1 h. (A) Fluorescence brightness of the left hemisphere. (B) Fluorescence brightness of the right hemisphere. (A,B) Two regions of a single brain. The inset images in (A,B) show the same coronal plane area, and the green box indicates (A,B). (C) The normalized fluorescence intensities were comparable for the samples dehydrated at 25 and 4C (mean  SD; *p < 0.01 in two-tailed T-test; n = 32 each). Scale bars: (A,B), 100 m; (A,B), green box, 0.5 mm.. . . . . . Selection of resin types. For embedding fluorescence-labeled tissue, many characteristics of embedding agents should be considered, including autofluorescence, viscosity, hydrophilic-hydrophobic properties, polymerization type, mechanical properties, and other factors. Epoxy resin has a good cutting performance, whereas it is difficult for epoxy to penetrate tissue because of its high viscosity. Acrylic resin has a low viscosity, can easily penetrate tissue and has low autofluorescence, which can be optimal for optical imaging. Furthermore, acrylic resin is also superior to epoxy resin for fluorescence preservation.. Acrylic resin materials were divided either into hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups according to their hydroxyl groups or into cross-linking and non-cross-linking groups according to their double functional groups. Hydrophilic resin, such as Lowicryl K4M, GMA, or LR White resin, can tolerate a small amount of water in polymerization, at a mass ratio of ~1012% (Newman and Hobot, 2012). For polymerization of hydrophobic resins, such as MMA, Lowicryl HM20, and Lowicryl HM23, the tissue must be completely dehydrated (Newman and Hobot, 1999); otherwise, it is very difficult for the resin to evenly penetrate tissue. Cross-linking resins, such as Lowicryl K4M, LR White, and Lowicryl HM20, have very good cutting performance and can produce nanoscale sections of tissue. In the sectioning process, the slice is not curly and is easier to collect than those obtained with non-cross-linking resin. In contrast, the cutting performance of non-cross-linking resins, such as GMA and MMA, is poor. In addition, when cutting ultrathin sections, the tissue can easily break loose from the surrounding resin.. Lowicryl HM20 resin, with its low viscosity, can quickly complete penetration into a large volume of biological tissue. At the same time, its low autofluorescence and its ability to preserve ultrastructure will ensure imaging quality (Nanguneri et al., 2012). Taking all of these advantages into account, we chose HM20 resin as the embedding medium for our protocol.. . . Resin permeability and polymerization. The infiltration time for a sample depends on the sample size, resin viscosity, and temperature. At 4C, the rate of resin infiltration is greater compared to temperatures below zero. Through testing, we found that the complete infiltration time for a mouse brain is ~3 days.. Polymerization methods for acrylic resin include heat polymerization, catalytic polymerization, and UV polymerization. Because it is difficult for UV light to penetrate thick tissue, UV polymerization is typically used when embedding small volumes of tissue (Newman and Hobot, 1999). Catalytic polymerization is very easily inhibited by oxygen and often causes incomplete polymerization of the resin, and in our study, the results were not consistent. Therefore, catalytic polymerization and UV polymerization were not suitable for embedding tissue at a large volume (Schwarz and Humbel, 2007). Heat polymerization at 50C to 60C produced reproducible results when benzoyl peroxide (BPO) was used as an initiator. However, we found that the fluorescence was quenched substantially at temperatures above 55C. If the polymerization were performed in a vacuum environment, the sample could be completely polymerized at 50C.. . . Chemical reactivation. Based on the previous test results, we found that CR could be applied to many types of acrylic resins, such as LR white, GMA, Technovit 9100, and Lowicryl HM20. For hydrophilic embedding media (LR White and GMA), 2 min of alkaline liquor penetration can enhance fluorescence in a 9-m-thick layer, but the penetrated layer was only 4 m thick when using a hydrophobic medium (Technovit 9100 and Lowicryl HM20). In theory, basic chemical molecules or ion groups which hydrolyze hydroxyl ions can produce a chemical activation effect for resin-embedded tissue labeled by GFP, YFP, or other GFP mutants. The basic chemical molecule or ion group will hydrolyze hydroxyl ions, which then activate the fluorescence of GFP. Typical basic solutions have pH values in the range of 912, such as sodium hydroxide solution, ammonia solution, and ethylene diamine solution (Xiong et al., 2014). We used 0.05 M Na2CO3 as an alkaline buffer solution because it is less abrasive, non-toxic and non-irritating to the human body.. . . . Materials. . Tissue.

For example, for 50% ethanol solutions, add 1 volume absolute ethyl alcohol to 1 volume distilled water in a centrifuge tube. Screw the lid on tightly and shake the container for a few minutes. Prepare other graded ethanol solutions and label the tubes clearly.. . . . Pre-infiltration. . Lowicryl HM20 kits. Lowicryl HM20 kits include three components: monomer mixtures-E, cross-linker-D, and a photo-initiator-C. The photo-initiator was not used to initiate polymerization in this protocol. The monomer mixture-E and cross-linker-D consisted of monomethyl ether hydroquinone (MEHQ), which is used as a polymerization inhibitor. This inhibitor can quench GFP and GFP-variant fluorescence, inhibit initiator decomposition generating free radicals, and affect the quality of resin polymerization. CRITICAL: The filtered Lowicryl HM20 kit should be stored at 4C in the dark.. . . . Filtered resin monomer mixtures and cross-linker. Place a small amount of cotton wool into a chromatography column outlet. The chromatography column should be filled with 3/4 aluminum oxide powder. Then, fix the column on a retort stand and add the resin monomer mixtures. Seal the plug and let nitrogen pass through the chromatography column slowly to destabilize the monomer mixtures. A column filling with Al2O3 can destabilize 500 g of monomer mixtures. Place the destabilized monomer mixture in a sealable brown glass bottle and store the mixture at 4C. Filter and store the cross-linker according to the following steps. Label the tube clearly. ! CAUTION: Lowicryl HM20 kits contain irritants and toxic components and can cause allergies. Avoid inhalation or direct exposure to skin or eyes. Wear nitrile gloves, a mask and goggles to handle all components of the Lowicryl HM20 resin in a fume hood.. . . Resin working solution. Weigh 0.2 g of BPO, 33 g of monomer mixture and 7 g of cross-linker and place in 60 ml sealable brown glass bottles. Add a magnetic stir bar and gently stir for 10 min or by bubbling dry nitrogen into a resin solution until the BPO completely dissolves. Screw the lid on tightly and keep the bottle sealed. Label the bottle clearly and store it at 4C. CRITICAL: BPO particles can slowly decompose at room temperature. The bottle should be sealed and stored at 8C. When preparing working solutions, BPO should be added prior to the monomer mixture and cross-linker to prevent BPO particles from sticking to the wall of the bottle. The stirring time should not be long to prevent excess oxygen from incorporating into the resin. Seal the bottle and prevent exposure to aqueous vapor when stored at 4C. Oxygen and aqueous vapor will affect resin polymerization. ! CAUTION: BPO is an irritant, is toxic, and can cause allergies. Avoid inhalation or direct exposure to skin or eyes. Wear nitrile gloves, a mask and goggles when handling BPO and all components of the Lowicryl HM20 resin in a fume hood.. . . Pre-infiltration solutions. Prepare 1:1 and 2:1 (vol/vol) resin pre-infiltration solutions in absolute ethanol. For example, for a 1:1 resin pre-infiltration solution, add 1 volume resin working solution to 1 volume absolute ethanol in a sealable brown glass bottle. Screw the lid on tightly and shake it gently. Prepare the 2:1 resin pre-infiltration solution according to the following steps. Label the bottle clearly and store it at 4C. CRITICAL: This solution cannot be used repeatedly, and avoid long-term storage. !

The quality and fluorescent signals of resin-embedded samples can be examined when the resin has polymerized. After the resin polymerization, there should be no air bubbles in the sample. If the rate of resin polymerization is too high, bubbles will form in the resin (see Supplementary Figures 1A,B), and the samples may become brittle. Rapid polymerization causes poor cutting performance. When a cavity appears in the center of a sample, it indicates that the brain was not completely dehydrated or infiltrated (see Supplementary Figures 1C,D). However, if the cavity is only located in a ventricle, it means that air has perfused into a ventricle during the procedure of cardiac perfusion because air will hinder the infiltration of resin into the ventricle (Supplementary Figure 2).. The dehydration temperature is critical for fluorescence preservation, and dehydration at room temperature can cause irreversible fluorescence quenching. Through testing, we found that brains can be rapidly dehydrated at 4C with good fluorescence preservation (Figure 4). Whole-brain embedding involves the processes of fixation, dehydration, and embedding. Problems with any of the steps discussed above can lead to a morphological distortion of the neurons. If all procedures are strictly followed, one possible reason for problems is that the mouse was too young (<4 weeks) or the PFA perfusion rate was too high. For immature mice, the PFA perfusion rate should be adjusted to 4 ml/min.. An alkali solution can rapidly penetrate resin-embedded tissue and rapidly enhance GFP/YFP fluorescence (Supplementary Video 1). For the hydrophobic HM20 resin-embedded brains, 2 min of penetration can enhance ~4 m of the fluorescence layer. This approach can fully activate 1 m of the fluorescence layer below the surface in 2 min (Figures 1EG). For ultrathin (70200 nm) section from an HM20-embedded brain, this approach can still greatly enhance fluorescence (Figure 5).. . Figure 5. .

This protocol well preserves the fluorescence signal and neural details of the whole mouse brain (Figure 6), it can be used for various optical micro-imaging technologies.

The fine structures of neurons, such as spines, boutons, and the junction points of dendrites and axons, can be observed using confocal microscopy (Figure 8). Using two-photon fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (2 P-fMOST) system, we can acquire high-resolution imaging data sets of the whole brain (Figure 9).

PMC5348765	Background. Retrotransposons are copy-and-paste mobile elements transferred via an RNA intermediate through the process of reverse transcription. Generally, retrotransposons are further subdivided in two major groups: long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs), with their viral descendants (retroviruses), and non-LTR retrotransposons (non-LTR-RTs). The only general structural feature shared between autonomous elements from both groups is the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain, a key enzyme responsible for reverse transcription. In contrast, the set of other encoded activities could largely vary and rely on the life cycle organization and insertion strategy of the retrotransposon [13]. Each of these additional domains can have an evolutionary history independent from that of the RT domain. There are multiple examples of independent acquisitions of domains with the same enzymatic activity by the diverse retrotransposons, suggesting the importance of the domain-encoded function for the performance of each element [410]. One of these examples is the ribonuclease H (RNH) domain, which has been captured by diverse retrotransposons on different occasions [46, 8, 1114].. RNH activity is required for the removal of an RNA template from a cDNA/RNA hybrid generated during reverse transcription. Retrotransposons rely on either the host genome-encoded RNH enzyme or encode their own RNH domains [4]. For example, non-LTR-RTs often rely on host genome-encoded RNH activity, as the reverse transcription of these transposons occurs directly in the nucleus where the host cellular RNH enzyme is naturally present [4, 15]. Nevertheless, some non-LTR-RTs encode their own RNH. For example, some non-LTR-RTs of oomycetes and plants have acquired RNH closely related to the Archaea-like RNHs (aRNH). Interestingly, these two groups of non-LTR-RTs independently acquired aRNHs [6, 11]. In case of the LTR-RTs, the presence of the element-encoded RNH is obligatory, as reverse transcription occurs in the cytoplasm where no host-encoded enzyme is available [4]. Accordingly, the RNH domain has been detected in all LTR-RTs, and the evolution of the domains follows that of the RT [5]. However, some retroelements, such as retroviruses, have captured additional RNH domains, resulting in a dual RNH [4, 5, 16]. Strikingly similar to retroviruses, the Tat LTR-RTs of green plants have acquired an additional RNH domain, aRNH, indicating structural and functional convergence between plant Tat LTR-RTs and vertebrate retroviruses [5].. In the present study, we mined all aRNH-containing retrotransposons from oomycete genomes and provided new examples of convergence in retrotransposons between plants and oomycetes. We identified and characterized two groups of Ty3/Gypsy LTR-RTs, Chronos and Archon, and a subgroup of L1 non-LTR-RTs in the genomes of oomycetes, which to our knowledge has not previously been described. These retrotransposons captured aRNH in the same manner as plant retrotransposons. In addition, we showed that Chronos LTR-RTs also captured a chromodomain (CHD), resembling the evolution of plant Chromoviruses and Ty1/Copia CoDi-I LTR-RTs from the free-living Stramenopiles Phaeodactylum tricornutum [7, 1719].. . . Results. . Diversity of aRNH-containing retrotransposons in oomycete genomes. aRNH is a subgroup of the type I RNH, which also includes Fungi/Metazoa-like RNHs (fmRNH) and LTR-RT RNH. While fmRNHs and aRNHs are characterized by the presence of histidine or arginine residues respectively in the active site, LTR-RTs RNHs lack any conserved residues in that position [4, 16]. aRNHs were originally described in the archaeal genomes and were also identified as cellular genes in the genomes of plants and some bacteria [20]. Furthermore, RNH domains that were found in Ty3/Gypsy Tat LTR-RTs and Ta11 L1 non-LTR-RTs of higher plants [1214] were shown to be phylogenetically related to cellular-like aRNHs [5, 6]. In addition, Kojima and Jurka [11] identified a subgroup of aRNH-containing non-LTR-RTs of the Utopia group in oomycete genomes.. To determine the presence of the aRNH in other retroelements, we screened for aRNH sequences in Repbase Update (RU, v. 20.08), the database of eukaryotic transposable elements [21, 22]. Consistent with previous data, all retrotransposons predicted to have an aRNH domain (see Methods for details) were detected in either the genomes of higher plants or the parasitic protozoans oomycetes. Surprisingly, in addition to the previously described Utopia non-LTR-RTs [11], some oomycete Ty3/Gypsy LTR-RTs and L1 non-LTR-RTs also encode aRNH (for the RU accession numbers see Additional file 1: Table S1).. Since the variability of the oomycete retrotransposons annotated and deposited in RU 20.08 was restricted only to retrotransposons from seven species, of which retrotransposons from only four species contained aRNH (Additional file 1: Table S1), to provide comprehensive insight into the diversity of the identified elements, we further analyzed oomycete genomic sequences for the presence of aRNH-containing retrotransposons. This mining resulted in an overall set of 2899 distinct retrotransposon sequences from 21 out of 25 analyzed oomycete genomes. We initially classified the identified elements into the three groups, Ty3/Gypsy, L1 and Utopia, based on homology to the ORF2 amino acid sequences of aRNH-containing retrotransposons identified in RU. When possible, full-length copies were retrieved as representatives for each genome, and their structure and domain composition were analyzed (Fig.1a, Additional file 1: Table S2).Fig. 1Diversity of aRNH-containing retrotransposons in oomycetes. a Schematic structural composition of the elements from the identified groups: ORFs are shown as horizontal ovals (ORFs 1 are shaded); PR  protease; gRH  RNH of Ty3/Gypsy LTR-RTs; aRH  aRNH (in red); IN  integrase; CHD  chromodomain (in blue); EN  apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-like endonuclease, RLE  restriction-like endonuclease; CCHC Zn finger motif indicated as vertical gray line; gray arrows, LTRs  long terminal repeats. b Consensus of Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian trees based on the amino acid sequences of RT domain of LTR-RTs.

The complete Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic trees with accession numbers, the names of the elements, and all the statistical support values are presented in Additional file 2: Figure S1. . Based on the RT phylogeny and comparative structural analysis, we identified two groups of aRNH-containing Ty3/Gypsy LTR-RTs in oomycetes. The first group, designated here as Archon, is specific for Saprolegniales genomes, and its members have an aRNH next to the original Ty3/Gypsy RNH domain. Interestingly, this RNH-aRNH junction resembles the dual RNH domains of Tat LTR-RTs and retroviruses [5]. The second group, named Chronos, comprises elements detected in the Peronosporales and Pythiales genomes. In addition, a single copy of a Chronos element was identified in Aphanomyces astaci (Saprolegniales). These retrotransposons also have dual RNH domains. However, in contrast to all other known aRNH-containing elements, these transposons possess a CHD in the 3 end of their pol next to the INT domain (Fig.1b, Additional file 2: Figure S1, Additional file 1: Table S2). Previously, the presence of a CHD was shown only for two groups of LTR-RTs: Chromoviruses (a group of Ty3/Gypsy LTR-RTs [7, 9, 18, 23]) and CoDi-I elements (a group of Ty1/Copia LTR-RTs from the free-living Stramenopiles, pennate diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum [17]). Although Archon and Chronos LTR-RTs share similar structural organization with Tat LTR-RTs and Chromoviruses, they seem to be only distantly related to these elements (Fig.1b, Additional file 2: Figure S1).. Identified in most of the Peronosporales and Pythiales genomes and undetectable in the Saprolegniales genomes (Additional file 1: Table S2), oomycete aRNH-containing L1 elements are similar in general organization to aRNH-containing Ta11 L1 of plants (Fig.1c). In both groups, the aRNH domain is positioned at the C-terminal end of ORF2. Notably, both groups are also characterized by a CCHC cysteine motif located upstream of the aRNH. In other non-LTR-RTs harboring an RNH, the CCHC is positioned downstream of the RNH in ORF2 [24]. However, despite the similarities in the general organization of ORF2 (Fig.1c, Additional file 3: Figure S2), oomycete and plant L1s do not form a monophyletic clade within the L1 group.. Oomycete Utopia elements were identified in most Peronosporales and Pythiales genomes, while only one copy was detected in Saprolegnia diclina (Saprolegniales) (Additional file 1: Table S2). Utopia is one of the old clades of non-LTR-RTs (such as R2, R5, and CRE) and its elements have sequence-specific restriction-like endonuclease domain (RLE), which guides their insertion to U2 small nuclear RNA genes [11]. The Utopia elements identified in our study did not differ in organization from the original Utopias identified by Kojima and Jurka [11] (Fig.1c, Additional file 3: Figure S2).. The distinct positions of the oomycete Chronos, Archon, L1, and Utopia groups on the RT phylogenetic trees from all previously known aRNH-containing retrotransposons and from each other suggested that aRNH was independently acquired by each of these groups. However, to further elaborate on this idea, we performed a comparative analysis of the aRNHs from genomes of oomycetes, plants and other organisms.. . . Diversity of aRNH in oomycetes. After screening the oomycete genomic sequences, we detected aRNHs that were not associated with RT (individual aRNHs) and could therefore represent potential cellular genes. To obtain reference cellular RNH sequences, we additionally screened for fmRNHs using a set of sequences from a previous study [5]. Table1 summarizes the results of the analysis comparing the distribution of individual aRNHs and fmRNHs to that of the RT-associated aRNH domains. We identified individual aRNHs in 21 out of 25 oomycete genomes. Notably, we previously identified aRNH-containing retrotransposons in these same 21 genomes. In contrast, fmRNH was identified in all studied genomes. For a majority of the genomes there was only single copy of an individual aRNH, while other genomes contained up to eleven copies of an individual aRNH. The copy number of fmRNHs per genome was also relatively low, varying from one to seven (Table1), suggesting that due to its ubiquity and low copy number, fmRNH is the most likely candidate for the cellular RNH gene in oomycetes. However, the functions and origins of the individual aRNHs in oomycetes remain elusive.Table 1Diversity, distribution, and the number of aRNH and fmRNH domains in the studied oomycete speciesTaxonomic position according to the NCBI taxonomyRT-associated RNHs numberIndividual RNHs numberOrderFamilyGenusSpeciesChronosArchonL1UtopiaaRNHfmRNHaRNH 1aRNH 2aRNH 3AlbuginalesAlbuginaceae.

To unveil the origin of both RT-associated aRNHs and individual aRNHs in oomycetes we performed a comparative analysis of RNH genes and domains from various sources (Figs.2 and 3, Additional file 4: Figure S3, Table1). L1, Archon, Chronos, and Utopia oomycete aRNH domains and aRNHs of plant retrotransposons form distinct clades on the tree (Fig.2). The identified individual aRNHs were split into three clades on the tree: aRNH 1, aRNH 2, and aRNH 3. Two clades, aRNH 1 and aRNH 3, clustered together with the aRNH domains from oomycete retrotransposons Archon and L1, respectively, although this clustering was not supported by the bootstrap. aRNH 2 formed a distinct clade that did not show any significant clustering with any RT-associated aRNHs (Fig.2, Additional file 4: Figure S3). Notably, multiple copies of both aRNH 1 and aRNH 3 were detected in the studied oomycete genomes (Table1). Thus, together with the potential relationship between the two aRNH groups and the RT-associated aRNHs of oomycetes, these results may suggest that aRNH 1 and aRNH 3 may represent remnants of Archon and L1 retrotransposons. In contrast, aRNH 2 was not related to RT-associated aRNHs (Fig.2, Additional file 4: Figure S3). Therefore, it is likely that aRNH 2, in addition to fmRNH, could be a cellular RNH gene in oomycetes. This finding is also supported by the wide distribution and low copy number of aRNH 2 (Table1).Fig. 2Maximum-likelihood representative tree based on the amino acid sequences of different types of type I RNHs. Approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) statistical support values (unit fractions) are shown at the corresponding nodes of the tree; the values are highlighted in red if the corresponding node was additionally supported by more than 60 of 100 bootstrap replicates.

To shed more light on the evolution of both aRNH and fmRNH in oomycetes, we mined aRNH and fmRNH homologs from the free-living Stramenopiles taxa, the closest relatives of oomycetes available in databases (Additional file 1: Table S3) using a tBLASTn search against NCBI WGS and TSA databases with oomycete aRNH and fmRNH amino acid domain sequences as queries (Fig.2, Additional file 4: Figure S3) [25]. The results revealed aRNHs in the Stramenopiles genomes but did not detect fmRNHs (Additional file 1: Table S3). The aRNH domains of free-living Stramenopiles form a monophyletic clade on the Maximum-likelihood RNH tree (only weakly supported by the bootstrap) and a paraphyletic clade on the Bayesian tree. In addition, these RNH sequences did not show any significant clustering with other studied aRNHs (Additional file 4: Figure S3).. . . . Discussion. . Potential origin of aRNH and fmRNH in oomycetes. While searching for homologs of aRNH and fmRNH in oomycete genomes, we identified aRNH in both free-living Stramenopiles and oomycete taxa, while fmRNH was detected only in oomycetes (Table1). In addition, aRNH is absent in some groups of oomycetes, likely reflecting its loss in small genome parasitic lineages, such as Albuginales [26]. One possibility is that aRNH was present in the ancestor of the Stramenopiles lineage and was vertically transmitted to oomycetes. Alternatively, aRNH might have been horizontally transferred from green plants, onto which most of the oomycete taxa examined in the present study typically parasitize [25, 27, 28]. The lack of aRNH in some oomycete genomes can be explained by the redundancy of aRNH and fmRNH functions.. The lack of fmRNH in the free-living Stramenopiles most likely indicates that oomycetes acquired this gene after the divergence from the Stramenopiles stem. The horizontal transfer of genes from fungi to oomycetes as an adaptation to parasitism on algae and plants has been previously proposed [27, 28]. Fungal genomes encode fmRNHs, which are responsible for the precise removal of RNA primers of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and are critical for the maintenance of genome integrity (Fig.2, Additional file 4: Figure S3) [29, 30]. Thus, it could be hypothesized that oomycetes might have acquired fmRNH through horizontal transfer together with other genes from ancient fungal lineages. However, in our phylogenetic reconstruction oomycete fmRNHs are only distantly related to fungal fmRNHs, which contradicts this hypothesis (Additional file 4: Figure S3).. . . Convergence between oomycete and plant retrotransposons. In the present study we showed that based on RT phylogeny, the identified aRNH-containing oomycete L1 non-LTR-RTs, and Chronos and Archon LTR-RTs are only distantly related to the previously described aRNH-containing Ta11 L1 non-LTR-RTs and Tat LTR-RTs of green plants (Fig.1, Additional file 2: Figure S1, and Additional file 3: Figure S2). The distinct phylogenetic positions of the elements contradict the possibility of a single origin of all aRNH-containing LTR and non-LTR retroelement from plants and oomycetes. We therefore suggest that presence of aRNH in Tat, Chronos, and Archon LTR-RTs and Ta11 L1 and oomycete L1 non-LTR-RTs could be the best explained by series of independent aRNH acquisitions by ancestors of these elements, reflecting their convergent evolution to the similar structural compositions. However, the single origin of all aRNH-containing LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons from plants and oomycetes could not be completely rejected by the phylogenetic reconstructions due to the low bootstrap support values (in contrast to the aLRT and Bayesian posterior probabilities supports) that we obtained for the paraphyletic origin of the aRNH-containing retrotransposons (Fig.1, Additional file 2: Figure S1, and Additional file 3: Figure S2), leaving the alternative to convergent evolution still open for discussion.. The repeated sequestration and fixation of some functional domains during the evolution by diverse members of a certain genetic lineage may reflect a beneficial effect on the selection in the environment that this lineage inhabits. Previously, we proposed that the dual RNH domains of plant Tat LTR-RTs reflected convergent evolution with vertebrate retroviruses [5]. With the discovery of Chronos and Archon LTR-RTs in oomycetes, dual RNH acquisition may indicate a more general evolutionary tendency in all LTR-RTs. Indeed, the loss of the conserved catalytic residues (D-E-D-R/H-D) in the original Ty3/Gypsy RNH domain and their complete set in aRNH of Chronos and Archon representatives (Fig.3) is similar to what was shown for Tat LTR-RTs [5], and resembles transformation of the original retroviral RNH to the connection (tether) RNH domain after the acquisition of new eukaryotic fmRNH in retroviruses [16] that is supported by the structural study of Ty3 reverse transcriptase [31]. Intriguingly, this evolutionary pathway may resemble an early stage in the transition of a Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon into a retrovirus, preceding the acquisition of the infection-mediating envelope domain.. The beneficial effect from the RNH acquisition for non-LTR-RTs, however, is still poorly understood, as these elements typically rely on the host-encoded RNH activity. Furthermore, RNH could also be lost within some non-LTR-RT groups [32]. The finding of multiple examples of RNH acquisition in non-LTR-RTs therefore remains enigmatic.. The structural analysis of Chronos LTR-RTs revealed that apart from the aRNH domain, these elements also harbor CHD on the C-terminal end of the ORF2 next to the INT domain (INT-CHD), similar to the Ty3/Gypsy Chromoviruses from plants, fungi, and vertebrates [7, 9, 18, 19, 33]. Based on RT phylogeny, we showed that Chronos LTR-RTs and Chromoviruses are evolutionarily distinct from each other, thereby suggesting the convergent acquisition of the CHD by both groups. Interestingly, apart from Chromoviruses and Chronos LTR-RTs the INT-CHD domain was also reported for phylogenetically distant Ty1/Copia CoDi-I elements observed in the free-living Stramenopiles, pennate diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum [17]. See Additional file 5: Figure S4 for the multiple sequence alignment of CHDs from Chronos, Chromoviruses, and CoDI-I LTR-RTs. CHDs are widespread domains involved in chromatin remodeling in eukaryotes [34, 35]. The fusion of the CHD to the INT in LTR-RTs likely targets retrotransposon integration to the heterochromatin away from gene-rich regions [36]. Thus, multiple acquisitions of the CHD reflect the evolutionary tendency in LTR-RTs to minimize the damage to the host, while quietly hitchhiking its cellular machinery for retrotransposon propagation within the genome.. . . . Conclusions. The current understanding of the diversity of retrotransposons and other mobile elements increases with an increasing number of sequenced genomes from a broad taxa range. In the present study, we identified and characterized several groups of retrotransposons from oomycete genomes, which to our knowledge has not previously been described. Importantly, the similar patterns of acquisitions of aRNH and CHD by unrelated retrotransposon groups from oomycetes and plants suggest that these events may represent a major evolutionary trend in retroelement evolution. This trend is likely independent of the retrotransposon host genome and may reflect similarities in the fundamental organization of retrotransposon life cycle, suggesting a beneficial role for the acquired domains in this cycle.. . . Methods. . Computational mining for aRNH-containing repeats in Repbase update. The complete database of prototypic repetitive sequences Repbase Update (RU, v. 20.08) [21] was downloaded and analyzed for the presence of aRNH-containing repeats. Based on a hidden Markov model profile (HMM profile), aRNH domains were mapped using hmmsearch tool of the HMMER package [37] in translations of the retrieved RU sequences. The HMM profile was constructed from the amino acid alignment of aRNH sequences from the Ustyantsev et al. [5]. Repeats without the predicted similarity to aRNH were filtered out. The remained RU repeats were initially grouped according to the taxon of origin and subsequently grouped according to repeat type.. . . Computational mining for aRNH-containing retrotransposons, individual aRNH and fmRNH domains in oomycete genomes. The oomycete genomic sequences used in the present study were retrieved from public databases, as listed in Additional file 1: Table S2. To identify all retrotransposons harboring aRNH, the following algorithm was implemented using the UGENE workflow designer [38]. First, based on the aRNH HMM profile, aRNH domains were mapped using the hmmsearch tool of the HMMER [37] package in translations of the genomic DNA sequences. Second, sequences surrounding the regions of significant similarity to the aRNH profile were expanded, when possible, to 10,000 bp in both directions. Third, the enlarged sequences were screened for the presence of significant similarity to RT domains of non-LTR-RTs and LTR-RTs HMM profiles using hmmsearch. The non-LTR-RTs HMM profile was generated from the RT alignment of Repbase [21] non-LTR-RTs amino acid sequences available in the RTclass1 [12] server output. The corresponding HMM profile for LTR-RTs was constructed from the RT alignment of LTR-RTs amino acid sequences available in Gypsy Database [39]. Fourth, RT-positive sequences were divided into two groups corresponding to either non-LTR-RTs or LTR-RTs, and RT-negative sequences were filtered out, and identified aRNH sequences were retained for a further separate analysis as individual aRNHs. For each dataset, representative sequences were retrieved, and the number of elements belonging to each group (Ty3/Gypsy, L1, and Utopia) was counted by repeated BLAST [40], using ORF2 amino acid sequences of the previously identified RU aRNH-containing retrotransposons of oomycetes (Gypsy_18_PIT_I Ty3/Gypsy LTR-RT, L1-5_PI L1 non-LTR-RT, and R2I-1_PI Utopia non-LTR-RT) as seeding quires in the tBLASTn search.. Fungi/Metazoa RNHs (fmRNH) were mined using the HMM profile reconstructed based on the alignment of fmRNH amino acid sequences from Ustyantsev et al. [5] with hmmsearch, and the flanking sequences were expanded 1,000 bp in both directions.. . . Characterization of the structural composition of aRNH-containing retrotransposons. For each of the identified representative retrotransposons, a detailed analysis of the structural composition was performed. We used NCBI ORFfinder [41] to identify ORFs and NCBI CD-search [42] and HHpred [43] for a subsequent homology-based mining of conserved retrotransposon-specific domains. For LTR-RT representatives, when possible, the sequences of their LTRs were predicted by aligning 5 upstream and 3 downstream sequences flanking ORF1 and ORF2 using BLAST [40]. Secondary structure prediction for Chronos-1_PInfe aRNH was performed using Quick2D from the MPI bioinformatics toolkit [44].. . . Comparative and phylogenetic analysis. The RT amino acid sequences of the LTR-RT and non-LTR-RT representatives were aligned using hmmalign tool from the HMMER package to the corresponding HMM profiles [37]. The amino acid sequences of RNH are less conservative than RT, and a profile multiple alignment with the predicted local structures and 3D constraints (PROMALS3D) server was used to produce the alignment [45]. The alignments (refer to Additional files 6, 7, and 8 for corresponding LTR-RTs RT, non-LTR-RTs RT, and RNH alignments) were manually curated, and the phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the maximum-likelihood and Bayesian algorithms implemented in the PhyML [46] and MrBayes [47] program tools. The best model for phylogenetic reconstruction, LG + G, was suggested using the ProtTest stand-alone tool [48] based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for each of the alignments. In PhyML, an optimal tree topology was searched among 100 random starting trees under the subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) algorithm, from which the tree with the largest log-likelihood value was taken, and its robustness was estimated using a Bayesian-like transformation of approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT, aBayes) and 100 bootstrap replicates [49]. In MrBayes, 10 split Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were run for 2,500,000 generations with sampling each 250 generations and discarding the first 5000 samples prior to consensus tree estimation..
PMC5352658	Introduction. Although, resource allocation by heterotrophs has been studied extensively, the extent to which their behavioral responses is manipulated by pathogens/parasites reflects the fine-tuned evolutionary adaptation in nature (Roy and Raguso, 1997; Ebbert and Nault, 2001; Eigenbrode et al., 2002; Hurd, 2003; Maris et al., 2004; Belliure et al., 2005; Lacroix et al., 2005; Lefvre et al., 2006; Mauck et al., 2010; Bosque-Prez and Eigenbrode, 2011). The choice of plant hosts for oviposition by insects remains an important research area in entomology and ecology (Bernays and Chapman, 1994; Schoonhoven et al., 2005; Tilmon, 2008). For insects, the preference-performance hypothesis (PPH) suggests that females will maximize their fitness by laying their eggs on plant types on which their offspring will perform best (Gripenberg et al., 2010). This hypothesis, also known as the optimal, oviposition theory (Jaenike, 1978), the naive adaptionist theory (Courtney and Kibota, 1990), or the mother knows best principle (Valladares and Lawton, 1991), was originally proposed by Jaenike (1978). Some studies testing female oviposition preferences and larval performance have established positive correlations between females and their offsprings (Craig et al., 1989; Heisswolf et al., 2005; Staley et al., 2009). Other studies, however, showed that mothers could make poor oviposition decisions, leading to a weak preferenceperformance relationship between female adults and offsprings (Rausher, 1979; Scheirs et al., 2004; Digweed, 2006; Gripenberg et al., 2007). These bad motherhood cases have caused extensive debates (Mayhew, 2001; Gripenberg et al., 2010). Alternative hypotheses include optimal foraging (Scheirs et al., 2000), enemy-free space (Denno et al., 1990), and insect neural capacity (Bernays, 2001).. The current study concerns the effects of virus infection of host plants on herbivorous insects. The influences of virus-infected host plants on herbivorous insects can be neutral (Matsuura and Hoshino, 2009), beneficial (Maris et al., 2004; Belliure et al., 2005), or deleterious (Rubinstein and Czosnek, 1997) depending on the specific combination of herbivore, virus, and plant. In addition, viruses can affect plant-derived volatiles such that herbivorous insects are repelled (van Molken et al., 2012) or attracted (Srinivasan et al., 2006; Ngumbi et al., 2007). These manipulations can strongly influence rates of virus transmission and thus have important implications for ecology, human health, and agriculture (Hurd, 2003; Lefvre et al., 2006, 2009). Although, host choice by insects has been continually studied, the influences of virus infection of host plants on host choice by vector and non-vector insects are not well-understood.. Datura stramonium L. (Solanaceae), one of the hosts included in the current study, is a summer weed that originated in the Americas and that has a worldwide distribution (Holm et al., 1997). D. stramonium is also a host for many plant viruses, including Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) (Cohen and Nitzany, 1966) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) (Moyer, 1999). TSWV (genus Tospovirus, family Bunyaviridae) infects and causes disease in hundreds of plant species, including many ornamentals and vegetables (Moyer, 1999). TSWV is transmitted in a propagative and circulative manner by thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae; Ullman et al., 1992).. The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemesia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is a vector of Begomoviruses but not for TSWV. Although, there has been much debate about whether B. tabaci is a species complex or complex of species (Perring, 2001; Brown, 2010; Dinsdale et al., 2010; De Barro et al., 2011), the most current molecular evidence reveals that B. tabaci actually includes at least 24 genetically distinct but morphologically indistinguishable cryptic species (De Barro et al., 2011). The most damaging and widespread cryptic species are the Mediterranean genetic group (biotype Q) and the East-Minor Asia 1 genetic group (biotype B). In a field survey conducted in 2012, we observed B. tabaci Q outbreaks on TSWV-infected plants in several provinces of China, although B. tabaci Q is not a vector of TSWV. Previous study has demonstrated that TSWV infection can decrease B. tabaci Q performance on pepper (Pan et al., 2013). TYLCV infection, in contrast, increases B. tabaci Q (vector) attraction and performance on its host, D. stramonium (Chen et al., 2013).. Previous research examining virus effects on plant-insect interactions has focused primarily on vectors, whereas the effects of virus-infected plants on non-vectors have been largely overlooked (Su et al., 2016). In this study, we investigated the effects of TSWV infection on a non-vector B. tabaci Q. The outbreaks of B. tabaci Q were occurred on TSWV-infected pepper even though the performance of this non-vector was compromised. In addition, we test the volatiles released by TYLCV- and TSWV-infested D. stramonium. We hypothesized that both viruses induce similar changes in volatiles emitted by D. stramonium to make B. tabaci Q select virus-infested D. stramonium.. . . Results. . B. tabaci Q settling and oviposition preferences on TSWV-infected vs. healthy D. stramonium. Significantly more B. tabaci Q adults settled on TSWV-infected than on healthy D. stramonium [One-way ANOVA, F(1, 22) = 91.147, P < 0.001; Figure 1A]. Similarly, B. tabaci Q adults deposited significantly more eggs on TSWV-infected than on healthy D. stramonium [One-way ANOVA, F(1, 22) = 114.406, P < 0.001; Figure 1B].. . Figure 1. .

Settling and oviposition were significantly greater on the TSWV-infected plants than on the healthy plants (P < 0.05).. . . . . . Life history traits of B. tabaci Q on TSWV-infected and healthy D. stramonium. Although, TSWV-infected D. stramonium did not affect B. tabaci Q developmental time [One-way ANOVA, F(1, 22) = 2.599, P = 0.124; Figure 2A], it indeed decreased female body length [One-way ANOVA, F(1, 98) = 20.295, P < 0.001; Figure 2B], male body length [One-way ANOVA, F(1, 98) = 21.322, P < 0.001; Figure 2C], survival rate (egg-to-adult) [One-way ANOVA, F(1, 22) = 6.615, P = 0.019; Figure 2D], longevity [One-way ANOVA, F(1, 58) = 12.570, P < 0.001; Figure 2E], and fecundity [One-way ANOVA, F(1, 58) = 25.502, P < 0.001; Figure 2F].. .

Settling and oviposition were significantly greater on the TSWV-infected plants than on the healthy plants. Within each panel, different letters indicate significant differences between treatments (P < 0.05).. . . . . . Volatiles from TYLCV-infected, TSWV-infected, and healthy D. stramonium. The most significant different volatiles emitted by D. stramonium were o-xylene, -pinene, phenol, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. The quantities of o-xylene, -pinene, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol collected differed significantly in virus-infected vs. healthy plants (Table 1). TYLCV-infested plants released significantly more phenol than healthy plants or TSWV-infected plants. None of the other volatiles detected differed between these three groups. TYLCV-infected plants and TSWV-infected plants released significantly more 2-ethyl-1-hexanol than healthy plants. Concentrations of four volatiles in paroline (XiLong, China) were used to test the preference of white flies: o-xylene (1:500,000), -pinene (1:1,000,000), phenol (1:2,500), and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (1:2,500; Table 1).. .

The retention time of the internal standard, n-octane, was 7.294 min. The four compounds used in the subsequent behavioral assays, including o-xylene, -pinene, phenol, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, were compared with their respective authentic standards (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).. . Different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05).. . . . . Behavioral responses of B. tabaci Q to volatiles emitted from D. stramonium. In dual-choice assays, the proportion of B. tabaci Q adults that selected o-xylene or -pinene was significantly less than the controls (T-test, T = 7.17, df = 19, P < 0.001 for o-xylene; T-test, T = 4.10, df = 19, P < 0.001 for -pinene), suggesting that adults were repelled by these two chemicals (Figure 4). Healthy plants emitted a greater quantity of these volatiles than virus-infected plants (Table 1). The adults were significantly attracted to phenol (T-test, T = 6.55, df = 19, P < 0.001), and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (T-test, T = 10.37, df = 19, P < 0.001), respectively (Figure 4). Virus-infected plants, in general, released a greater quantity of these volatiles than the healthy plants (Table 1).. . Figure 4. . Bemisia tabaci Q choice test with volatiles from D. stramonium. Y-tube olfactometer test documented the percentage of B. tabaci Q females that selected D. stramonium volatiles, including o-xylene, -pinene, phenol, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, over the paroline control, respectively. Values are means  SE (One-sample t-test). Asterisks indicate significant differences (P < 0.05).. . . . . . B. tabaci Q free-choice bioassay with semiochemicals. To examine the correlation between the four semiochemicals and B. tabaci behavior, we assayed host preference using commercially available pure compounds. The selected pure components were administered on paper cards to D. stramonium plants (as described above). Two time points (10 and 20 min) were tested in this experiment. The number of recaptured B. tabaci on each of the two D. stramonium plants did not deviate significantly (Figure 5; the time point selection refers to Bleeker et al., 2009). However, when applied 50 l of o-xylene or -pinene solution onto the paper cards, D. stramonium became significantly more repellent to the whiteflies compared to the controls (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.001; Figure 5). Specifically, D. stramonium with o-xylene and -pinene repelled 97 and 112 whiteflies, respectively, whereas a mixture of both deterred 131 whiteflies (Figure 5). In contrary, the addition of phenol or 2-ethyl-1-hexanol rendered D. stramonium significantly more attractive to the whiteflies (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.001; Figure 5). Phenol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and their mixture attracted 103, 59, and 119 whiteflies, respectively (Figure 5).. . Figure 5. . Bemisia tabaci Q free-choice bioassay with volatiles from D. stramonium. Number of adults that settled on plants after 20 min. Values are means  SE (One-way ANOVA). Asterisks indicate significant differences (P < 0.05).. . . . . . . Discussion. We found that TSWV infection of D. stramonium increased the settling and oviposition of the non-vector B. tabaci Q on D. stramonium even though some of its life history traits were reduced. These results coupled with a previous study (Chen et al., 2013) indicate that virus-infection may, in some cases, cause females to select hosts that do not necessarily maximize their performances. The host selection may depend on the by-products of host infection by the virus. We further tested the hypothesis using peppers, and again found that the non-vector B. tabaci Q elected to settle and oviposit on virus-infected pepper. Similarily, B. tabaci Q preferred TSWV-infected over healthy peppers, even though TSWV decreased Q performance (Pan et al., 2013). Our results also demonstrated that four volatiles released from TYLCV-infected and TSWV-infected plants (o-xylene, -pinene, phenol, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) can repel or attract B. tabaci Q in ways that are consistent with the effects of virus infection on host behavior (Figures 4, 5). In other words, virus-infected plants tended to release greater quantities of volatiles to attract B. tabaci Q adults, while healthy plants tended to release greater quantities of volatiles to fend off B. tabaci Q adults.. From an evolutionary viewpoint, we expect females to maximize their fitness by laying eggs on plants that maximize offspring's fitness (Gripenberg et al., 2010). However, these expectations may or may not be realized on virus-infected plants. In our previous study, B. tabaci Q preferred to settle and oviposit on TYLCV-infected rather than on healthy D. stramonium and had greater fitness when feeding on TYLCV-infected D. stramonium, suggesting an indirect mutualism between B. tabaci Q and TYLCV (Chen et al., 2013). Similar phenomenon has been documented in other insect-virus systems (Montllor and Gildow, 1986; Castle and Berger, 1993; Jimnez-Martnez et al., 2004a; Srinivasan et al., 2006; Ngumbi et al., 2007). In our case, B. tabaci Q preferred virus-infected D. stramonium, however, the overall performance of whiteflies on TSWV-infected plants was reduced. Although, we did not examine other traits, including female cost for oviposition or offspring protection from natural enemies, which also contribute to insect fitness, our results demonstrate a deviation from the mother-knows-best hypothesis. Under the ecological and evolutionary context, we speculate that the apparent loss for B. tabaci, a non-vector of TSWV, represents a gain for TSWV. By reducing the fitness/performance of B. tabaci, the insect vector for many other plant viruses, the transmission of competing pathogens will be compromised, which means a limited or no sharing of host plants for TSWV.. Mauck et al. (2012) suggested that vectors prefer to settle on plants infected with persistently transmitted (PT) viruses, while non-persistently transmitted (NPT) viruses generally have no effect on vector settling and feeding or cause infected plants to be less attractive than healthy plants. Mauck and his colleagues believe that PT viruses typically enhance host plant quality for vector herbivores, resulting in enhanced vector herbivore fitness. NPT viruses, in contrast, often decrease or have no effect on host plant quality (Mauck et al., 2012). For example, pepper plants infected with TSWV increased the survival and oviposition of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae (Belliure et al., 2010). The growth of Spodoptera exigua caterpillars was accelerated on tomato plants infected with Tobacco mosaic virus (Thaler et al., 2010). Our previous study showed the enhanced B. tabaci performance on TYLCV-infected D. stramonium (Chen et al., 2013). In this study, however, we demonstrated that quality of the virus-infected plants might not be the deciding factor for B. tabaci to choose the host plants.. To test whether our results applied to other hosts, we determined whether TSWV infection affected B. tabaci Q settling (Figure 3A) and oviposition (Figure 3B) on pepper. The results with pepper were the same as those with D. stramonium in terms of settling and oviposition preferences. Consistent with our finding, several previous studies indicated that Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) significantly decreases host quality (the aphid Myzus persicae and Aphis gossypii performed poorly on infected host plants) but enhances the attractiveness of infected host plants to aphids (Mauck et al., 2010). We suggest that regardless of how virus infection influences insect fitness, both vector and non-vector insects may prefer to settle and oviposit on virus-infected plants rather than on healthy plants, i.e., both vectors and non-vectors may be manipulated by viruses. Although, the ecological relevance of such manipulation of non-vectors is unknown, we speculate that these non-vector insects might be victimized by the co-evolution between viruses and their vectors due to the shared chemical signatures emitted by the virus-infect plants.. Our results also suggest that the preference of B. tabaci Q for virus-infected plants may be mediated by virus-induced changes in plant volatile emissions. Virus-induced effects on plant odor cues are the induction of specific chemical emissions by plant pathogens (Anderson and May, 1991; Jimnez-Martnez et al., 2004b). For example, enhanced preference of sandflies to hamsters who infected with Leishmania was attributed to changes in host-derived odor cues (O'Shea et al., 2002), and it is considered that volatiles also might explain a study result that the children from western Kenyan harboring the gametocytes (the stage transmissible to mosquitoes) of the Plasmodium falciparum attracted strongly more Anopheles gambiae than uninfected children or those harboring the asexual (non-infective) stage of the parasite (Lacroix et al., 2005). The pathogen causing Dutch elm disease has been revealed to up-regulate volatiles that attract vectors Hylurgopinus rufipes to infected host trees (McLeod et al., 2005). van Molken and his colleagues found that virus infection reduces the attractiveness of host plants for a non-vector insect (van Molken et al., 2012), suggesting the ecological benefits of virus infection for host plants by inducing insect repellence. Our results, however, showed that virus infection attracted a non-vector insect to the host plant. Additional experiments are warranted to resolve this discrepancy.. In summary, this study provides empirical evidences showing that virus-infection increases insect settling and oviposition but reduces insect performance; the long-term evolutionary consequences of these effects are unclear. Specifically, the preference for virus-infected plants in B. tabaci is correlated with an increase in phenol and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and a decrease in o-xylene, -pinene, within the volatile profile emitted by D. stramonium plants. As a non-vector of TSWV, however, insect performance seems to be impaired since adult body size, longevity, survival, and fecundity diminished in TSWV infected D stramonium plants.. Nevertheless, other factors may affect host selection as well. Trichome plays an important role in the host selection process, ovipositional behavior, and larval performance (Shanower et al., 1999; Mayhew, 2001; Handley et al., 2005). Trichomes and their exudates can reduce the efficiency of natural enemies and thus may have negative or positive influences on insect herbivory insect populations (Blaney and Simmonds, 1990). Besides there are four major groups of defensive compounds in plants that impact insect performance (Schoonhoven et al., 1998), including phenolics (e.g., polyacetates, tannins, and lignins), terpenoids (e.g., cardenolides and terpenes), cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates, and nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., non-protein amino acids and alkaloids). These compounds can have both direct and indirect influences on the performance of herbivorous insects (Awmack and Leather, 2002). TSWV infection may induce changes in trichome traits or the release of defensive compounds in host plants, which warrants further investigation.. . . Materials and methods. . Bemisia tabaci Q laboratory population. The B. tabaci Q used in this study was originally collected from a poinsettia plant in Beijing, China, in 2009 and it has been maintained on poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima Wild. ex Klotz.) in insect-proof cages at 26  2C with a 12/12 h light/dark photoperiod. The identity of whitefly cryptic species was confirmed by cleavage amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I genes (mtCOI; Chu et al., 2010).. . . Plant cultures and TSWV inoculation. D. stramonium L. and pepper (Capsicum annuum L., cv Zhongjiao 6) plants were grown as described previously (Chen et al., 2013). TSWV was maintained on D. stramonium. The virus inoculum on D. stramonium and pepper plants were done as described by Pan et al. (2013). Infection was then confirmed for inoculated and non-inoculated control plants by ELISA as described by Chen et al. (2013). When these plants grew to the seven true-leaf stage, they were used in the experiments.. . . Bemisia tabaci Q settling and oviposition on healthy vs. TSWV-infected plants. Experiments concerning whitefly settling and oviposition preference were performed as described by Chen et al. (2013). There were 12 replicate cages for each combination of plant species and virus status (infected), with insects and plants drawn from the same pool. These replicates were distributed over time and independent. The replicate cages were simultaneously arranged with each side exposed to natural lighting in a greenhouse at 26  2C. Individual plants of healthy and TSWV-infected D. stramonium or pepper were arranged in opposite corners of the cage. Approximately 300 adult B. tabaci Q were released in the centerbottom of each cage.. . . Bemisia tabaci Q life history traits on healthy vs. TSWV-infected D. stramonium. Experiments concerning life history traits of whitefly were performed as described by Chen et al. (2013). The development time, female body length, male body length, survival, longevity of newly emerged adults and fecundity were evaluated in these experiments.. . . Extraction and analysis of volatiles emitted by TYLCV-infected, TSWV-infected, or healthy D. stramonium. Experiments concerning volatiles were extracted and analyzed as described by Wei et al. (2007). Volatiles emitted from uninfested plants and plants that have been infested by TYLCV or TSWV were collected using a headspace collection system in a climate room equipped with high-intensity sodium-halide lights (temperature 24  2C; RH 6070%). The soil containing the roots of each plant was carefully wrapped in aluminum foil, and the plant was placed individually in a 2.5-L glass jar with a gas inlet and a gas outlet. Each of the three treatments was represented by five replicate plants. Before air (78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% carbon dioxide) was pumped into each glass jar through the inlet, it was purified through a gas purge system. A glass tube filled with 100 mg of PoraPak Q (80/100-mesh; Waters, USA) was used to trap plant volatiles at the outlet. After 4 h collection under continuous light, volatiles were eluted from the PoraPak Q with 800 L of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade methylene chloride (Tedia Company, Fairfield, Ohio, USA), and samples received 10 L of an internal standard (20 ng/L of n-octane) used for quantifying relative compound amounts. Then a 1-L sample of the solution was subjected to gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-2010 Shimadzu, Japan). The system was equipped with Agilent Technologies capillary column DB-5MS (30 m  0.25 mm ID  0.25 m film thickness).. For analyses using the Agilent Technologies capillary column, the initial oven temperature was kept at 40C for 4 min and then increased to 180C at a programmed rate of 5C min1, followed by a rate of 10C min1 to 230C. On a DB-5MS column (30 m  0.25 mm ID  0.25 m film thickness), the GC oven temperature was kept at 40C for 4 min and then increased to 200C at a rate of 5C min1, followed by a rate at 20C min1 to 280C. The inlet was operated under the splitless injection mode, and the injector temperature was maintained at 250C with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL min1. The GC-MS electron impact source was operated in the scan mode with the MS source temperature at 230C and the MS Quad at 150C. Compounds were identified by comparison of retention time and mass spectra (NIST database and synthetic standards). The following volatiles were detected: o-xylene, -pinene, phenol, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. The peak area of the volatile expressed as a proportion of the peak area of the internal standard was used for quantification.. . . Bemisia tabaci Q choice tests with volatiles from D. stramonium. The preferences of B. tabaci Q for the major volatiles released from D. stramonium (o-xylene, -pinene, phenol, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol; see previous section) were investigated using a Y-tube olfactometer. The solvent paraffin oil was included as a vehicle control. The working concentrations of o-xylene (1:500,000), -pinene (1:1,000,000), phenol (1:2,500), and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (1:2,500) were five to eight-fold equivalent in D. stramonium (Table 1). Two streams of purified air (filtered through activated charcoal) were passed through two glass containers (one contained 1 ml solution of the test volatile in paroline and the other contained only 1 ml paroline as a control) into the olfactometer arms at 400 ml min1.. The experiment started with the placement of thirty B. tabaci Q females at the base of the Y-tube. Each test was observed for 30 min, and a choice for one of the two odor sources was recorded when the whitefly reached the end of one arm and stayed there for at least 15 s after 30 min. After finishing each test, odor sources were interchanged to avoid any influence of unforeseen asymmetries in the set-up. There were five treatment comparisons: paroline (CK) vs. CK, CK vs. o-xylene, CK vs. -pinene, CK vs. phenol, and CK vs. 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. This experiment was performed 20 times per comparison, 10 times each day (between 9:00 and 15:00).. . . Bemisia tabaci Q free-choice bioassays with volatiles from D. stramonium. Experiments concerning B. tabaci Q free-choice bioassays were tested as described by Bleeker et al. (2009) with minor modifications. For bioassays with volatiles (mix or single compounds), two potted tomato plants were placed in a screen cage setup at a distance of 50 cm from each other. Three hundred whiteflies were released in the middle and recorded after 10 and 20 min. To test the effect of selected headspace components on repellence and attraction, 50 l solution of synthetic standards (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (the concentration of solution refer to test concentration in Table 1) were applied to 5 filter paper discs (Whatman; 25-mm diameter). The treated (add compound) and controlled (add 50 l solvent paroline) discs were attached respective to two plants with metal wire. The position of the treated tomato was randomized. Five minutes after placing the volatiles on the plant, whiteflies were released. For each component, eight replications were carried out. Prior to each assay with volatiles, the experiment was done with the two plants in a controlled setup, in the same position to allow comparison in the same background. For each volatile compound tested, a new set of plants was used.. . . Data analysis. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to compare the whitefly settling preference on healthy vs. TSWV-infected plants (D. stramonium and pepper). The assumption of sphericity is confirmed by Mauchly's Test. One-way ANOVAs were used to compare whitefly oviposition preference on healthy vs. TSWV-infected plants (D. stramonium and pepper); to compare the life history parameters on the healthy vs. TSWV-infected D. stramonium plants; to compare the four standards in different D. stramonium; and to compare the result of free-choice bioassays with volatiles. One-sample t-tests were used to compare the proportion of whitefly number in the treatment side to the expect proportion of 0.5. SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. All proportional data were arcsine square root transformed before analyses.. . . . Author contributions.
