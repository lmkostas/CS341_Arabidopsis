Results. . NLP8 is required for nitrate-promoted seed germination. Columbia (Col-0) wild-type seeds of Arabidopsis are dormant when harvested from plants grown at 16C (refs 23, 24). The dormant Col-0 seeds did not germinate when imbibed in water, but germinated in the presence of 1mM KNO3. We utilized this system to investigate the nitrate response in seed germination. We previously reported that nitrate-induced gene expression occurs in 6-h imbibed seeds25. Therefore, we hypothesized that seeds imbibed for a short period of time (within 6h), contain all components necessary for nitrate signalling. On the basis of the microarray data from seeds imbibed for <6h (ref. 26), we selected candidate regulators for nitrate signalling in seeds and analysed whether or not corresponding T-DNA insertion mutants displayed nitrate-induced seed germination. Among the mutant lines examined, mutants defective in NIN-like protein8 (NLP8; At2g43500) did not germinate in the presence of 1mM KNO3.. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes nine NLP family members27. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that NLP8 was highly induced in imbibed seeds and the most abundantly expressed NLPs in 6-h imbibed seeds (Fig. 1a). Expression analysis also showed that nitrate does not regulate the mRNA level of NLP8 during seed germination (Supplementary Fig. 1). The nlp8 (nlp8-1 to nlp8-4) and nlp9 (nlp9-1 and nlp9-2) seeds of Col-0 background grown at 16C were used for germination tests (Fig. 1b). Col-0 and nlp9 mutants showed nitrate-promoted germination, however four nlp8 alleles did not (Fig. 1c). The nlp8-2nlp9-1 double mutant showed no germination in the presence of KNO3 (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that NLP8 is required for nitrate-promoted seed germination.. We then investigated whether the role of NLP8 was conserved across accessions. Wassilewskija-4 (Ws-4) and Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) accessions produce dormant seeds even harvested from plants grown at 22C. Seeds of Ws-4 wild-type and nlp8-5 mutant in the Ws-4 background harvested from plants grown at 22C were tested to determine whether germination could be promoted by nitrate (Fig. 1b). Ws-4 seeds, but not nlp8-5 seeds, responded to nitrate (Fig. 1d). We then tested the effect of the nlp8 mutation in the Cvi background. nlp8-2 was crossed to Cvi and near-isogenic lines were isolated after four backcross generations for the nlp8-2 mutation in the Cvi background (nlp8-2/Cvi) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Germination tests were performed using nlp8-2/Cvi and Cvi seeds. We found that the nlp8-2 mutation reduced the seed nitrate response in the Cvi background (Fig. 1d), showing that the requirement for NLP8 in nitrate-promoted germination is conserved across Arabidopsis accessions.. . . NLP8 is involved in nitrate signalling during germination. To examine the specificity of the nlp8 mutant phenotype to nitrate, the effect of stratification was tested. Stratified nlp8-1, nlp8-2 and nlp8-2nlp9-1 were able to germinate without application of KNO3, which was similar to that of the wild type (Supplementary Fig. 3). This indicates that nlp8 mutants are able to respond to the stratification treatment.. NR mutants are defective in both nitrate assimilation and nitric oxide (NO) production2829. To distinguish if the effect of NLP8 on nitrate-regulated germination is triggered by direct nitrate signalling or nitrate assimilation and its products, nlp8-2nia1nia2 and nlp9-1nia1nia2 triple mutants were made. Germination of the nia1nia2 and nlp9-1nia1nia2 mutants was promoted upon application of nitrate (Fig. 2a). However, the nlp8-2nia1nia2 triple mutant did not respond to nitrate (Fig. 2a). This indicates that the role of NLP8 in nitrate-promoted germination involves nitrate signalling, rather than nitrate assimilation or NO production. NO-induced seed germination was shown to be mediated by the N-end rule proteasome degradation pathway, and two enzymes, Proteolysis 6 (PRT6) and Arg-tRNA protein transferase (ATE), were recently shown to be required for NO-promoted seed germination15. The prt6 and ate1ate2 mutants were still sensitive to nitrate-promoted seed germination (Fig. 2a), suggesting that the nitrate and NO signalling pathways are distinct from one another in seed germination.. CHL1 was characterized as a nitrate sensor in Arabidopsis, and phosphorylation at T101 is important for nitrate transport and response16. The chl1 mutant was shown to be less sensitive to nitrate during seed germination10. Therefore, we compared the nitrate responsiveness between nlp8 and chl1 mutants during germination. The chl1-5 mutant contains a deletion that eliminates CHL1, while T101A/chl1-5 and T101D/chl1-5 lines contain the CHL1 mutant genes with T101A and T101D, respectively, in the chl1-5 mutant background16. chl1-5, T101A/chl1-5 and T101D/chl1-5 were tested for their nitrate response in seed germination. Similar to the previous report10, chl1-5 is less sensitive to nitrate-promoted seed germination compared with the Col-0 control (Fig. 2b). However, the insensitivity of chl1-5 to nitrate was only observed at low concentrations of nitrate, while nlp8-2 displayed a more prominent insensitivity to nitrate (Fig. 2b). This indicates that NLP8 regulates a wider range of nitrate responses than CHL1 does during seed germination. The negligible difference in germination phenotypes between chl1-5 and T101A/chl1-5 or T101D/chl1-5 suggested that the phosphorylation status of T101 of CHL1 has little effect on nitrate-promoted seed germination (Fig. 2b).. . . NLP8 regulates gene expression in response to nitrate. An RNA-seq experiment was performed using RNA extracted from Col-0 and nlp8-2 seeds imbibed for 6h with 1mM KNO3 or KCl (Supplementary Data 1). Forty seven upregulated genes and twenty-nine downregulated genes were identified in 6-h imbibed Col-0 seeds (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4). Gene ontology (GO) term distribution indicates genes encoding transcription factors (eight genes, P=0.038) and related to nitrogen metabolism (six genes, P=6.47e-6) are overrepresented among those genes upregulated by nitrate. Some of the known nitrate-inducible genes such as NIA1, NIA2, nitrite reductase1 (NIR1), root-type Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase1 (RFNR1), RFNR2, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase2 (G6PD2) and G2-like transcription factor (AT1G25550) were included in the upregulated genes. In addition as we previously reported, CYP707A2, the main ABA catabolic gene during seed germination, was induced by nitrate. No other genes related to ABA and GA metabolism and signalling were found among the list of nitrate-regulated genes (Supplementary Fig. 5). Nitrate-mediated upregulation of almost all of the nitrate-inducible genes identified by RNA-seq, was absent or was significantly decreased in the nlp8-2 mutant (Fig. 3a). This was also true for the nitrate downregulated genes. Expression of some genes was further analysed by qRT-PCR to examine their expression kinetics on imbibition in the seed. When Col-0 seeds were imbibed in water with KCl, the expression of CYP707A2 increased and then decreased, with its maximum expression at 6h (Fig. 3b). The expression of CYP707A2 in imbibed Col-0 seeds was induced by KNO3 with similar kinetics but at a higher level to that observed for the KCl-treated seeds. CYP707A2 had a much lower level of expression of in nlp8-2 in both KCl and KNO3 imbibed seeds. Importantly, nitrate had no effect on the expression of CYP707A2 in nlp8-2 (Fig. 3b). This was also found to be true for the expression of NIA2 (Fig. 3c). In addition, the expression of another eight genes were analysed by qRT-PCR and we observed expression patterns consistent with the RNA-seq data (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).. . . NLP8 regulates ABA catabolism and induces CYP707A2. To determine whether the nitrate-induced decline in ABA contents is NLP8-dependent, the ABA content was measured in dry seeds and imbibed seeds of Col-0 and nlp8-2 with 1mM KCl or KNO3 (Fig. 4a). In Col-0 seeds, the nitrate-induced ABA decrease was observed at 9h after the onset of imbibition, and the ABA content in KNO3-treated seeds was lower than those in KCl-treated seeds thereafter (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, the ABA content in KNO3-treated nlp8-2 seeds was comparable to that seen in the KCl-treated nlp8-2 seeds, which was equivalent to that in KCl-treated Col-0 seeds (Fig. 4a). This indicates that the ABA decrease by nitrate is NLP8-dependent. The aba2 mutant line, which has a defect in ABA biosynthesis, was non-dormant even when harvested from 16C, and was able to germinate in the absence of nitrate (Fig. 4b). aba2 was found to be epistatic to nlp8-2 since aba2nlp8-2 germinated even without nitrate, showing that de novo ABA biosynthesis is required for nlp8-2 to establish seed dormancy. Col-0 and cyp707a1 responded to nitrate, while cyp707a2 was less sensitive to nitrate (Fig. 4b). Nitrate-promoted germination was not observed in the cyp707a1nlp8-2 and cyp707a2nlp8-2 double mutants (Fig. 4b). It is noteworthy that nitrate-independent expression of CYP707A2 in nlp8-2 by introducing the 35S::CYP707A2 caused nitrate-independent germination (Fig. 4b). Taken together, these results suggest that NLP8-mediated induction of CYP707A2 promotes seed germination in response to nitrate.. To test whether CYP707A2 is a direct target of NLP8, a 1.9-kb 5 non-coding region of CYP707A2 was cloned, fused to a GUS reporter gene (A2-GUS), and transformed into Col-0 (Fig. 5a). The A2-GUS seeds from 16C grown plants were tested for nitrate-induced reporter expression by qRT-PCR. The expression of the native CYP707A2 served as a positive control for measuring nitrate-induction of the reporter gene expression. A2-GUS lines (#1 and #6) displayed nitrate-induced reporter expression similar to the native CYP707A2 (Fig. 5b). Next, a promoter deletion series were made and fused to the GUS reporter gene to identify the promoter region responsible for nitrate induction (Fig. 5a). These promoter deletion constructs, d1-GUS to d3-GUS, were transformed into Col-0 and selected transgenic lines were grown at 16C. The d1-GUS (-1,661) line showed nitrate-induced reporter expression that was similar to the A2-GUS lines. In contrast, the d2-GUS (-1,373) and d3-GUS (-741) lines did not show nitrate-induced reporter expression (Fig. 5b). This indicates that the region between -1,661 and -1,373 is responsible for the nitrate-mediated induction of CYP707A2.. We next generated 35S::NLP8-GFP transgenic lines. Six DNA fragments spanning CYP707A2 as shown in Fig. 5a, were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The co-immunoprecipitated DNA was analysed by quantitative PCR. Relative fold enrichment was calculated by normalizing the value of immunoprecipitated anti-GFP fragments to that of the control sample that did not contain any antibody. Fragments #1 (-1,661 to -1,552) and #2 (-1,549 to -1,383) showed enrichment, but not fragments #3 to #6, in nitrate-treated samples (Fig. 5c), demonstrating a direct binding of NLP8 to these fragments in the promoter region of CYP707A2. Such enrichments were not observed in the KCl-treated samples (Fig. 5c). These results collectively suggest that NLP8 directly binds to the promoter of CYP707A2 in a nitrate-dependent manner and upregulates its expression during seed germination in the presence of nitrate.. A protoplast assay was employed to further narrow down the promoter region responsible for NLP8-dependent expression of CYP707A2. A series of promoter deletions fused to a LUC reporter gene were tested for their nitrate induction when co-transformed with the 35S::NLP8-GFP construct. Two positive controls, A2-LUC and d1-LUC(-1,661), showed the NLP8-dependent nitrate response in the protoplast assay similar to that observed in the A2-GUS and d1-GUS stable transgenic lines (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 8). Nitrate-induced reporter expression was also observed in d1.2-LUC(-1,638), d1.3-LUC(-1,615) and d1.4-LUC(-1,589) but not in d1.5-LUC(-1,549) (Supplementary Fig. 8), indicating that the 41bp region between d1.4 and d1.5 is responsible for NLP8-dependent nitrate induction (Fig. 5d).. To identify the NLP8-binding sites, mutations were introduced to d1.4-LUC and the NLP8-dependent reporter expression was analysed in the presence of nitrate in the protoplast assay (Fig. 5d,e). d1.4-LUC with disruptions of single sites (1m, 2m, 3m) and double sites (1m2m, 1m3m) still responded to NLP8, but the d1.4-LUC with all three sites mutated (1m2m3m) did not respond (Fig. 5e). This result suggests that these three sites are required for NLP8-dependent gene expression.. We next performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to verify the physical interaction between NLP8 and the promoter of CYP707A2. The binding of the RWP-RK domain of NLP8 to the d1-d1.5 fragment resulted a shifted band in the EMSA (Supplementary Fig. 9a). The application of nitrate did not affect its binding (Supplementary Fig. 9a). The shifted band disappeared by addition of competitor d1.4-d1.5 (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 9a), but mutant competitor with all three sites disrupted failed to compete (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 9b). These collectively indicate that NLP8 binds to these three sites in the CYP707A2 promoter.. . . Nitrate activates NLP8 and NLP7 via distinct mechanisms. A 35S::NLP8-GFP construct was introduced into nlp8-2 by crossing them together, and the homozygous lines for both 35S::NLP8-GFP and the nlp8-2 mutation were selected for and designated as NLP8-GFP nlp8-2. NLP8-GFP nlp8-2 was able to germinate in the presence of nitrate (Fig. 6a), showing that NLP8-GFP complemented nlp8-2. It was also found that the constitutive expression of NLP8-GFP did not confer nitrate-independent germination, but that germination of NLP8-GFP nlp8-2 still required nitrate. NLP8-GFP also failed to alleviate the weak reduced nitrate sensitivity phenotype of chl1-5 (Supplementary Fig. 10). Interestingly, the double homozygous line for 35S::NLP7-GFP and the nlp8-2 mutation, NLP7-GFP nlp8-2, failed to complement the nlp8-2 mutation (Fig. 6a). This suggests that NLP7 and NLP8 have distinct functions from one another. To test whether the subcellular localization of NLP8 is under the control of nitrate like it is the case for NLP7, germinated seedlings of 35S::NLP8-GFP and 35S::NLP7-GFP were observed using confocal microscopy to examine subcellular localization of GFP signals with or without nitrate. The GFP signal of the NLP7-GFP was localized to the cytoplasm in the absence of nitrate, and with the application of nitrate became nuclear localized within a few minutes (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Movie 1), as reported in (ref. 22). In contrast, NLP8-GFP was localized in the nuclei regardless of nitrate application (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Movie 2). This suggests that nitrate may activate NLP8 by a different mechanism from that of NLP7.. The N-terminal region of NLP6 was shown to function as a nitrate-dependent transcriptional activation domain20. The N-terminal region (1-576 amino acids) of NLP8 was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (LexA_DB) to make the NLP8N-LexA_DB-YFP effector. The NLP8N-LexA_DB-YFP chimeric transcription factor construct was transformed together with the reporter, LexAOP-35Smini::GUS, into Col-0 plants (Fig. 6c). Similar to NLP8-GFP, NLP8N-LexA_DB-YFP also localized to the nuclei with or without nitrate application (Fig. 6b). Transgenic plants containing both chimeric constructs were examined for reporter expression. Seven-day-old nitrate-starved seedlings and imbibed seeds displayed nitrate-dependent GUS reporter expression (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 11). It is worth noting that, before application of nitrate, NLP8-YFP is localized in nuclei in the guard cells of cotyledons (Fig. 6b), and this cell type is competent (or contains components necessary) to trigger NLP8-dependent nitrate inducible gene expression (Fig. 6d). Taken together, these data indicate that the N-terminal region is responsible for induction of NLP8 by nitrate and NLP8-dependent nitrate signalling is unlikely to involve nitrate-dependent change in protein localization..
