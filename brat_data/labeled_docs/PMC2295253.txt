Results. . Transgenic ABA deficient lines with constitutive expression of ABI4 are glucose insensitive. Screens for sugar insensitive mutants revealed the importance of ABA and ABA signal transduction, in particular ABI4 (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Huijser etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000; Rook etal. 2001). To study the interaction between ABA biosynthesis and ABI4 in sugar signalling we generated transgenic lines with constitutive ABI4 expression driven by a CaMV 35S promoter in an ABA deficient (aba2-1) background. ABI4 expression in these transgenic aba2-1 plants is independent from plant sugar status. Two lines homozygous for the 35S::ABI4 construct were selected, i.e. lines L6 and L10. Both lines germinated normally but showed a stunted growth phenotype (Fig.1a) similar to what has been reported previously for severe ABI4 overexpression lines (Sderman etal. 2000). Expression analysis on control media showed that ABI4 expression is high in L6 and L10 and exceeded glucose-induced ABI4 expression in developmentally arrested WT Col seedlings by approximately 5-8 fold (Fig.1b).. Fig.1Analysis of transgenic ABA deficient lines with constitutive ABI4 expression. Plant phenotypes of WT Col, aba2-1, and two transgenic lines with constitutive ABI4 expression in aba2-1 (L6 and L10) after 2,5weeks of growth on soil (a). ABI4 expression was detected by qRT-PCR in Col, aba2-1, L6 and L10 seedlings grown for two weeks on control or 8% glucose media. Values are averages of two experiments SD (b). Seedling phenotypes after two weeks of growth on control, 8% sorbitol (sorb), 8% glucose (glc) or 8% glucose+0,1muM ABA (glc+ABA). Similar results were obtained in three experiments (c). ApL3 expression was detected by qRT-PCR in Col, aba2-1, L6 and L10 seedlings grown for four days on control half-strength MS (con) or half-strength MS+100mM sucrose (suc) media. Values are averages of three experiments SD (d). The gin phenotype of Col, aba2-1, L6 and L10 was tested by growing the lines for two weeks on control, 8% sorbitol and 8% glucose media. All lines showed greening on control (con) and sorbitol (sorb, osmotic control) media as expected (Fig.1c). On glucose the Col seedlings showed an arrested phenotype whereas aba2-1 showed a gin phenotype as reported before (Fig.1c, Len and Sheen 2003). Also ABI4 expression levels in glucose-arrested Col seedlings were enhanced whereas in aba2-1 ABI4 expression was very low. The L6 and L10 aba2-1/35S::ABI4 lines have very high ABI4 levels but, importantly, display a gin phenotype (Fig.1c). The gin phenotype of aba2-1 and the transgenic lines could be reverted to WT by the addition of 100nM ABA as was reported before for aba mutants (Fig.1c, Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000). Thus, in an ABA deficient background ABI4 overexpression does not restore wild type sensitivity to glucose.. Sucrose feeding induces ApL3 gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings. This sugar regulation of the ApL3 promoter has been used as basis for a screen for sugar response mutants. Rook etal. (2001) reported on isi sugar response mutants that were unable to fully activate ApL3 expression in response to sucrose. The identification of aba2/isi4 and abi4/isi3 as mutants with an impaired sucrose induction phenotype revealed a role for ABA biosynthesis and signalling in control of ApL3 expression (Rook etal. 2001). To study the sugar-induced ApL3 expression in WT Col, aba2-1, L6 and L10 stratified seeds were sown on 100mM sucrose media. After four days plant material was harvested and ApL3 expression levels determined. Sucrose feeding resulted in an approximate six fold induction of ApL3 in Col seedlings (Fig.1d). The induction of ApL3 is 25% lower in the aba2-1 seedlings, which is in agreement with the isi phenotype of aba2/isi4 (Rook etal. 2001). In the L6 and L10 aba2-1/35S::ABI4 lines the ApL3 expression level on sugar-free control media already exceeds that of sugar-treated WT seedlings. Sugar feeding of L6 and L10 seedlings further boosted ApL3 expression 7-9 fold higher than sugar-treated WT seedlings (Fig.1d).. . . Glucose and ABA trigger a similar developmental early seedling arrest. High sugar concentrations arrest early seedling development in Arabidopsis. After germination vegetative seedling growth is blocked, characterized by the absence of cotyledon greening and leaf formation. Equimolar concentrations of an osmotic control did not block development in this early seedling stage (Fig.2a; Zhou etal. 1998; Laby etal. 2000; Rognoni etal. 2007). Previously, Lopez-Molina etal. (2001) showed that treatment with ABA arrested this post-germination switch from embryonic to vegetative growth as well. ABA-arrested seedlings showed neither greening nor leaf formation similar to glucose-arrested seedlings (Fig.2a). In comparison to ABA-arrested seedlings, glucose-arrested seedlings were larger due to the longer hypocotyl and larger cotyledons (Fig.2b). Moreover, significant root growth was observed in glucose-arrested seedlings, which is absent in ABA-arrested seedlings (Fig.2a, b). Further, in glucose-arrested seedlings often a pink colouration was observed, indicative for anthocyanin accumulation that was absent in ABA-arrested seedlings (Fig.2a, b).. Fig.2Glucose and ABA signalling arrest early seedling development and induce a drought tolerant phenotype. Ler-0 seedling phenotypes are shown after growth for twelve days on control (con, half-strength MS+1% sucrose), or on con medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol (sorb), 7% glucose (glc) or 10muM ABA (ABA) (a). A close-up image of a glc-arrested seedling (left) and an ABA-arrested seedling (right) is shown (b). Developmentally arrested seedlings have a drought tolerant phenotype. Seeds were grown on control (con) or on con media containing either 10muM ABA (ABA) or 7% glucose (glc) for nine days. At day nine the seedlings were subjected to a drought treatment as indicated (c). Hereafter seedlings were allowed to recover on control media for five days after which survival was scored. The survival percentage following drought treatment is presented (c). ABA-arrested seedlings possess an enhanced resistance to drought stress compared to non-arrested seedlings (Lopez-Molina etal. 2001). A comparison was made between the drought resistance phenotype of glucose- and ABA-arrested seedlings. Control (non-arrested) seedlings did not survive a drought treatment of 2.5h (Fig.2c). ABA-treated seedlings showed a near 100% survival rate after 6h of drought, the longest treatment tested in our experiments. Glucose-arrested seedlings showed an intermediate drought resistance. After 2.5h of drought stress, glucose-treated seedlings showed a nearly 90% survival rate and after 6h of drought the survival rate was 50% compared to 0% survival observed for control seedlings. Thus, a clear drought resistant phenotype was observed for glucose-arrested seedlings.. The ABA-induced early seedling developmental arrest depends on functional ABI3 and ABI5 genes. abi3 and abi5 mutants did not block early seedling development in response to ABA. Moreover, WT seedlings exposed to ABA showed strongly enhanced ABI3 and ABI5 protein levels (Lopez-Molina etal. 2001, 2002). Both genes encode transcriptional regulators important for seed development and LEA gene expression (Koornneef and Karssen 1994; Parcy etal. 1994, Finkelstein and Lynch 2000; Carles etal. 2002). Lopez-Molina etal. (2002) showed that during the early seedling developmental arrest several LEA genes were re-induced as well. This re-induction of seed transcriptional regulators and LEA gene expression suggested that a late embryogenesis program is re-initiated by ABA treatment, inducing a drought tolerant phenotype in such arrested seedlings (Lopez-Molina etal. 2002). It was investigated whether the same transcriptional regulators and LEA genes were expressed by glucose signalling during early seedling development. A role for ABI5 has been proposed in GIN signalling and ABI5 expression is sugar responsive (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000; Brocard etal. 2002; Arroyo etal. 2003). ABI5 expression thus is a good positive control in this experiment. Gene expression upon glucose feeding was studied by germinating seeds on control medium until the batch reached 70% germination (time point zero, t=0). At this time point a sample was collected for RNA isolation while the rest of the seeds were transferred to control, sorbitol, glucose or ABA containing media for an additional 24h. After 24h samples were collected for gene expression analysis. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), the expression of ABI3, ABI5, AtEM1, AtEM6 and RAB18 was studied in response to the different treatments. Gene expression was studied in three independent experiments. In each experiment the gene expression level at t=0 was set to one (Table2). Some variation in gene expression levels between the three experiments was observed, likely due to the fact that for each experiment independently generated seed batches were used. Generally, continued growth on control media after t=0 resulted in a decreased expression of all five genes (Table2). In contrast, treatments with sorbitol, glucose and ABA enhanced the expression of all genes studied, except for the sorbitol treatment in the second experiment. In this particular experiment gene expression decreased on sorbitol, however, this decrease was less pronounced compared to the control treatment. ABA treatment resulted in the re-induction of ABI3, ABI5 and the LEA genes, which is in line with results reported by Lopez-Molina etal. (2002). Also glucose exposure significantly induced the expression levels of all five genes although the expression levels are in general somewhat lower than in response to ABA. Thus ABI3 is upregulated by glucose as well, which indicated a possible role for ABI3 in glucose responsiveness. The observation that the expression levels of the genes studied are in general lower after sorbitol treatment compared to glucose treatment indicates that the glucose-induced expression is not an osmotic response..

The gene expression levels were measured at t=0 and after a 24h treatment on control media (con, half-strength MS+1% sucrose) and on con media supplemented with either 8% sorbitol (sorb), 8% glucose (glc) or 10muM ABA (ABA) media. The expression level at t=0 was set to 1. The experiment was performed three times and the results for each experiment are indicated. Expression studies using seedlings grown for five days on control, sorbitol (7%) or glucose (7%) media confirmed the induction of these genes (Fig.3). In five days old glucose-arrested seedlings enhanced expression levels were detected for ABI3 and ABI5 as well as the LEA genes AtEM1, AtEM6 and RAB18. The induction of these genes by sorbitol was roughly five fold lower (Fig.3). After 72h of growth on ABA-free media, seedlings lose the capacity to re-induce ABI3, ABI5 and LEA expression and to arrest early seedling development in response to ABA (Lopez-Molina etal. 2001, 2002). To study whether the induction by glucose is restricted to a similar time frame seeds were germinated and grown for three days on half-strength MS and subsequently switched for two additional days to elevated sorbitol and glucose media. The re-induction by glucose of ABI3, ABI5, EM1, EM6 and RAB18 was largely lost (Fig.3, glc 72h). The weaker induction by sorbitol is essentially lost after three days (Fig.3, sorb 72h). Thus, the glucose-response that induced ABI3, ABI5 and LEA expression is confined to a similar time frame as observed for ABA. This is in agreement with the finding that glucose regulation of ABI4 and ABI5 expression was dependent on developmental stage (Arroyo etal. 2003) and that sugar arrests early seedling development only in a small 2-3day time frame after sowing (Gibson etal. 2001).. Fig.3The glucose-regulated expression of ABI3, ABI5 and LEA genes is restricted to a limited time frame after the start of germination. The expression of EM1, EM6, RAB18, ABI3 and ABI5 genes was quantified by qRT-PCR after germination and growth for five days on different media. Ler-0 seeds were plated for five days on control media (con, half-strength MS+1% sucrose), or on con medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol (sorb) or 7% glucose (glc). The values are an average of three experiments and in each experiment the expression on glc was set to one. It was investigated whether this gene expression regulation is limited to a small time window after the start of germination as has been shown for ABA regulation (Lopez-Molina etal. 2002). Therefore seeds were germinated on con media for three days and thereafter switched to either sorb (sorb 72h) or glc media (glc 72h). In conclusion, the glucose-induced block of early seedling development mimics the ABA-induced arrest of vegetative development in young seedlings. Both glucose- and ABA-arrested seedlings have a drought resistant phenotype and show enhanced expression levels of seed expressed genes. The observation that ABI4 overexpression is unable to restore WT glucose sensitivity in the aba2-1 mutant shows that WT ABA biosynthesis is essential for the GIN response. Apparently, next to ABI4 additional factors which are under control of ABA are important for GIN signalling. Two candidates are ABI3 and ABI5. Both play a role in the ABA-induced early seedling developmental arrest and gene expression and protein stability of both transcription factors is affected by ABA (Lopez-Molina etal. 2001; Lopez-Molina etal. 2002; Lopez-Molina etal. 2003; Zhang etal. 2005; this study). A role for ABI5 in glucose signalling has been established; abi5-1 has a gin phenotype (although somewhat weaker compared to abi4) and ABI5 expression is regulated by sugar (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000; Brocard etal. 2002; Arroyo etal. 2003; this study see . Table 2). However, a role for ABI3 is controversial (for review Finkelstein and Gibson 2001; Leon and Sheen 2003; Gibson 2004; Rognoni etal. 2007). Since ABI3 is important for the ABA-induced developmental arrest and is induced by glucose, our hypothesis is that ABI3 is involved in GIN signalling as well. Therefore, the gin phenotype and glucose-regulated gene expression were studied in abi3 mutants.. . . abi3 mutants are glucose insensitive. The glucose insensitive phenotype of WT Ler-0 and the abi3 mutant was investigated by plating seeds of both genotypes on media with elevated glucose concentrations (6-8% glucose). Initially, two abi3 mutant alleles were tested, i.e. the weak abi3-1 allele (producing normal, drought tolerant seeds) and the strong abi3-5 allele (producing green, drought intolerant seeds, Ooms etal. 1993). As expected WT Ler-0 early seedling development was arrested in response to high glucose concentrations. In contrast, approximately 60-100% (differed between experiments) of both abi3-1 and abi3-5 seedlings showed greening on high glucose media, suggesting that abi3 is a gin mutant, (Fig.4a). All genotypes showed greening on control and osmotic control media (Fig.4a, control and 7% sorbitol, respectively). The gin phenotype was observed for abi3 mutants in several experiments using independently grown and harvested seed batches (data not shown). Next, the strength of the gin phenotype of abi3-1 was assessed in comparison to that of the ABA deficient mutant aba1-1, which is in the Ler-0 background as well. The aba1-1 mutant, like other ABA deficient mutants tested, was shown to possess a gin phenotype (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Huijser etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000). A similar percentage of seedling greening was observed for aba1-1 and abi3-1 when grown on glucose media (Fig.4b) suggesting that both mutants possess a comparable gin phenotype.. Fig.4abi3 mutants have a gin phenotype. Representative Ler-0, abi3-1 and abi3-5 seedlings are shown that were grown for 12days on control media (half-strength MS+1% sucrose), or on control medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol or 7% glucose (a). The gin phenotype of abi3-1 was compared to that of the ABA deficient mutant aba1-1. Seedlings were grown for 12days on the indicated media before seed germination and seedling greening were scored (b). Six additional mutant alleles (abi3-8, abi3-9, abi3-10, abi3-11, abi3-12, and abi3-13) were obtained (a kind gift of Dr. E. Nambara) and tested for their gin phenotype. These abi3 mutants were tested along with two known gin mutants, abi4-3 and abi5-7 in the gin assay. All these mutants were retrieved from a screen for mutants insensitive to the unnatural (-)-ABA (Nambara etal. 2002). The ABA insensitivity of the mutants was tested by plating the mutants on half-strength MS media containing 1% sucrose+10muM ABA. The ABA insensitivity observed was in agreement with that reported by Nambara etal. (2002) (see Table3). The abi3-8, abi3-9, abi3-10, abi4-3 and abi5-7 mutants had a strong ABA insensitivity, the abi3-12 and abi3-13 showed a weaker phenotype. We did observe 40% greening for abi3-13 on ABA media while originally no abi phenotype was observed for this allele (Nambara etal. 2002). These mutants were isolated on (-)-ABA and the (-)-ABA insensitivity does not necessarily parallel (+)-ABA insensitivity (Nambara etal. 2002). Next, these mutants were plated on control, sorbitol- and glucose-containing media, respectively. On 7% glucose media strong gin phenotypes were observed for abi4/gin6 and abi5 mutants as shown by the high percentages of greening, in agreement with earlier reports (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Huijser etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000). Again a strong gin phenotype was observed for abi3, in agreement with our observation using abi3-1 and abi3-5 mutants. Five out of the six additional abi3 mutants tested show a gin phenotype. For four abi3 mutants the gin phenotype was comparable to that of abi4-3 and abi5-7 (Table3). The strong ABA insensitive abi3 mutants are strong gin mutants as well whereas the mutants with a weaker phenotype (abi3-11 and abi3-12) show a weaker phenotype on glucose media. However, exceptionally abi3-13 shows a weak abi phenotype but a strong gin phenotype. The abi3-11 mutant lacks an ABI insensitive phenotype and did not show a gin phenotype either. In conclusion, gin phenotype analysis of eight abi3 alleles confirms the glucose insensitive phenotype for abi3. Moreover, the gin phenotype of abi3 is comparable to that of other known gin mutants like aba1, abi4 and abi5..

Values are the percentage of cotyledon greening scored after 11days. The experiment was repeated once with similar resultsaThe ABA insensitivity scored for the different mutant alleles based on cotyledon greening by Nambara etal. (2002). . . Glucose-induced expression of ABI4, ABI5 and RAB18 is reduced in abi3. Glucose-induced early seedling developmental arrest is associated with expression of ABI3, ABI4, ABI5 and a subset of LEA genes (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Cheng etal. 2002; Arroyo etal. 2003; this study). The involvement of ABI3 in glucose-regulated gene expression was tested for three genes ABI4, ABI5 and RAB18 as a representative of the LEA genes. For expression analysis the weak abi3-1 and the strong abi3-5 mutants were used. Seedlings of all three genotypes were grown for 24h on control media or on control media containing 8% glucose.. Both RAB18 and ABI5 expression were sensitive to glucose addition. In WT seedlings, glucose treatment induced these two genes on average 14times in comparison to t=0 (Fig.5a, c). However, on glucose the expression levels of both genes were much reduced in abi3-1 and abi3-5 compared to WT (Fig.5a, c). Glucose treatment did not result in a clear induction of ABI4, especially when compared to ABI5 and RAB18. Instead ABI4 expression was roughly maintained to the same level observed for t=0 but was enhanced when compared to the control treatment which displayed a strong reduction of ABI4 expression (Fig.5b). ABI4 transcripts were 2-8 fold lower in the abi3 mutant backgrounds upon glucose treatment. Thus, the abi3 mutation did not allow full glucose-induced expression of RAB18, ABI4 and ABI5. Interestingly, the reduced expression is most pronounced in the strong abi3-5 mutant background.. Fig.5Altered glucose-regulated gene expression in abi3 mutants. Glucose-regulated gene expression was studied in WT Ler-0 and abi3-1 and abi3-5 mutants. Gene expression was quantified by qRT-PCR at t=0, the time of glucose application and after 24h on control medium (con, half-strength MS+1% sucrose) or con medium supplemented with 8 % glucose. At the t=0 time point approximately 70% of the seeds had germinated. The values indicate an average of three independent experiments (two experiments for abi3-5). The WT Ler-0 expression on 8% glucose was set to one in each experiment. The glucose-regulated expression in Ler-0 and the two abi3 mutants was studied for RAB18 (a), ABI4 (b) and ABI5 (c). The gene expression ratio of Ler-0 over abi3 was calculated because all three genes were already under expressed in abi3-1 and abi3-5 at t=0. This ratio was calculated by dividing the average gene expression in Ler-0 by the expression in abi3 (for both mutants) at t=0 and after 8% glucose treatment for all three genes (d). Already at t=0 reduced expression levels for all three genes were observed in the abi3 mutant backgrounds. This was expected since the ABI transcription factors were found to affect each others expression in seeds (Sderman etal. 2000). Moreover, ABI3 is an important regulator of LEA gene expression (Parcy etal. 1994; Kermode 2005). To rule out that this reduced expression is responsible for the phenotype observed after glucose treatment the gene expression ratios of WT over mutant were determined for t=0 and after glucose feeding. For each gene the expression level of WT is divided by the expression level of each mutant. These values show the fold difference of expression between WT and both abi3 mutants (Fig.5d). E.g. the level of RAB18 expression is 9 fold higher in WT compared to abi3-1 at t=0. After glucose treatment the fold difference for RAB18 expression was 38. Except for the ABI4 expression ratio of Ler-0 over abi3-1, all WT/mutant expression ratios showed increased values after glucose exposure. This confirms that both mutants have a reduced ability to control glucose-regulated gene expression.. . . Other sugar insensitive phenotypes of abi3. The sugar response phenotype of the abi3-1 mutant was investigated in the sis, sun and glucose-induced delay of germination assays. High sucrose concentrations block early seedling development similar to high glucose concentrations. High sucrose resistant mutants are known as sis mutants (Laby etal. 2000). Several mutants affected in the same genes were retrieved from gin and sis screens, e.g. gin1/sis4/aba2, gin6/sis5/abi4 and gin4/sis1/ctr1. The sis phenotype of WT Ler-0, abi3-1 and abi3-5 was analysed by plating these genotypes on 13% sucrose media. Both abi3 mutants show a sucrose insensitive phenotype (Fig.6a, b) and can thus be considered as sis as well as gin mutants.. Fig.6The abi3-1 mutant shows additional sugar signalling defects. The sugar response phenotype of abi3-1 was assessed in three additional assays. The sugar insensitive (sis) phenotype was assessed by scoring the early seedling developmental phenotype (by seedling greening) after growth on elevated sucrose concentration. Representative Ler-0, abi3-1 and abi3-5 seedling phenotypes are shown after growth on 13% sucrose media for 13days (a). The percentage of germination and seedling greening of Ler-0, abi3-1 and abi3-5 was determined after growth for 13days on control (half-strength MS+1% sucrose) or on control medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol or 13% sucrose media (b). The sucrose uncoupled (sun) phenotype was assessed by measuring plastocyanin (PC) expression levels by qRT-PCR in two days old seedlings grown on sucrose containing media in darkness. Sucrose repressed the PC transcript level in dark-grown two days old WT seedlings in comparison to WT seedlings grown on sugar-free media, however in sun mutants PC repression by sucrose is much less pronounced (Dijkwel etal. 1997). Indicated are the relative PC expression on sucrose containing media for WT PC-LUC and sun6/abi4 (assayed on 2% sucrose) and Ler-0 and abi3-1 (assayed on 1% sucrose). Values indicate an average of at least three experiments. PC expression of two days old seedlings grown on sugar-free half-strength MS was set to 1 for each genotype in every experiment (c). Germination is delayed by glucose addition. abi3-1 was tested for glucose-induced delay of germination by plating seeds on half-strength MS (0.5MS), 0.5MS+7% sorbitol (7% sorb) and 0.5MS+7% glucose (7% glc). Sugars were already present during stratification (solid lines). In addition, seeds were stratified on sugar-free 0.5MS media and directly after stratification transferred to 0.5MS+7% sorbitol (MS>7% sorb) and 0.5MS+7% glucose (MS>7% glc, dashed lines). Seed germination after the different treatments was scored daily for eight days for Ler-0 (d) and abi3-1 (e). Dijkwel etal. (1997) previously reported on sugar insensitive mutants that have been isolated using the sun screen. Dark-grown seedlings transiently express photosynthesis genes, including plastocyanin (PC, Dijkwel etal. 1996). This transient increase of photosynthesis gene expression is repressed on sucrose media. In sun mutants sucrose did not repress this transient PC gene expression in dark grown seedlings (Dijkwel etal. 1997). sun6 is such a mutant which was shown to be allelic to abi4 (Huijser etal. 2000). A possible sun phenotype of abi3-1 was investigated by quantifying PC mRNA levels in two days old, dark-grown seedlings using qRT-PCR. Elevated PC expression was observed in sucrose-treated seedlings of sun6/abi4-3 compared to its WT PC-LUC parent confirming its sun phenotype (Fig.6c). Interestingly, the abi3-1 mutant showed enhanced PC expression as well and, therefore, abi3 has a sun phenotype (Fig.6c). abi4 mutants displayed a nine fold increased PC expression level in sugar-treated seedlings compared to WT. In the abi3 mutants the PC expression level is only two fold increased, indicating that abi3 is a weak sun mutant.. Sugars delay seed germination in Arabidopsis. ABA plays a role in this glucose-induced delay of germination (Ullah etal. 2002; Price etal. 2003; Dekkers etal. 2004; Chen etal. 2006). Despite the involvement of ABA, several abi mutants (abi1-1, abi2-1, abi4 and abi5) are normally sensitive to glucose during germination (Price etal. 2003; Dekkers etal. 2004). Sugar insensitive mutants like gin6/abi4 and gin2/hxk1 that are insensitive to the glucose-induced early seedling developmental arrest are sensitive to glucose during germination (defined as radicle emergence). This indicates that the glucose response during germination (which delays radicle protrusion) and early seedling growth (which arrests seedling development) are two distinct processes (Price etal. 2003; Dekkers etal. 2004). The, abi3-1 and abi3-5 alleles were plated on 2.5% glucose. The presence of 2.5% glucose clearly delayed germination of WT seeds. The osmotic control of 2.5% sorbitol only slightly affected germination compared to control media. Both abi3 mutants showed a clear resistance against glucose as displayed by their reduced germination delay (data not shown), which is in agreement with observations of Yuan and Wysocka-Diller (2006) who reported on the glucose insensitivity of abi3-1 during germination.. In our experiments seeds were sterilized, plated on sugar media, and after a three day stratification period moved to the growth chamber and germination was scored the following days. Interestingly, when WT seeds were stratified on sugar-free media (half-strength MS) and after stratification transferred to sugar-containing plates, the delay of germination by 2.5% glucose was completely lost (data not shown). Thus, stratification on sugar-free media suppressed the inhibitory effect of glucose on germination. This effect of stratification was further investigated using higher (7%) glucose and sorbitol concentrations. Ler-0 and abi3-1 seeds were plated either on control, sorbitol or glucose media, stratified for three days and moved to the growth chamber. Alternatively, seeds were stratified on sugar-free control media and shifted to media containing sorbitol or glucose, and then placed in the growth chamber. Continuous treatment with 7% glucose severely delayed germination of WT seeds but affected abi3-1 significantly less as expected (Fig.6d, e). Also in this experiment, stratification on sugar-free media strongly suppressed the germination response to glucose in WT Ler-0. Even germination of the abi3-1 mutant, which already showed a reduced sensitivity to glucose during germination could be improved by stratification on sugar-free media. The germination speed of the abi3-1 mutant after stratification on sugar-free media was similar to the osmotic control indicating that this combination completely suppressed the germination delay by glucose. The glucose response during germination was affected by stratification but not the osmotic response (sorbitol treatment). This was observed for WT Ler-0 as well as the abi3-1 mutant thereby differentiating glucose from osmotic signalling.. . . abi2-1 and era1-2 mutant are glucose response mutants. Our results on the physiological and molecular level indicate that glucose-arrested seedlings mimic ABA-arrested seedlings. The finding that ABI3 is important for glucose signalling in addition to ABI4 and ABI5 led us to test the glucose insensitive phenotype of two other ABA signalling mutants, i.e. abi2-1 and era1. Brady etal. (2003) proposed a genetic pathway for ERA1 and the ABI1-ABI5 genes in seed ABA responsiveness based on double mutant analysis between the era1 mutant and the abi mutants. This analysis suggested that ABI1 and ABI2 act at or upstream of ERA1, while ERA1 acts at or upstream of ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5 (Brady etal. 2003). ABI2 encodes a phosphatase 2C protein that acts as a negative regulator of ABA signalling and the abi2-1 mutation results in an ABA insensitive phenotype (Koornneef etal. 1984; Leung etal. 1997). WT Ler-0 and abi2-1 seeds were plated along with abi3-1 on control, 7% sorbitol and 7% glucose media. In addition to abi3, the abi2-1 mutant displayed a gin phenotype as well, although its phenotype is not as strong as that of abi3-1 (Fig.7a). On control and sorbitol media all seedlings showed greening.. Fig.7Other ABA signalling mutants have sugar signalling defects as well. Putative glucose signalling defects were determined for the ABA insensitive mutant abi2-1 and the ABA oversensitive mutant era1-2. Ler-0, abi2-1 and abi3-1 were grown on control media (half-strength MS+1% sucrose), or on control medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol or 7% glucose. After 12days germination and seedling greening percentage were scored (a). To investigate whether era1-2 has a glucose oversensitive phenotype both WT Col and mutant were grown on a sugar concentration which did not arrest early development of WT Col. Therefore, seedling greening of Col and the era1-2 mutant was scored daily on half-strength MS (0.5MS) and on 0.5MS+6% glucose. The seedling phenotype was scored for 11days (b). The ERA1 gene encodes a beta subunit of a protein farnesyl transferase (Cutler etal. 1996) and acts as a negative regulator of ABA signalling. The era1-2 mutant has an ABA hypersensitive phenotype. If ERA1 exerts a similar function in glucose signalling, a glucose oversensitive (glo) phenotype is expected for the era1-2 mutant. Seeds of WT Col and era1-2 were plated on half-strength MS+6% glucose media. This glucose concentration allowed seedling greening of the WT Col seedlings. Greening started for WT seedlings from day four onwards. However, this glucose concentration arrested early seedling development of era1-2 seedlings. Even after eleven days no greening was observed for era1-2 seedlings (Fig.7b), which indicates that era1-2 indeed has a glo phenotype. The era1-2 mutant has a more dormant phenotype compared to WT (Cutler etal. 1996). Therefore, seed germination was synchronized as much as possible by using after-ripened seeds and employing a three day stratification period on sugar-free media. On control media (half-strength MS) germination was somewhat delayed but that did not affect cotyledon greening. On 6% glucose era1-2 germination reached similar germination levels as WT seeds despite that germination was 1-2 days delayed (data not shown). This slower germination of era1-2 does not explain the much larger difference observed for cotyledon greening on glucose media. Thus, the small difference in germination timing between era1-2 and WT is not responsible for the seedling greening phenotype..
