Results. . Immature leaves of ss4 plants contain almost no starch. We extended the characterisation of ss4 mutants, using the ss4-1 mutant allele (Roldn etal., 2007) and a further T-DNA insertion line, ss4-3, which lacks SS4 protein (Fig. S1a).. Examination of whole rosettes and mature leaves largely confirmed previous reports of the ss4 phenotype (Roldn etal., 2007). Compared with wild-type plants, ss4 plants had slightly reduced soluble starch synthase activities, 40% less chlorophyll (Table S2), less degradation of starch during the night (measured as end-of-day minus end-of-night starch contents) and higher end-of-night starch contents (Fig. S1b), and slower growth rates under both long and short photoperiods (Fig. S1c).. As reported previously (Roldn etal., 2007), mature ss4 leaves appeared to have only one large, rounded starch granule per chloroplast (Figs 1a,b, S1d,e). Quantification of granule numbers (using Method 2 from Crumpton-Taylor et al., 2012) revealed that mature, nonflowering rosettes of wild-type and ss4-3 plants had 5.540.28 and 0.870.14 granules per chloroplast, respectively (meanSE from eight chloroplast preparations in both cases).. .

Whereas immature leaves of wild-type plants have more starch granules per chloroplast than mature leaves (Crumpton-Taylor et al., 2012), no starch granules were visible by light or electron microscopy in immature leaves of ss4 plants (Fig.1c,d). Consistent with this observation, the youngest leaves of ss4 rosettes did not stain with iodine at the end of the day (Fig.2a), and quantitative measurements revealed very low starch contents and little diel starch turnover (Fig.2c,d). Starch content and turnover increased with leaf age, but turnover was limited even in mature leaves. By contrast, in wild-type plants starch content and starch turnover were at their maximum in young leaves (leaves 5-8), and values were similar or somewhat lower in mature leaves (Fig.2b,d). Starch was not replaced with soluble glucan in ss4 leaves. For both mature and immature leaves, ss4 soluble glucan contents were lower than or comparable with wild-type contents (Fig.2e). Thus, loss of SS4 dramatically reduces the rate of acquisition of glucan storage and turnover capacity during leaf development. Mutants fail to form starch granules until late in leaf development, and then only about one granule is formed per chloroplast.. . Figure 2. .

Decolourised rosettes were stained with iodine solution. (b) Starch contents of wild-type leaves at the end of the day (black) and the end of the night (white).

Measurements were made on a separate batch of plants from those shown in (b-d). Leaf 1 is the youngest and leaf 16 the oldest leaf. Starch: black (end of day) and white (end of night). Soluble glucan: dark grey (end of day) and light grey (end of night). Values are means of measurements on at least five rosettes. Error bars,SE.. . . . We examined whether loss of SS4 affected starch content in the primary root cap, a region of high starch content in wild-type plants. Starch in the columella cells is essential for the normal gravitropic response of the root (Kiss et al., 1989; Blancaflor et al., 1998; Kiss & Edelmann, 1999). There was wide variation in the amount and location of starch in root caps of ss4 seedlings grown on vertical agar plates. Some ss4 root caps were not distinguishable from those of wild-type plants, but in most cases starch content was reduced with some or all cells having no visible starch. Roots of ss4 seedlings tended to deviate from vertical growth, and the degree of deviation was broadly negatively correlated with starch content (Fig. S2).. . . Starch synthesis in immature ss4 leaves is not restored by blocking starch degradation. We considered the possibility that starch granules are formed in immature ss4 leaves, but are immediately degraded. To examine this possibility, we introduced into the ss4 background a mutation that blocks starch degradation in wild-type plants. The sex1 mutation affects glucan, water dikinase (GWD), a starch-phosphorylating enzyme that renders the surface of the starch granule accessible to starch degrading enzymes at night (Stitt & Zeeman, 2012). Mutants lacking GWD have a strongly reduced rate of starch degradation at night, and accumulate very high concentrations of starch in all leaves (Zeeman & ap Rees, 1999; Yu et al., 2001).. The ss4sex1 double mutants grew more slowly than ss4 mutants, at about the same rate as sex1 mutants (Fig. S3). Mature leaves had high starch contents at the end of both the day and the night. However, immature leaves contained very little starch and most chloroplasts appeared to contain no granules (Figs3, S3). Some profiles of chloroplasts in sections of mature ss4sex1 leaves also had no starch granules and others contained few, rounded granules of variable size, whereas sex1 chloroplasts in mature leaves were packed with flattened granules (Fig.3). Thus, introduction of a mutation that drastically reduces starch degradation in a wild-type background had only minor effects on starch granule formation in ss4 leaves.. . Figure 3. .

The arrows indicate starch granules. Note that sex1 starch granules are flattened, whereas ss4sex1 granules are rounded and of very variable sizes. Bars, 4mum.. . . . . . Leaves of ss4 mutants accumulate very high concentrations of ADPglucose. The experiments described above show that neither starch granules nor soluble glucans accumulate in immature ss4 leaves. This observation suggests that the actions of starch synthase isoforms other than SS4 may be dependent on SS4. To test this idea, we measured the impact of the loss of SS4 on concentrations of the starch synthase substrate ADPglucose. Concentrations were 50-200 times higher in ss4-1 and ss4-3 rosettes than in wild-type rosettes, and were elevated in both mature and immature leaves (Tables1, S3). This was a highly specific effect. Analysis of mutants lacking any of the other three isoforms of soluble starch synthase (the ss1,ss2 and ss3 mutants) revealed less than two-fold differences between their ADPglucose concentrations and those of wild-type plants (Table 1). In the ss4 mutant there were no large alterations with respect to wild-type plants in concentrations of soluble glucans (as previously shown, Fig.2e) or other intermediates of starch and sucrose synthesis, glycolysis and the Calvin-Benson cycle, and the Krebs cycle (Table 1).. .

Metabolites were extracted in chloroform/methanol and assayed by anion exchange chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry. Values are means of measurements on six rosettesSD.. . . . As expected of any mutant with a reduced capacity to generate sugars from starch at night (e.g. pgm1, Gibon et al., 2004; mex1, Niittyl etal., 2004; lsf1, Comparot-Moss et al., 2010), sucrose concentrations were elevated in ss4 plants during the day, and sucrose and hexose concentrations were lower in ss4 than in wild-type plants during most of the night (Fig. S1b; see also Roldn etal., 2007).. . . Starch synthesis in an ss4 background is partially but not fully restored by expression of Agrobacterium glycogen synthase. The results above imply that SS4 directly or indirectly provides a primer required for the actions of other starch synthases. To investigate this possibility, we overexpressed glycogen synthase (GS) from A.tumefaciens in an ss4 background. We chose this enzyme because it is reported both to elongate glucan chains and to initiate chains de novo via an autoglucosylation mechanism (Ugalde et al., 2003), using ADPglucose as its substrate. Thus it might replace the function of SS4 by providing glucosylated proteins as primers for other starch synthases, resulting in the formation of starch granules. We introduced the GS into plants lacking both SS4 and SS3 (the ss3ss4 double mutant), because these mutants contain even fewer starch granules than the ss4 mutant (Szydlowski et al., 2009; Mrida & DHulst, 2012). Indeed, in our growth conditions, (12h:12h, light:dark), ss3ss4 plants were pale, slow growing and contained very little starch (Figs 4, S4).. . Figure 4. .

Values are meansSE of measurements on five 30-d-old plants. (b) Electron (left) and light (right) micrographs of mature leaves from Col-0, ss3ss4 and GS-transformed ss3ss4 plants, 10h into the light period. Sections for light microscopy were stained with toluidine blue. Bars: 2mum (for electron micrographs), 10mum (for light micrographs). Black arrowheads indicate starch granules in plastids. White arrowheads indicate plastids that are devoid of starch.. . . . Agrobacterium GS was introduced into ss3ss4 plants as a fusion protein consisting of an N-terminal Rubisco small subunit chloroplast transit peptide, then a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), then GS (Fig. S4). Examination of four independent GS-transformed ss3ss4 plants with confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed that the protein was targeted to chloroplasts. Analysis of crude extracts of leaves by nondenaturing PAGE on gels containing glycogen revealed abundant GS activity in these plants (Fig. S4).. All GS-expressing lines had higher growth rates and more starch than ss3ss4 mutants (Figs4, S4). However, complementation was quantitatively and qualitatively incomplete. Although ADPglucose was reduced from 423113nmolg-1 FW in ss3ss4 plants to 4019nmolg-1 FW in transformed line G-5-3 (see Figs4, S4), this concentration was still many times greater than that of wild-type plants grown under the same conditions (1.290.23nmolg-1 FW: meansSD of measurements on three to five plants per line). Importantly, both the distribution and the nature of starch granules in the GS-expressing plants were very different from those of wild-type plants. In leaf sections, starch granules were visible in some chloroplasts but not in others. Furthermore, chloroplasts of a single cell appeared to contain a huge range of granule morphologies and sizes (Fig.4). As expected of amylopectin, polymers from starch granules in GS-expressing lines had a polymodal distribution of chain lengths. However, the pattern of distribution was not the same as that of amylopectin from wild-type leaves (Fig. S4). Thus, either the additional glucan-synthesizing capacity or the autoglucosylation activity provided by Agrobacterium GS can promote starch granule formation in the ss3ss4 background, but neither of these functions of GS can fully restore normal starch synthesis.. . . Starch synthesis in immature ss4 leaves is partially restored by increased chloroplast volumes. The results above show that formation of new granules occurs much less frequently during leaf development in ss4 leaves than in wild-type leaves. We showed previously that in wild-type plants the number of starch granules present in a chloroplast is a function of its volume, and that the number per unit volume is relatively constant for a given leaf developmental stage (Crumpton-Taylor et al., 2012). Based on these observations, we speculated that the unit volume required per granule formation event might be much larger in ss4 than in wild-type leaves. Average chloroplast volumes double over the course of leaf expansion (Crumpton-Taylor et al., 2012), thus the delayed formation of granules in ss4 leaves might reflect that fact that chloroplast volumes are larger in mature than in immature leaves.. In order to test this idea, we examined the impact on granule formation in the ss4 background of the introduction of mutations that dramatically increase chloroplast volumes. The accumulation and replication of chloroplast (arc) mutants have few, giant chloroplasts per mesophyll cell, but the same number of starch granules per unit chloroplast volume as wild-type plants (Crumpton-Taylor et al., 2012). Chloroplast sizes and numbers in arc3ss4,arc5ss4,arc6ss4 and arc10ss4 double mutants were similar to those in the respective arc parent (between one (arc6) and 25 (arc10) chloroplasts per cell, compared with 100 chloroplasts per wild-type cell, not shown). Nondenaturing PAGE analysis revealed no differences in activities of starch synthase isoforms other than SS4 between the parental and double mutant lines (Fig. S5).. The double mutants differed from the ss4 parent in that starch granules were visible in some chloroplasts in sections of immature leaves (Fig. S5) and starch turnover was comparable with that of the arc parent and wild-type plants (Fig. S5h,i). However, starch synthesis in double mutants was different in several respects from that of arc and wild-type plants. Although some chloroplasts in immature ss4 leaves contained granules, others apparently contained none (Fig. S5f,g). Granule numbers per unit chloroplast volume appeared to be lower than in wild-type plants throughout leaf expansion. In both immature and mature leaves, the range of granule sizes was larger in double mutants than in ss4 or arc mutants, or wild-type plants (Figs5c, S5). The granules of double mutants were rounded rather than flattened, similar to those of ss4 mutants (Fig S5). Thus, although granule formation in the absence of SS4 started earlier during leaf expansion development in arc mutant backgrounds than in a wild-type background, it was highly sporadic and qualitatively different from that in wild-type plants.. .

All genotypes were grown together in the same conditions. (a) Stromal area per starch granule for mature leaves of wild-type (WT), ss4,arc and arc x ss4 mutants. Values are chloroplast cross-sectional area divided by numbers of granules in that area.

The solid line in the box is the median (50th percentile). The bottom and top of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles. Upper and lower bars indicate the range of values. Between 319 and 2270 granules were measured on 11 randomly-selected scanning electron micrographs of starch from 40 25-d-old plants per genotype, at the end of the light period.. . . . . . Loss of SS4 from established plants affects granule numbers in immature but not mature leaves. Taken together, the observations above suggest that the primary effect of loss of SS4 is a strongly delayed and infrequent formation of new starch granules during leaf development. The alterations in granule number and starch turnover in mature leaves may be secondary consequences of this effect. To distinguish more clearly between primary and secondary effects, we reduced SS4 concentrations in mature rosettes by inducing expression of an RNAi hairpin construct targeted at the SS4 gene, and examined the consequences for granule numbers and starch turnover.. Wild-type plants were transformed with constructs allowing expression of two hairpin RNAs based on different parts of the SS4 gene sequence, under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter (Figs S6, S7). Transgenic plants were treated with dexamethasone daily for 10d. For each construct, one line showing strong reductions in SS4 protein was selected for further study. Before dexamethasone treatment, SS4 transcript and protein concentrations were the same in transgenic lines and wild-type plants. SS4 protein concentrations were unaffected by dexamethasone treatment in wild-type controls (Fig. S6b and not shown). In transgenic lines, SS4 transcript levels declined to very low values within 24-48h of the first dexamethasone treatment and remained low. Concentrations of SS4 protein fell slowly to undetectable levels over the first 7d of dexamethasone treatment (Fig.6a).. . Figure 6. .

(d) Transmission electron micrographs of young leaves of wild-type and RNAi line B plants after 10d of dex treatment. Bar, 2mum.. . . . After 10d of dexamethasone treatment, whole rosettes of transgenic lines had higher end-of-night starch contents than control plants (although lower than in ss4 plants), but diel starch turnover was at least 94% of that in wild-type plants and more than twice that in ss4 plants. There was little or no difference between transgenic and control plants in whole-rosette starch content at the end of the day, average granule radius (Fig.6b) and granule size distribution (Fig. S6c). In sections of mature leaves, the chloroplast area per starch granule was the same in transformed and control plants. However, in immature leaves that had emerged during the dexamethasone treatment (leaves 1-4) the chloroplast area per starch granule was c. 50% greater in transgenic than in control plants (Fig.6c,d). In summary, reduced SS4 concentrations strongly reduced starch granule numbers in young leaves, but had little effect in mature leaves.. . . SS4 concentrations can be substantially reduced without affecting starch granule formation. We investigated whether the amount of SS4 in a wild-type leaf limits starch granule formation. This possibility is suggested by a report that transgenic Arabidopsis plants with elevated concentrations of SS4 protein have increased rates of starch synthesis (Gmez-Arjona et al., 2011). First, we examined starch turnover in leaves of ss4 plants expressing the Arabidopsis SS4 cDNA from the CaMV 35S promoter. Starch content and turnover were restored to near wild-type levels in both immature and mature leaves of several transgenic lines that had much lower concentrations of SS4 protein than wild-type plants (Fig. S8).. Second, we examined growth and starch metabolism of heterozygous (SS4ss4-3) plants. As expected, both mature and immature leaves had approximately half the SS4 protein content of wild-type plants (Figs7, S9). Heterozygous plants were statistically significantly different from ss4 mutant plants but not from wild-type plants with respect to FW, starch granule size distribution, granule volume, starch content and turnover in mature and immature leaves, and mean stromal area per starch granule (measured on light micrographs of leaf sections) (Figs7, S9). Thus, loss of half of the SS4 protein does not affect granule formation.. . Figure 7. . Starch characteristics of heterozygous (SS4ss4) Arabidopsis plants.
