Results. . Phenotypes of the pgr7 mutant. The pgr7 mutant was isolated as a low NPQ mutant from fast neutron-mutated M2 plants by digital video imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence. Under actinic illumination, the chlorophyll fluorescence was quickly quenched in the wild type (Ler), whereas the pgr7 mutant emitted higher levels of chlorophyll fluorescence throughout the 30 sec illumination (Figure 1A). Further chlorophyll fluorescence measurements showed that pgr7 exhibited much less NPQ than the wild type during a 10 min actinic illumination (Figure 1B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011688.g001. Figure 1. . Low nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ) phenotype of the pgr7 mutant.. A) Digital video images of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching in pgr7 and wild type, Ler. Seedlings on MS agar plates were dark-adapted for 30 min and then were illuminated with actinic light (500 mol photons m-2 s-1). Chlorophyll fluorescence images were captured by using a CCD camera with a far-red transmitting filter [13]. Images captured at the onset of illumination (0 sec) and at 10, 20 and 30 sec are shown. B) NPQ values in pgr7 and Ler. NPQ values were measured using an FMS2 fluorometer during actinic illumination with 1200 mol photons m-2 s-1 for 10 min, followed by relaxation in the dark for 5 min. Each data point represents the mean  SD (n=4).. . . . Besides the low NPQ, the pgr7 mutant is smaller than the wild type (Ler). When pgr7 was grown photoautotrophically on minimal agar medium, the mutant seedlings were smaller than Ler, although the color of the leaves was indistinguishable between the mutant and the wild type (Figure 2A). Similarly, there were differences in plant size between pgr7 and Ler grown directly on soil in a short-day condition for 4 weeks (Figure 2B) or 8 weeks (Figure 2C) and in a long-day condition (data not shown). In addition, soil-grown pgr7 plants were slightly pale green compared to the wild type. As expected, the chlorophyll content in pgr7 was significantly (P<0.01) lower than that of wild type, however there was no significant difference in chlorophyll a to b ratio (Table 1).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011688.g002.

To understand the basis for the low NPQ in the pgr7 mutant, we sought to determine whether any previously identified NPQ factors were affected in the pgr7 mutant by comparing pgr7 and Ler plants grown on soil. To assess whether photosynthetic electron transport is affected in the pgr7 mutant, we measured two key chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, the quantum yield of PSII (phiPSII) and the reduction state of PSII (1-qL), as a function of light intensity (Figure 3). Although both pgr7 and Ler had an optimal value of the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) (Table 1) [10], the phiPSII values in pgr7 were significantly (P<0.05) lower than in wild type in the light (Figure 3A), reflecting a reduced rate of electron transport through PSII in pgr7. By measuring 1-qL, we also found significant changes in the redox state of the first stable electron acceptor of PSII, QA, which reflects the redox state of the plastoquinone pool. The 1-qL in pgr7 was much higher than that of the wild type at all light intensities, even at the growth light intensity (150 mol photons m-2 s-1) (Figure 3B). These results indicate that electron transport is restricted in pgr7 at some point after QA in PSII.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011688.g003. Figure 3. . Light responses of phiPSII, 1-qL and deltaA/deltaAmax in the pgr7 mutant.. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and P700+ absorbance were measured from attached rosette leaves during a 5 min illumination with each of the corresponding light intensities. Each data point is the mean  SD (n=3 except for n=6 of pgr7 in C). A) Quantum yield of PSII (phiPSII) of pgr7 and Ler. B) Reduction state of PSII (1-qL) in pgr7 and Ler. C) Redox state of the reaction center chlorophylls of PSI (P700). deltaA/deltaAmax was determined by absorbance changes at 820 nm.. . . . To clarify the defective point in the electron transport, light-intensity dependence of P700 oxidation was determined in pgr7 and was compared with that in the wild type and pgr5 (Figure 3C). The pgr5 mutant is defective in PSI cyclic electron transport, which is essential for the induction of NPQ via its role in generating deltapH [9]. In the wild type, P700 is completely reduced in the dark and becomes more oxidized during a series of increasing light intensities. The defect in PSI cyclic electron transport caused the reduction of P700 at higher light intensities in pgr5. In contrast, P700 in the pgr7 mutant was more oxidized relative to the wild type at higher light intensities (Figure 3C). This result suggests that photosynthetic electron transport in pgr7 is restricted between QA of PSII and P700 of PSI.. A lower rate of electron transport might be expected to affect the generation of a high deltapH and activation of the xanthophyll cycle enzyme, VDE, in the thylakoid lumen. The pH-dependent conversion of V to A and Z by VDE is necessary for full induction of NPQ [11], [12], [13], and the de-epoxidation state [(A+Z)/(V+A+Z)] is strongly correlated with NPQ [14]. To determine the de-epoxidation state, leaf disks of pgr7 and Ler were exposed to high light (1100 mol photons m-2 s-1) for 5, 10, 30 and 60 min, and the amounts of V, A, and Z were determined using HPLC. Both pgr7 and Ler contained similar amounts of xanthophyll cycle pigments (V+A+Z) per leaf area (Table 1). During exposure to high light, there were no differences in the overall de-epoxidation state between pgr7 and Ler (Figure 4A), indicating that pgr7 contains a functional xanthophyll cycle. However, there were differences in the relative levels of Z and A in pgr7 and Ler. In Ler, Z/(V+A+Z) was much higher than A/(V+A+Z) at 10 min or more of high light treatment (Figure 4B). In contrast, in pgr7, Z/(V+A+Z) and A/(V+A+Z) were almost identical at 30 min (Figure 4C), and at 60 min, Z/(V+A+Z) was slightly higher than A/(V+A+Z) in pgr7, although the difference was smaller than that in Ler. Thus, the composition of the de-epoxidated xanthophyll cycle pigments was different between pgr7 and Ler under high light, although there was no difference in the overall de-epoxidation state [(A+Z)/(V+A+Z)] (Figure 4).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011688.g004. Figure 4. . Characterization of the xanthophyll cycle in pgr7.. The composition of the xanthophyll cycle pigments (Violaxanthin: V; Antheraxanthin; A; Zeaxanthin: Z) was determined in low light (LL: 150 mol photons m-2 s-1) (0) and after being treated in high light (HL: 1100 mol photons m-2 s-1) for 5 min (5), 10 min (10), 30 min (30) and 60 min (60). Each data point represents the mean of three measurements with SD. A) De-epoxidation state [(A+Z)/(V+A+Z)] of pgr7 and Ler. B) A (closed triangles) and Z (open squares) levels in Ler. C) A (closed triangles) and Z (open squares) levels in pgr7.. . . . To investigate the mechanism by which the pgr7 mutation partially impairs electron transport between QA and P700, the accumulation of major photosynthetic complexes was compared between pgr7 and the wild type. Immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies raised against the D1 subunit of the PSII reaction center, the PsaA subunit of the PSI reaction center, cytochrome f (cytochrome b6f complex) and RbcL (large subunit of Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) showed that all the complexes accumulated in pgr7 as in the wild type (Figure 5). We conclude that PGR7 is not essential for the accumulation of a major photosynthetic complex. Plastocyanin, the soluble electron carrier between the cytochrome b6f complex and PSI, also accumulated to the wild-type level in pgr7 (Figure 5).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011688.g005. Figure 5. . Immunoblot analysis of photosynthetic proteins.. Photosynthetic proteins were detected using specific antibodies against D1 (PSII), PsaA (PSI), Cyt f (Cytochrome b6f complex), RbcL (the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), and plastocyanin (PC). The lanes were loaded with chloroplast membranes equivalent to 0.4 g chlorophyll (100%) from the wild type and pgr7, along with a series of dilutions of the wild-type sample.. . . . . . Positional cloning of PGR7. To determine the genetic basis for the phenotypes of pgr7, we determined the segregation ratio of wild type to mutant in F2 plants of wild type x pgr7. Using digital video imaging, 115 progeny showed a wild-type phenotype, and 29 had a low NPQ phenotype among 144 F2 seedlings tested. In addition, the plant size and pigmentation phenotypes of pgr7 cosegregated with the low NPQ phenotype (data not shown). A G-test determined that wild type to mutant phenotype ratio in F2 plants fitted to a 31 ratio (chi2=1.90, P=0.168) [15]. These results indicate that the mutant phenotypes of pgr7 are caused by a recessive mutation in a single nuclear locus.. The affected gene in pgr7 was identified by positional cloning. The mapping population plants were selected from the F2 plants resulting from crosses with a polymorphic wild-type strain (Col-0). Using simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers, we found that the pgr7 mutation is located between NGA162 and GAPAB on chromosome 3 (Figure 6A). For fine mapping, we developed additional polymorphic markers based on the sequence polymorphisms published in the Monsanto Arabidopsis Polymorphism and Ler Sequence Collection [16]. Genotyping results with these markers mapped the pgr7 mutation between the MSA6c and MIL23d markers, which flank a region of genomic DNA defined by almost three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (Figure 6A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011688.g006. Figure 6. . Cloning of the PGR7 gene and complementation of pgr7.. A) Positional cloning of PGR7. The horizontal line at the top represents chromosome 3 with marker names above and numbers below showing distances (in cM) from the corresponding marker to the PGR7 gene. Numbers in parentheses are the number of recombinants detected. Bars represent BAC clones and the positions of genes encoding predicted chloroplast proteins are displayed with triangles. B) Partial DNA sequence of the At3g21200 gene in pgr7 and Ler. The lower and upper cases indicate an intron and an exon region, respectively. The position of the transversion (C  G) in pgr7 and the resulting stop codon are underlined. C) Complementation of the low NPQ phenotype of pgr7 by the At3g21200 gene. In the pseudo-color image, wild-type level of NPQ is displayed as green and low NPQ as blue. The agarose gel image shows genotype results determined by the dCAPS marker C21200d.. . . . Within the region, many of the 45 annotated genes encode unknown proteins, and only a few of them were previously characterized or similar to known proteins. The phenotypes of the pgr7 mutant strongly suggested that the PGR7 gene might encode a chloroplast protein, so we identified seven candidate genes encoding predicted chloroplast proteins and determined their genomic DNA sequences in the pgr7 mutant. The chloroplast localization was predicted by the ChloroP program [17]. Following sequence alignments of the wild type with the mutant, we found a C to G change in the At3g21200 gene of pgr7 (Figure 6B). The mutation occurred in an exon and resulted in a change of a TCA codon encoding serine (residue 234 of 317, including the putative chloroplast transit peptide) to a TGA stop codon in pgr7. This nonsense mutation would shorten the At3g21200 protein in the pgr7 mutant by 84 amino acid residues at the C-terminal end (Figure 6B).. To confirm that the nonsense mutation in At3g21200 is responsible for the low NPQ phenotype in pgr7, we performed a complementation experiment by introducing the wild-type At3g21200 gene with its native upstream and downstream sequences into the pgr7 mutant. We also developed a molecular marker, C21200d, to differentiate between the wild-type and mutant alleles. The results showed that all transformants contained both the mutant and the wild-type alleles of At3g21200, and the low NPQ phenotype of pgr7 was returned to a wild-type level of NPQ (Figure 6C). In addition, the plant size of pgr7 was restored to that of the wild type (Figure 6C). After transplantation into soil, the complemented plants were as green as Ler (data not shown). Therefore, we were able to confirm that the mutation in At3g21200 is responsible for the mutant phenotypes of pgr7.. . . Chloroplast localization of PGR7. PGR7 was predicted to be a chloroplast protein, and it was detected by proteomics analysis of a chloroplast stroma fraction in Arabidopsis [18]. To confirm the chloroplast localization of PGR7, we examined the localization of a fusion with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The N-terminal 41 amino acids were predicted to be a plastid-targeting signal by ChloroP. A DNA construct encoding an in-frame fusion of the first 115 amino acids of PGR7 with GFP was introduced into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts, and then the subcellular localization of the green fluorescence was compared with that of chlorophyll autofluorescence using a confocal microscope (Figure 7). The green fluorescence emitted from the PGR7-GFP fusion protein colocalized with the chlorophyll fluorescence (Figures 7A-7C), showing that the fusion protein is targeted to chloroplasts. A very similar pattern was observed previously for another chloroplast protein, CpIscA [19]. In contrast, the green fluorescence from the GFP protein alone, without the PGR7 N-terminus, was observed only outside of chloroplasts (Figures 7D-7F). These results indicate that the PGR7 N-terminus contains a signal for chloroplast localization.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011688.g007. Figure 7. . Chloroplast localization of a PGR7 N-terminus-GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts.. The protoplasts were transformed with either p21TPG3 encoding the PGR7 N-terminus-GFP fusion protein (A, B and C) or, as a control, p35omega-SGFP(S65T) encoding GFP itself (D, E and F). The green fluorescence images (A and D) were overlaid with chlorophyll autofluorescence images (B and E) to generate merged ones (C and F). The bar represents 10 m.. . . . In addition, we complemented the pgr7 mutation by expression of a full-length PGR7 protein with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the C-terminus, under control of the 35S promoter. Immunoblot analysis of isolated chloroplasts and stromal and thylakoid membrane fractions revealed that the HA-tagged PGR7 protein is located in chloroplasts, predominantly in the stromal fraction (Figure 8), consistent with the available proteomics data [18]. A relatively small amount of HA-tagged PGR7 was also detected in thylakoids, similar to the distribution of the stromal protein RbcL but distinctly different from the thylakoid protein cytochrome f (Figure 8).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011688.g008. Figure 8. . Chloroplast localization of an HA-tagged PGR7 protein.. Immunoblot analysis of the HA epitope, cytochrome f (Cyt f), and RbcL was performed with proteins solubilized from leaves, chloroplasts, thylakoids, and stroma of the wild type and the pgr7 mutant complemented with a PGR7:HA construct.. . . . . . Identification of conserved domains and homologs of PGR7. The PGR7/At3g21200 gene model was confirmed by full-length cDNAs (GenBank accessions AY062654, AY087867 and BT002574). BLAST searches with the full-length protein sequence revealed the existence of homologs in vascular plants, the moss Physcomitrella patens, green algae (including Micromonas sp., Ostreococcus sp., and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), diatoms, and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae, as well as distant homologs in other eukaryotes, many bacteria, and archaea.. Further bioinformatic analyses indicated that the mature PGR7 protein consists of two globular domains (Figure 9A), each having a distinct taxonomic distribution and three-dimensional structure. One domain, which spans residues 58 to 174, contains a predicted FMN-binding split barrel (IPR009002) (Figure 8A). This FMN-binding domain was previously detected in At3g03890 (UniProt accession Q8LDU1), which is one of three homologs of PGR7 that are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome. The second domain (residues 196 to 285) is a conserved domain of unknown function (PFAM DUF2470; IPR019595) that is also found in a family of cyanobacterial proteins. These cyanobacterial matches were also found by PSI-BLAST on the second iteration, and they appear to be single-domain proteins whose homology is restricted to the DUF2470 region of PGR7; thus, they lack the putative FMN-binding domain.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011688.g009. Figure 9. . Identified domains and phylogenetic analysis of PGR7.. A) Possible functional domains identified through Hidden Markov Model (HMM) construction and the positions of the FMN-binding split barrel domain and the DUF2470 domain in PGR7. B) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of PGR7 homologs in selected plants and green algae. A conserved region of PGR7 (residues 58-263) was used to identify 160 global homologs from plants, green algae, and bacteria in the UniProt database. The sequences were aligned, and a phylogenetic tree was generated with midpoint rooting. A branch of the larger tree (see Figure S1) that contains the plant and green algal sequences (with UniProt accession numbers) is shown here. The numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values from 100 runs.. . . . Because orthologs are most informative when they share a common overall domain architecture [20], we gathered homologs from the UniProt database and constructed a phylogenetic tree for an evolutionarily conserved region (residues 58 to 263) spanning the predicted FMN-binding split barrel domain and most of the DUF2470 domain (Figure S1). This analysis included 160 homologs with the same domain architecture from plants, green algae (but not other algae), and bacteria. A branch of the maximum likelihood tree containing PGR7 and 34 homologs from plants and green algae is shown in Figure 9B. Orthologs of PGR7 were evident in vascular plants, Physcomitrella, and Micromonas, whereas additional homologs were found in these species plus Ostreococcus and Chlamydomonas.. PSI-BLAST analysis also detected homology to several proteins with X-ray crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For example, PDB structure 2ARZ is a hypothetical protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa detected by PSI-BLAST on the second iteration with an E-value of 7e-20 (15% identity and 34% positives). The region of homology detected by PSI-BLAST spans the length of PGR7 (excepting the predicted chloroplast transit peptide). Examination of the structure of 2ARZ shows two domains, a beta-barrel domain in the first half of the protein and a second domain that has a three-stranded antiparallel beta sheet and two helices..
