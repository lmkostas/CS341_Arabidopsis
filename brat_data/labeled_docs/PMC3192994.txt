Results. . The five VDAC isoforms present in A. thaliana. Five Arabidopsis VDAC isoforms, VDAC1 (At3g01280), VDAC2 (At5g67500), VDAC3 (At5g15090), VDAC4 (At5g57490), and VDAC5 (At3g49920), which exhibit high identity (ranging from 68% to 50%), can be extracted from the GenBank database. VDACs are known as beta-strand-rich proteins (Abrecht et al., 2000; Colombini, 2009). Using the FORTE program (Tomii and Akiyama, 2004; http://www.cbrc.jp/forte), the VDAC1-VDAC4 proteins were, like human VDACs, predicted to contain 19 transmembrane (TM) beta-strand domains (Fig. 1B and data not shown). VDAC5 is assumed to encode the truncated protein that lacks the sixth to ninth TM domains (data not shown). The eukaryotic MPS found in VDACs (Young et al., 2007) is positioned in the 15-17th TM domains (Fig. 1B). Of the five Arabidopsis VDACs, VDAC1 and VDAC3 contain the canonical MPS motif in their C-terminal region, whereas VDAC2, VDAC4, and VDAC5 contain divergent MPS sequences (Fig. 1A).. The next step was to try detect the VDAC transcripts from A. thaliana accession Col-0. Of the five VDAC genes, it was not possible to isolate a sequence identical to the VDAC5 sequence published in the public database. The fragments amplified from reverse-transcribed cDNAs were three kinds of splicing variants of VDAC5 and their deduced amino acid sequences were truncated (data not shown). It was thus assumed that VDAC5 is a pseudo-gene. Henceforth, all of the VDAC genes present in Arabidopsis were characterized, excluding VDAC5.. . . Subcellular localization of VDACs. The subcellular localization of Arabidopsis VDACs in plant cells was examined using constructs consisting of GFP fused to the C-terminal regions of VDAC1-VDAC4. These VDAC-GFP fusion constructs were delivered into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment or into protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis leaves by PEG treatment (Fig. 2). VDAC1-GFP and VDAC3-GFP were exclusively detected in mitochondria (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the green fluorescence signals of VDAC2-GFP and VDCA4-GFP were detected not only in mitochondria, but also in another subcellular area (Fig. 2A). The mitochondrial targeting of the VDAC-GFP constructs was confirmed by a mitochondria-localized fluorescence fusion protein consisting of the truncated F0F1ATPase gamma-subunit and intact fluorescent mCherry protein delivered into onion epidermal cells (Fig. 2B). As previously mentioned, VDAC1 and VDAC3 contain the conserved MPS sequence in their C-termini, whereas VDAC2 and VDAC4 do not (Fig. 1A). It was assumed that the canonical MPS sequence is important for strict targeting to mitochondria. To test this possibility, the following constructs were generated: the MPS regions (amino acid positions 219-241) of VDAC1 and VDAC2 were named M1 and m2, respectively, and the M1 of VDAC1 was replaced with m2, resulting in VDAC1-m2-GFP (Fig. 2C). Conversely, the m2 of VDAC2 was replaced with M1, resulting in VDAC2-M1-GFP (Fig. 2C). The chimeric constructs were similarly introduced into Arabidopsis protoplasts. GFP fluorescence of VDAC1-m2-GFP was observed in a pattern similar to VDAC2-GFP or VDAC4-GFP, whereas VDAC2-M1-GFP localized primarily to mitochondria, as did VDAC1-GFP or VDAC3-GFP (Fig. 2D). Next, experiments were carried out to try to establish whether a specific amino acid residue of M1 determines the strict mitochondrial localization of VDAC1. Based on a comparison of the conserved MPS sequences with those of M1 and m2, it was hypothesized that the proline at amino acid position 223 of M1 is a possible candidate residue for determining mitochondrial localization (Fig. 1). The corresponding residue of m2 is histidine. Thus, a construct that encoded VDAC1 with the m2-specific residue at position 223 (i.e. VDAC1P223H-GFP) and one that encoded VDAC2 with the M1-specific residue at position 223 (i.e. VDAC2H223P-GFP) were generated by means of site-directed mutagenesis. As expected, VDAC1P223H had the properties of VDAC2 in terms of cellular localization, whereas VDAC2H223P localized primarily to mitochondria, as did VDAC1 (Fig. 2D).. . Fig. 2.. .

(C) Schematic diagram of intact VDAC1 and 2, and of the chimeric proteins produced. In VDAC1, the conserved MPS motif (referred to as M1 in this study) spans from amino acid residue 219 to 241. VDAC2 contains the divergent sequence (referred to as m2 in this study). Swapped chimeras of the MPS regions of VDAC1 and VDAC2 were constructed. In VDAC1-m2, the M1 region of VDAC1 was replaced with the m2 region of VDAC2. In VDAC2-M1, the m2 region of VDAC2 was replaced with M1.

Spatiotemporal analysis of the expression of four VDAC genes. As a step toward determining the functional sites of the four VDAC genes in planta, transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying the respective VDAC promoter-GUS constructs were generated, and the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the reporter gene was evaluated. The VDAC1 promoter was active in shoot meristems and the surrounding regions (Fig. 3A), corresponding to the root meristematic zone, but not in root caps (Fig. 3B), lateral roots (Fig. 3C), the entire leaf area (Fig. 3D), and the stigma and anthers (Fig. 3E). The activity of the VDAC2 promoter was constitutively elevated in the above-ground parts of the plant (Fig. 3F) and in the root tips (Fig. 3G) and steles (Fig. 3H). The activity was detected in whole leaves of the plants which had developed further (Fig. 3I) and in whole flower organs, including sepals (Fig. 3J). VDAC3 promoter activity was scarcely detected in leaves, except for the leaf tips (Fig. 3K-M), and rather strong activity was detected in the anthers and stigma (Fig. 3N). The VDAC4 promoter was constitutively active in whole seedlings (Fig. 3O) and in almost all organs (Fig. 3P-S).. . Fig. 3.. .

Characterization of VDAC T-DNA insertion mutant lines. To dissect the function of VDAC genes genetically, four T-DNA insertion alleles of VDAC1, one of VDAC2, two of VDAC3, and one of VDAC4 were investigated (Fig. 4A). Of these, five lines (i.e. vdac1-6, vdac2-2, vdac3-2, vdac3-3, and vdac4-2) were obtained as homozygotes (Fig. 4B-E), whereas vdac1-3 and vdac1-5 were only obtained as heterozygotes. The level of the respective VDAC transcripts in the homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant plant was measured by RT-PCR using primer pairs which correspond to the 5 region of the T-DNA insertion sites and which span the T-DNA insertion sites, respectively. VDAC transcripts were detected when the 5-side primer pairs were used, but null or reduced levels of the transcripts were detected when the primers spanning the T-DNA insertion sites were used (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the RNA expression levels were quantified using the 3-side primers of T-DNA insertions by quantitative real-time PCR. VDAC1 or VDAC4 expression was totally suppressed in vdac1-6 or vdac4-2 plants, and VDAC2 or VDAC3 expression decreased to 27% or 23% in vdac2-2 or vdac3-3, respectively, compared with that of the WT (Fig. 4D).. .

(G) RT-PCR analysis of three PR genes. AtAct2 is used as a loading control.. . . . The growth rates of vdac1-6 and vdac3-3 are comparable with those of the WT (Col-0) but, interestingly, two of the mutants (vdac2-2 and vdac4-2) exhibited retarded growth rates and had a miniature phenotype compared with the WT throughout development (Fig. 4E). In addition, both mutants (vadc2-2, and vdac4-2) showed a lesion mimic phenotype (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, up-regulation of the pathogenesis-related genes PR1, PR2, and PR5 was observed in vdac2-2 and vdac4-2, but not in vdac1-6 and vdac3-3, under normal conditions (Fig. 4G).. VDAC is known as an outer mitochondrial membrane component of the permeability transition (PT) pore, and the PT pore participates in the regulation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (Kusano et al., 2009). To establish why these mutant plants exhibited diverse phenotypes, the MMP of the protoplasts prepared from the mutant plants was examined using Rhodamine123. In all of the vdac mutants tested, the MMP values were lower (mean value of vdac1-6, 64%; vdac2-2, 39%; vdac3-3, 67%; vdac4-2, 51%) than those of the WT (Fig. 5A, B). Loss of function of VDAC2 or VDAC4 resulted in a greater loss of MMP values than did loss of function of VDAC1 or VDAC3 (Fig. 5A, B).. . Fig. 5.. .

These experiments were replicated three times.. . . . . . Possible function of VDAC genes during the reproductive stages. Self-crossing of the heterozygotes of vdac1-3 and vdac1-5 did not result in a vdac1/vdac1 genotype in the progeny (Table 1). In vdac1-6, the T-DNA was inserted in the most 3-distal region of VDAC1 of all the insertion mutants tested, and the homozygous vdac1-6 line could set seeds in siliques that were slender compared with those of the WT (Col-0) (Fig. 6A-C). Moreover, the pollen germination rate of vdac1-6 was 27% lower compared with the WT, and germinated pollen tube length was also affected in vdac1-6 (Fig. 6E, F). Apparently, vdac1-6 and vdac3-3 did not show any growth retardation compared with the WT, whereas vdac2-2 and vdac4-2 grew at half the rate, taking at least a few weeks more to reach the flowering stage (Fig. 6A). The siliques of the vdac2-2 and vdac4-2 homozygous lines were short compared with those of the WT (Fig. 6B, C), but they did not set fertile seeds. Anther maturation in the vdac2-2 and vdac4-2 homozygous lines appeared to be disturbed, and their anthers contained fewer pollen grains than those of the WT (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, the germination rate of pollen obtained from vdac2-2 and vdac4-2 was reduced about one-eighth and germinated pollen tubes were also drastically shorter than those of the WT (Fig. 6E, F).. .

To examine the relationship between VDAC function and defence activity against the bacterial pathogen Pst, the expression profiles of VDAC genes during pathogen infection were analysed using quantitative RT-PCR. All four VDAC members were up-regulated upon infection with the bacterial pathogen. The relative transcript levels of VDAC1 and VDAC3 were enhanced to a greater degree when plants were infected with the avirulence pathogen, Pst DC3000 (avrRpt2), than with the virulence pathogen, Pst DC3000 (Fig. 7A). Next, the growth of Pst DC3000 and its derivative, Pst DC3000 (avrRpt2), was tested in the VDAC loss-of-function mutant plants. Here, two mutant plants were used, vdac1-6 and vdac3-3, since the other two mutants, vdac2-2 and vdac4-2, were too small to infiltrate with the bacterial solution and constitutively expressed PR genes (Fig. 4E, G). The host defence activity against Pst DC3000 (avrRpt2), but not against Pst DC3000, was compromised in vdac1-6 plants compared with control plants at 48h post-inoculation (Fig. 7B, C). This phenomenon was not observed in vdac3-3 plants (Fig. 7B, C). This result indicates that VDAC1 is involved in plant defence against the avirulence pathogen Pst DC3000 (avrRpt2). Next, the production of H2O2 in vdac1-6 plants upon Pst DC3000 (avrRpt2) infection was compared with that in the pathogen-infected WT. The amount of H2O2 in vdac1-6 plants was less than half of that produced by the WT at 9h post-inoculation (Fig. 7D). When Arabidopsis WT plants were challenged with Pst DC3000 (avrRpt2), the HR was induced and cell death was observed around the inoculation sites. Therefore, experiments were carried out to examine whether similar cell death occurred when vdac1-6 and vdac3-3 leaves were infiltrated with Pst DC3000 (avrRpt2) (inoculation size, 5106 cfu ml-1). While cell death was observed in the majority of WT leaves by 20-24h post-bacterial inoculation, cell death was seldom observed in vdac1-6 plants at the same time points (Fig. 7E). In the WT, 58 leaves exhibited clear cell death (C-CD; Fig. 7E, left), 21 leaves exhibited weak cell death (W-CD), and two leaves showed no cell death (N-CD) symptoms. The corresponding ratio in vdac1-6 was six (C-CD), to 60 (W-CD; Fig. 7E, right), to 16 (N-CD). In contrast, this phenomenon was not observed in vdac3-3 plants (Fig. 7F). These findings suggest that the loss of function of VDAC1 suppresses the activation of cell death.. . Fig. 7.. . Involvement of VDAC1 in the defence response against bacterial pathogens.
