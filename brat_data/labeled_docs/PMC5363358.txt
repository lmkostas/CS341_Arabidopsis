Results. The 1a3b mutant of Arabidopsis provided a suitable genotype for examining the influence of heterologous SSUs on leaf photosynthesis and growth. Some aspects of the 1a3b mutant phenotype may reflect loss of distinct Rubisco isoforms (i.e. forms with different SSU compositions), as well as loss of total Rubisco activity. As a first step to evaluate this possibility, a second mutant, lacking expression of rbcS1A and a different minor SSU, rbcS2B (the 1a2b mutant) was included in some of the analyses. Quantification of T-DNA copy numbers indicated that neither double mutant contained T-DNA insertions other than those at their respective rbcS loci.. . Design and targeting of native and heterologous SSUs. Binary vectors were generated to express either the full-length native Arabidopsis rbcS1A (1AAt), the mature Chlamydomonas rbcS2N-terminally fused to the chloroplast TP sequence from Arabidopsis rbcS1A (S2Cr), or the full-length Arabidopsis rbcS1A modified to contain alpha-helices matching the amino acid sequence as those of the Chlamydomonas SSU family (1AAtMOD) (Fig.1; Notes S1). Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis SSU alpha-helices have the same number of amino acids, but differ in terms of chemical composition. Expression of the introduced proteins was driven by the promoter of Arabidopsis rbcS1A, which has the highest expression level of the Arabidopsis rbcS genes (Izumi etal., 2012).. To check the subcellular locations of introduced SSUs, they were initially generated as C-terminal fusions to GFP and transiently expressed in leaves of N.benthamiana. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that all three fusion proteins were located in the chloroplast stroma (Fig.S1). Untagged SSUs were then stably expressed in the Arabidopsis 1a3b mutant.. . . Expression levels, leaf protein and Rubisco content of native and heterologous SSU isoforms. In wild-type plants, rbcS1A transcripts were the most abundant (43% of the rbcS pool), followed by rbcS3B (28%), rbcS2B (21%) and rbcS1B (8%) (Fig.2; TableS2). The 1a3b mutant had no detectable transcript for rbcS1A and much reduced levels of transcript for rbcS3B (c. 10% of wild-type levels). Both rbcS1A and rbcS2B transcripts were below the level of detection in the 1a2b mutant. In the 1a3b mutant, transcript levels for the two undisrupted rbcS genes, rbcS1B and rbcS2B, were 50 and 170% of those in wild-type plants, respectively. In the 1a2b mutant, rbcS1B and rbcS3B transcript levels were 120 and 140% of those in wild-type plants, respectively. For both mutants, transcript levels for rbcL (ATCG00490) and for the overall rbcS pool were 50% of those in wild-type plants.. . Figure 2. . Transcript abundances of the Rubisco gene family in rbcs mutants and transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. Abundances of rbcS1A (At1g67090), rbcS1B (At5g38430), rbcS2B (At5g38420), rbcS3B (At5g38410) and rbcL (Atcg00490) transcripts were quantified relative to wild-type levels (set at 100) from 28-d-old rosettes using RT-qPCR with gene-specific primers (Supporting Information TableS1). For wild-type, 1a3b and 1a2b values are the meansSE of measurements made on three individual 28-d-old rosettes. For transgenic lines values are meansSE of measurements made on nine rosettes, three from each of the three lines. Full expression data are shown in TableS2. HET, heterologous rbcS.. . . . For each of the three transgenic genotypes expressing native or heterologous SSUs in the 1a3b mutant background, at least six independent lines segregated in the T2 generation. Transgenic plants were screened for faster growth rates and maximum quantum yield of PSII (measured by dark-adapted leaf fluorescence; F. v/F. m) compared to the 1a3b mutant (Fig.S2). For further analysis, homozygous T3 lines for each genotype were selected from the three best-performing T2 segregating lines.. For each line of each transgenic genotype, transcript levels for the inserted transgene were comparable to those of the native rbcS1A gene in wild-type plants (Fig.2; TableS2). Levels of transcript of the undisrupted native Rubisco genes were altered in these lines relative to wild-type plants. For rbcL, transcript levels were higher in transgenic than in 1a3b mutant plants, and in at least one independent line for each construct they were as high as in wild-type plants. As in 1a3b mutants, transcript levels for rbcS2B in transgenic plants were generally higher than those in wild-type plants (Fig.2; TableS2).. The leaf Rubisco content in the 1a3b and 1a2b mutants was reduced by 70 and 50%, respectively, relative to wild-type plants (Fig.3a). Total soluble protein content in leaves of the mutants was also c. 60% of wild-type values in both cases. This reduction was larger than could be accounted for by the reduction in Rubisco content alone (Fig.3b; TableS3).. . Figure 3. . Rubisco and protein contents in rbcs mutants and transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. Rubisco (a) and total protein contents (b) are shown for 32-d-old plants. Rubisco content was determined via 14C-CABP binding, and subunit ratios were estimated by immunoblotting. For wild-type, 1a3b and 1a2b values are the meansSE of measurements made on three individual rosettes. For transgenic lines values are meansSE of measurements made on nine rosettes, three from each of the three lines. (c) Representative immunoblots for wild-type plants and transgenic lines, probed with a serum containing polyclonal antibodies against Rubisco. Standard curves (0.1-2.4mug Rubisco) are shown for wild-type large subunit (LSU, 55kDa) and small subunits (SSUs, 14.8kDa), followed by protein amounts in different lines. Native LSU, SSU and heterologous SSUs (15.5 and 14kDa, respectively) are indicated by dark grey, light grey and white arrows, respectively. Quantification of soluble protein and Rubisco is shown in Supporting Information TableS3.. . . . Complementation of the 1a3b mutant restored total Rubisco to 75% of wild-type levels for 1AAt and 1AAtMOD lines, and to 65% of wild-type levels for S2Cr lines. Immunoblotting revealed that the heterologous SSUs 1AAtMOD and S2Cr had different mobilities on SDS-PAGE gels from the native SSUs (Fig.3c). This enabled quantification of the relative contributions of the LSU, the native SSUs and the heterologous SSUs to total Rubisco content (Fig.3a). There were no significant differences in the ratio of LSU to SSU protein between any of the lines tested (TableS3). The 1AAtMOD and S2Cr transgenic lines retained the same amount of native SSU (i.e. products of the rbcS1B and rbcS2B genes) as the 1a3b mutant. Heterologous SSU levels were 2.4-fold higher than native SSU levels in 1AAtMOD. By contrast, heterologous SSU levels were 1.4-fold lower than native SSU levels in S2Cr lines.. . . Rubisco activity in mutant and transgenic plants. The invitro catalytic properties of Rubisco from wild-type plants (Table1) were in good agreement with those of Galms etal. (2014). The catalytic properties of Rubisco from 1a3b and 1a2b mutants were comparable to values for Rubisco from wild-type plants. Rubisco from 1AAt lines had the same catalytic properties as Rubisco from wild-type plants. This was also true for 1AAtMOD lines, despite the modification to the Rubisco SSU in these plants. However, k. cat. c and S. C/O values were significantly lower for Rubisco from S2Cr lines than for Rubisco from wild-type plants.. . Table 1. .

Growth of transgenic lines was compared with that of (1) wild-type plants, (2) the parental 1a3b mutant and (3) representative nontransgenic 1a3b mutant lines selected as out-segregants from the T2 populations (Fig.4). Fresh and dry weights of the out-segregant mutant lines were the same as those of the parental 1a3b mutant at 28d (Fig.4c; TableS4). Out-segregant lines had lower rates of rosette expansion than the parental 1a3b mutant (Fig.4b), but this did not affect interpretation of the effects of the transgenes on growth.. . Figure 4. .

(b) Rosette expansion of homozygous transgenic and 1a3b out-segregant plants compared to that of wild-type and 1a3b mutant plants. (c) Fresh and dry weights were compared after 28d. For wild-type (WT), 1a3b and 1a2b values are the meansSE of measurements made on 10 individual rosettes. For transgenic lines values are meansSE of measurements made on 30 rosettes, 10 from each of the three lines. See Supporting Information TableS4 for full dataset. seg, segregating T3 wild-type.. . . . As reported previously, 1a3b mutants had very low growth rates (Izumi etal., 2012). All three transgenic genotypes had greater rates of rosette expansion than 1a3b lines, with 1AAt and 1AAtMOD having higher expansion rates than S2Cr (Fig.4b). The dry weight of 1AAt rosettes at 28d was on average 84% of that of wild-type plants, and was not significantly different from the wild-type for two of the three lines. For 1AAtMOD and S2Cr lines, dry weight was on average 75 and 56%, respectively, of that of wild-type plants. There was no significant difference in the ratio of dry weight to fresh weight between wild-type plants and transgenic lines. All three transgenic genotypes had higher leaf area to weight ratios (rosette area per unit fresh or dry weight) than 1a3b mutants, and were not significantly different in this respect from wild-type plants (TableS4).. Rosette expansion rates and fresh and dry weights in the 1a2b mutant were greater than in the 1a3b mutant, but lower than those of wild-type and transgenic lines (Fig.4c). The 1a2b mutant had a lower ratio of fresh to dry weight than the 1a3b mutant (TableS4). Although the specific leaf areas (rosette area per unit dry weight) of 1a2b and 1a3b mutants were comparable, rosette area per unit fresh weight was significantly higher in 1a2b than in 1a3b mutants.. . . Photosynthetic characteristics. At ambient CO2 and saturating light, all three transgenic genotypes had much higher rates of CO2 assimilation (A. max) than the 1a3b mutant (A/photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) curves, Fig.5a). A. max was similar to that of wild-type plants in 1AAt and 1AAtMOD lines but lower in S2Cr lines (Table2). A. max was higher in the 1a2b than in the 1a3b mutant, and was comparable in 1a2b and S2Cr lines. The apparent quantum efficiency (phi) for all three transgenic lines was higher than in the 1a3b mutant and comparable with the wild-type value. Light compensation point and respiration rate in the dark (R. d) were the same in all lines.. . Figure 5. .

For measurements of net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A)/photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), relative humidity was maintained at 684% and ambient CO2 levels at 400mumolmol-1. For measurements of A/sub-stomatal CO2 concentration (C. i), relative humidity was maintained at 731% under a constant illumination of 1500mumolphotonsm-2s-1. All measurements were performed at 20C. Values are the meanSE of measurements made on four leaves, each from a different plant (as shown in Fig.5) followed by letters indicating significant differences (P<0.05) as determined by ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD tests.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. . . There were substantial differences between the 1a3b mutant and the transgenic genotypes in the response of CO2 assimilation to changing external CO2 concentrations under saturating light (A/C. i curves, Fig.5b). Several photosynthetic parameters can be derived from A/C. i curves (Table2). The maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V. c,max) and maximum photosynthetic electron transport rate (J. max) were not significantly different between wild-type, 1AAt and 1AAtMOD plants, but were lower in S2Cr plants than in wild-type plants. The initial linear slope of the A/C. i curve (a measure of the carboxylation efficiency and activation state of Rubisco) was lower for transgenic genotypes than for wild-type plants due to reduced Rubisco content in the transgenic lines (Fig.3a). In the 1a2b mutant, V. c,max, J. max, the sub-stomatal CO2 compensation point (gamma) and the initial slope of the A/C. i curve were different from those of the 1a3b mutant, but similar to values for the S2Cr lines.. Gas exchange rates and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements under photorespiratory (ambient O2 (21%)) and nonphotorespiratory (low O2 (2%)) conditions were used to derive information about photorespiration (Table3). Gross CO2 assimilation rates (GA, CO2 assimilation in the absence of respiration) and NADPH production (estimated from the photosynthetic electron transport rate, J. NADPH) can together be used to estimate the ratio of Rubisco oxygenase to carboxylase activity (V. o/V. c) (Bellasio etal., 2014).. . Table 3. .

Arabidopsis thaliana plants (35-40d old) were measured under 300mumol photonsm-2s-1, and ambient CO2 of 300mumolmol-1 as in Bellasio etal. (2014). For wild-type, 1a3b and 1a2b values are the meansSE of measurements made on individual leaves from five different rosettes.

The transgenic genotypes had higher GA and J. NADPH values than the 1a3b mutant. Values for 1AAt and 1AAtMOD lines were similar to those of wild-type plants, but values for S2Cr lines were lower. GA and J. NADPH in the 1a2b mutant were higher than in the 1a3b mutant, and comparable with values for the S2Cr lines. There were no significant differences in V. o/V. c values between any of the lines, indicating that relative photorespiratory rates were similar across genotypes under the conditions used.. Chlorophyll content and dark-adapted F. v/F. m values in the transgenic lines and the 1a2b mutant were higher than in the 1a3b mutant, and were not significantly different from those of wild-type plants (TableS5). The 1a3b mutants had higher levels of NPQ than wild-type plants, but NPQ in transgenic genotypes was comparable with that of wild-type plants (Fig.6). By contrast, the NPQ value for the 1a2b mutant was lower than that of wild-type plants. NPQ has two components: fast relaxing quenching (qE: NPQfast) associated with photoprotection, and slow relaxing quenching (qI: NPQslow) associated with chronic photoinhibition (Walters & Horton, 1991). To calculate the contribution of these components in the mutant lines, NPQ was tracked following a period of high light (600mumolphotonsm2s-1 for 1h) and subsequent recovery in darkness (1h). qI was lower in both transgenic genotypes that in wild-type plants, but qE was elevated in the 1a3b mutant and reduced in the 1a2b mutant. The qE:qI ratio was higher in the 1a3b mutant but lower in the 1a2b mutant than in wild-type plants (TableS6).. . Figure 6. .
