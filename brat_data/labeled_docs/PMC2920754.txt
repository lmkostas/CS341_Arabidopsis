ResultsNuclear localization of AtSRT2Several HDACs are translocated to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Hollender and Liu 2008), which is consistent with their functions in modifying chromatin. AtSRT2 has seven predicted splice variants (see Supplementary Fig. S1A); however, only the third transcript (AtSRT2-CDS3), which lacks the two C-terminal exons, has been characterized (Pandey etal. 2002). We amplified the seven putative transcripts of AtSRT2 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and found that AtSRT2-CDS3 was the predominant splice variant (data not shown).Sequence analysis has demonstrated that AtSRT2-CDS3 contains a typical nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Pandey etal. 2002). To determine the subcellular localization of AtSRT2-CDS3, we fused AtSRT2-CDS3 in-frame to the 5 end of the green fluorescent protein (dGFP). The AtSRT2-CDS3-dGFP construct was introduced into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts by polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated DNA transfection (Yoo etal. 2007). Green fluorescence was detected in the whole cell transformed with the GFP control (Fig. 1, upper panel), whereas the AtSRT2-CDS3-dGFP fusion protein was expressed exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 1, lower panel), indicating that AtSRT2-CDS3 localizes to the nucleus.. Fig. 1Nuclear localization of AtSRT2-CDS3. Plasmids carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP control; upper panel) or AtSRT2-CDS3-GFP (bottom panel) were transformed into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Fluorescent images were taken at 16h after transfection. The nucleus was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Scale bar=10mum. The image is representative of experiments performed in triplicate.Expression profile of AtSRT2To determine the function of AtSRT2, we first evaluated its expression profile by fusing the AtSRT2 promoter to a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. The resulting construct (pAtSRT2-GUS) was transformed into Arabidopsis. Four independent transgenic lines with a single insertion were obtained, and GUS activity was detected in different organs and development stages (Fig. 2A-F). In particular, AtSRT2 promoter activity was high in roots (Fig. 2A, 2B), leaves (Fig. 2B, D) and flowers (Fig. 2E).. Fig. 2Expression profile of AtSRT2. beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detected by histochemistry in transgenic plants containing pAtSRT2-GUS. Typical GUS expression patterns are shown for (A) 3-day-old seedlings; (B) 6-day-old seedlings; (C) 12-day-old seedlings; (D) leaves from adult plants; (E) flowers; (F) siliques; (G) mock-treated leaves; and (H) leaves inoculated with PstDC3000. Scale bar=1mm. These images are representative of experiments performed in triplicate.To assess whether the expression of AtSRT2 is responsive to pathogen infection, we compared GUS activity in transgenic plants before and after virulent PstDC3000 inoculation. GUS activity was reduced after pathogen inoculation but not after mock treatment (Fig. 2G, H), which suggests that PstDC3000 infection represses AtSRT2 expression.Down-regulation of AtSRT2 by PstDC3000, inoculationThe down-regulation of AtSRT2 promoter activity by PstDC3000 infection (Fig. 2G, H) prompted us to evaluate the role of AtSRT2 in the plant basal defense. To gain more detailed insights into AtSRT2 expression upon PstDC3000 infection, we determined AtSRT2 mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR in PstDC3000-inoculated plants at different time points. As shown in Fig. 3A, pathogen infection markedly reduced AtSRT2 mRNA levels. Only about 30% of AtSRT2 transcripts remained at 24h after pathogen inoculation, which is consistent with our promoter activity assay results (Fig. 2).. Fig. 3AtSRT2 expression is repressed by pathogen infection. (A) Four-week-old WT Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were infiltrated with 10mM MgCl2 (open bars) or PstDC3000 (filled bars; OD600=0.2 in 10mM MgCl2). The infiltrated leaves were collected at the indicated time for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. (B) Four-week-old WT (Col-0), npr1-3 and NahG Arabidopsis plants were infiltrated with PstDC3000 (OD600=0.2 in 10mM MgCl2). The infiltrated leaves were collected at the indicated time for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. (C) Two-week-old WT (Col-0) seedlings grown on MS medium were untreated (open bars) or treated with 0.5mM salicylic acid (SA; filled bars). Seedlings were collected at the indicated time for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. UBQ10 was used as an internal control. Data represent the meanSD from four independent experiments. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05; **P<0.01.The SA-mediated signaling pathway regulated by NPR1 is one of the most important pathways in plant defense (Durrant and Dong 2004, Loake and Grant 2007). To assess the roles of SA and NPR1 in the pathogen-induced down-regulation of AtSRT2, we determined AtSRT2 mRNA levels in the npr1-3 mutant and SA-deficient NahG transgenic plants. As shown in Fig. 3B, AtSRT2 expression was still inhibited by PstDC3000 infection in npr1-3 mutants and NahG plants, indicating that AtSRT2 expression is not dependent on SA or NPR1. Consistent with this result, we also found that the AtSRT2 mRNA levels were not affected by exogenous SA treatment in WT plants (Fig. 3C).Disruption of AtSRT2 enhances plant basal defense and PR1 expressionTo characterize the functions of AtSRT2 invivo, we obtained a homozygous T-DNA insertion line (SALK_149295) for AtSRT2 from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). The precise insertion position was determined by PCR with primers specific to AtSRT2 and the T-DNA sequence, followed by sequencing of the PCR product. We found that SALK_149295 carries a T-DNA insertion in the second exon of AtSRT2 (see Supplementary Fig. S1A). AtSRT2 mRNA was not detected in the srt2 mutant by RT-PCR (see Supplementary Fig. S1B).The down-regulation of AtSRT2 by pathogen infection prompted us to investigate the potential role of AtSRT2 in regulating the plant basal defense. After inoculating the srt2 mutant and WT plants with PstDC3000, we compared bacterial growth rates. As shown in Fig. 4A, at 0day post-inoculation (dpi), srt2 and WT plants contained the same amount of PstDC3000, indicating equal initial bacterial doses. However, at 3dpi, the bacterial pathogen accumulated in the srt2 mutant was 10-fold lower than that of WT plants in three independent experiments, suggesting that the srt2 mutation enhanced the plant basal defense. PR genes have been widely used as markers of the plant basal defense system (Durrant and Dong 2004). We determined PR1 mRNA expression in PstDC3000-inoculated srt2 and WT plants by quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S2, PstDC3000 treatment induced PR1 expression strongly in both WT and mutant plants, and PR1 transcripts levels were higher in srt2 mutants at 3dpi compared with the WT.. Fig. 4The srt2 mutant is more resistant to pathogen infection. (A) WT (Col-0) plants and srt2 mutants were infiltrated with a suspension of PstDC3000 (OD600=0.0001 in 10mM MgCl2). Bacterial growth was determined at 0dpi (open bars) or 3dpi (filled bars). Each data point consisted of at least six samples. Error bars indicate the SD. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05. (B) Pathogen-induced PR1 expression. WT (Col-0) plats and srt2 mutants were infiltrated with a suspension of PstDC3000 (OD600=0.0001 in 10mM MgCl2). Total RNA was extracted at the time indicated for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. UBQ10 was used as internal control. Data represent the meanSD from three independent experiments. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05.Overexpression of AtSRT2-CDS3 compromises plant basal defense and PR1 expressionTo characterize further the function of AtSRT2 in the basal defense system, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress AtSRT2-CDS3. The AtSRT2-CDS3 full-length cDNA was cloned behind the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, and this construct was transformed into Arabidopsis plants. Three independent transgenic lines (OE2, OE7 and OE15) were chosen for further analysis. Our quantitative RT-PCR results revealed constitutively elevated expression of AtSRT2 in all the three transgenic plants, while the expression level of AtSRT2 in OE2 was lower than that in OE7 and OE15 (Fig. 5A).. Fig. 5Overexpression of AtSRT2-CDS3 attenuates the plant defense response. (A) AtSRT2 expression of 4-week-old WT (Col-0) and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. UBQ10 was used as an internal control. Data represent the meanSD from two independent experiments. (B) WT (Col-0) and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants were infiltrated with a suspension of PstDC3000 (OD600=0.0001 in 10mM MgCl2). Samples were taken at 0dpi (open bars) or 3dpi (filled bars) to determine bacterial growth. Each data point consisted of at least six samples. Error bars indicate the SD. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05. (C) Pathogen-induced PR1 expression. WT (Col-0) and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants (OE7 and OE15) were treated with a suspension of PstDC3000 (OD600=0.0001 in 10mM MgCl2). Inoculated leaves were collected for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. UBQ10 was used as internal control. Data represent the meanSD from three independent experiments. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05. (D) Two-week-old WT (Col-0), srt2 and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing (OE7 and OE15) Arabidopsis plants were treated with 0.5mM SA to induce PR1 expression. Total RNA was extracted at different time points for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. UBQ10 was used as internal control. Data represent the meanSD from two independent experiments.After PstDC3000 inoculation of plants, more bacterial pathogen was detected in the overexpressing transgenic lines compared with WT plants at 3dpi in three independent experiments (Fig. 5B), indicating that overexpression of AtSRT2-CDS3 made plants more susceptible to PstDC3000 infection. In addition, OE2 was susceptible to PstDC3000 at a similar level to that of OE7 and OE15, suggesting that pathogen susceptibility in overexpressing plants might be independent of the expression level of AtSRT2. Consistent with these findings, PR1 transcripts were reduced in the AtSRT2-overexpressing lines compared with WT plants (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S2). These results are consistent with our findings in the srt2 mutant. Thus, analysis of both loss-of-function AtSRT2 mutants and gain-of-function AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants indicates that AtSRT2 functions as a negative regulator in plant basal defense.Besides pathogen inoculation, we also analyzed SA-induced PR1 expression in WT, srt2 and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants to determine the mechanism by which AtSRT2 regulates the SA signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 5D, we did not see a significant difference in PR1 transcript levels among WT, srt2 mutant and overexpression plants, suggesting that AtSRT2 does not influence downstream gene expression in the presence of SA.AtSRT2 negatively regulates EDS5, PAD4 and SID2 expressionBiosynthesis of SA, which requires a series of enzymes, is an essential step in the plant defense against biotrophic pathogens (Shah 2003, Durrant and Dong 2004). We found that AtSRT2 repressed pathogen-induced PR1 expression but had little effect on SA-induced PR1 expression (Figs. 4B, 5C, D), suggesting that AtSRT2 is involved downstream of pathogen recognition but upstream of SA signaling. To better understand the role of AtSRT2 in SA biosynthesis in the plant basal defense system, we analyzed the expression of SA biosynthesis-related enzymes PAD4, EDS5 and SID2 under various conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, expression of PAD4, EDS5 and SID2 at 0dpi was higher in the srt2 mutant but lower in AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing lines compared with the WT, suggesting that these three genes are repressed by AtSRT2 even in the absence of pathogens. Treatment with PstDC3000 increased expression of PAD4, EDS5 and SID2, which is consistent with results of previous studies (Jirage etal. 1999, Wildermuth etal. 2001, Nawrath etal. 2002). Furthermore, pathogen-induced expression of all the three genes was significantly higher in srt2 plants but lower in AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants compared with the WT (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results indicate that AtSRT2 negatively regulates both basal and pathogen-induced expression of SA biosynthesis-related genes, possibly a determinant for its role in suppressing plant basal defense.. Fig. 6AtSRT2 negatively regulates EDS5, PAD4 and SID2 expression. Four-week-old WT (Col-0), srt2 and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing (OE7 and OE15) Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with PstDC3000 (OD600=0.2 in 10mM MgCl2). Total RNA was extracted at the indicated time points for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of PAD4, EDS5 and SID2. UBQ10 was used as an internal control. Data represent the meanSD from three independent experiments. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05, **P<0.01..
