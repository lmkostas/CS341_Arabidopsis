T2	Gene 118 124	AtMND1
T3	Phenotype 125 301	did not affect normal vegetative development but caused fragmentation and missegregation of chromosomes in male and female meiosis, formation of inviable gametes, and sterility
R1	Causation Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3	
T1	Gene 319 335	Atmnd1 Atspo11-1
#1	AnnotatorNotes T1	double mutant, two genes affected
T4	Phenotype 365 435	chromosome fragmentation in Atmnd1 was suppressed by loss of Atspo11-1
R2	Causation Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4
