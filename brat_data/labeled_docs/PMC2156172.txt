Results. . A T-DNA mutation in AtS1P demonstrates a role for this subtilisin-like serine protease gene in salt stress responses. Some of the important components of the ATF6-related ER stress response in mammalian cells are the stress sensor ATF6, chaperones such as BiP, and Golgi-located protein processing factors (Chen et al., 2002; Shen et al., 2002). A key processing factor is S1P, a subtilisin-like serine protease or subtilase that initiates the processing of ATF6. Arabidopsis encodes a large family of subtilases (Rautengarten et al., 2005), and one of them, AtS1P, At5g19660, is surprisingly similar to human S1P (P = 4.4e-231; Figure S1). Like most other Arabidopsis subtilases, AtS1P has a preprodomain structure, in that it has an N-terminal signal peptide targeting it to the secretory pathway, and a subterminal prodomain that is processed upon activation of the proenzyme. However, AtS1P differs from other Arabidopsis subtilases by the presence of a long C-terminal tail with a transmembrane domain (TMD) near its C-terminus (Figure 1a).. . Figure 1. .

(f-i) Dose responses of wild-type () and s1p-3 seedlings () to salt and mannitol. Data are expressed as the percentage inhibition in root growth after 7 days [(root length on indicated salt concentration at t = 7 days/root length on 0 salt at t = 7 days)  100]. Ten seedlings were scored in each of three repetitions and mean root lengths are plotted with  SE represented by error bars.. . . . To investigate the function of AtS1P, T-DNA insertion mutations in AtS1P (s1p-1 through s1p-5) were analyzed (Figure 1b). The mutant s1p-3, with a T-DNA insertion in the 7th exon, was considered a knockout mutation as no AtS1P transcripts were detected in the line (Figure 1c). None of the T-DNA mutants in AtS1P had observable seedling or mature plant phenotypes under normal conditions. However, it was found that s1p-3 was more sensitive to salt stress. In the absence of salt stress, s1p-3 and wild-type roots grew at about the same rate (Figure 1d), but s1p-3 root growth was reduced in comparison with wild type on 50 and 100 mM NaCl (Figure 1e,f). The mutant s1p-3 was also sensitive to other monovalent salts, such as KCl and LiCl, and to mannitol (Figure 1g-i). Thus, s1p-3 is sensitive to salt-induced osmotic stress. (For convenience we use the term salt stress throughout the paper.). To determine whether the T-DNA in s1p-3 was responsible for the salt sensitivity, the mutant was crossed with wild type, and salt sensitivity in the F2 generation co-segregated with the T-DNA (chi2 = 1.68, P = 0.20; Fig. S2a). A cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter:AtS1P cDNA construct rescued s1p-3 salt sensitivity in line S1P-9, confirming that AtS1P is responsible for the salt-sensitive phenotype (Fig. S2b). From these findings, we concluded that AtS1P functions in salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.. We examined other properties of AtS1P to better understand its role in salt tolerance, and to determine if this subtilase functions in ER stress responses in a manner comparable with mammalian S1P. An essential feature about the function of mammalian S1P in ER stress is its localization in the Golgi. To determine if AtS1P is similarly located, we fused the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to the C-terminus of AtS1P and expressed it in transgenic Arabidopsis using the 35S promoter. We found that the YFP signal was largely located in punctate structures of leaf epidermal cells co-localizing with a fluorescent marker, BODIPY TR ceramide, which has been used by others as a Golgi marker (Figure 2a-c; Vadaie et al., 2002; Egelund et al., 2006). From this, we concluded that AtS1P is also likely to be a Golgi-resident protein in Arabidopsis. To determine where AtS1P is expressed in Arabidopsis plants, AtS1P promoter:GUS constructs were developed and found to be expressed in the vasculature of roots, cotyledons and leaves of seedlings (Figure 2d, e).. .

Scale bars = 1 mm in (d and f) and 0.1 mm in (e and g).. . . . . . A membrane-associated bZIP transcription factor, AtbZIP17, mediates salt stress responses and is processed by AtS1P. The bZIP transcription factor, ATF6, is a target of S1P processing in ER stress responses in mammalian cells, and the transcription factor has a characteristic structure of a type-II membrane protein with an N-terminal bZIP domain, a transmembrane domain and a canonical (RXXL or RXLX) S1P cleavage site on the luminal side of the membrane (Figure 3a). We looked for bZIP factors with similar structures in the Arabidopsis genome and identified three, AtbZIP17 (At2g40950), AtbZIP28 (At3g10800) and AtbZIP49 (At3g56660), which we compared with AtbZIP60 (At1g42990) (Figure 3b). To determine whether any of these bZIP factors might be involved in salt tolerance, available T-DNA insertions in AtbZIP17 and AtbZIP28 were screened for salt sensitivity, and it was found that zip17 (SALK_104326, T-DNA insertion in the first exon of AtbZIP17; Figure 4a) was modestly salt sensitive (Figure 4b,c). The mutant was considered to be a knockout mutation because AtbZIP17 transcripts were not detected by RT-PCR (Figure 4d). The salt sensitivity trait co-segregated with the T-DNA (chi2 = 0.79, P = 0.37) in backcrosses to wild type (Figure S2c), and a 35S promoter:AtbZIP17 cDNA construct, used in developing line ZIP-4, rescued the salt-sensitive phenotype (Figure 4b,c; Figure S2d). These findings confirmed that the T-DNA insertion was responsible for the salt-sensitive phenotype.. . Figure 4. . Properties of the zip17 T-DNA insertion mutation in AtbZIP17.

To determine whether AtbZIP17 is processed in response to salt stress, an N-terminal myc-tagged AtbZIP17 construct was developed and introduced into transgenic seedlings. It was found that the 84-kDa construct was processed in vivo to a 46-kDa protein in salt-treated seedlings in a wild-type background (Figure 5a), consistent with cleavage in or near the TMD of AtbZIP17 (Figure 3a). The processing of AtbZIP17 did not occur in similarly treated s1p-3 seedlings (Figure 5a). We did not observe an intermediate corresponding to processing at the S1P site in vivo. However, processing intermediates of ATF6 have not been directly observed in mammalian cells either, suggesting that the S1P-cleaved intermediate is short lived (Ye et al., 2000). We did consistently observe that more 84-kDa precursor accumulated after salt treatment than before, and that more 46-kDa product was produced than expected from the quantity of precursor (Figure 5a). One explanation is that the precursor turns over in the ER membrane under normal conditions, and that both the precursor and product are stabilized following stress. An examination of that possibility is underway.. . Figure 5. . Processing of AtbZIP17 in vivo and in vitro. (a) Processing in vivo of a 35S:myc-AtbZIP17 construct in wild-type and s1p-3 seedlings incubated in high salt medium for the times indicated. (b) Processing in vitro of a His-tagged C-terminal form of AtbZIP17 by incubation with AtS1P-myc-HDEL in an anti-c-myc agarose bead pull-down assay. Reaction products were analyzed by western blot with anti-His antibody. Lanes showing lack of processing by an empty vector control (pSKM-myc) and by inhibition with 2 mm EGTA and 1 mm PMSF (phenymethylsuphony fluoride) are indicated.. . . . Processing of ATF6 in mammalian cells is a regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) process involving cleavage of the protein by S1P, followed by S2P digestion and release from the ER of the cytosolic component of the protein (Ye et al., 2000). RIP processing of ATF6 is thought to be dependent on prior S1P cleavage to remove the bulky lumenal domain, making the protein accessible to S2P digestion (Shen and Prywes, 2004). Although we did not directly observe S1P cleavage of AtbZIP17 in vivo, we wanted to determine whether AtbZIP17 is indeed a substrate for proteolysis by AtS1P. To do so, we tested whether AtbZIP17 could be cleaved by affinity-purified AtS1P in an in vitro pull-down assay. A myc-tagged form of AtS1P (AtS1P-myc-HDEL) produced in transgenic Arabidopsis was pulled down out of plant extracts with anti-myc agarose beads. (The AtS1P-myc-HDEL construct lacks a transmembrane domain to aid in solubilizing the protein and has an HDEL element to retain the protein in the ER.) The beads were washed extensively and incubated with a C-terminal His-tagged, lumen-facing fragment of AtbZIP17 (40 kDa; Figure 5b). The products of the in vitro reaction were analyzed on western blots, and a 10-kDa protein product consistent with cleavage at the canonical S1P site in AtbZIP17 was found. The product was not formed in controls when plant extracts from transgenic plants bearing an empty vector were used, or when the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) or the calcium chelator EGTA was added to the reaction. From this we posit that AtS1P directly targets AtbZIP17 for proteolysis, which makes the protein further accessible for cleavage by S2P-like processing activities. If AtS1P does indeed process AtbZIP17 in response to salt stress, then one would expect the two gene products to interact and be expressed in the same tissues. The expression pattern of AtbZIP17 promoter:GUS demonstrated that AtbZIP17 is expressed mainly in the vasculature (Figure 2f,g), similar to the tissue expression pattern for AtS1P (Figure 2d,e).. We were interested in understanding the consequences of proteolytic processing of AtbZIP17 with respect to the subcellular localization of the protein. We examined its subcellular localization under salt stress and non-stressed conditions using a 35S promoter:mGFP-AtbZIP17 construct. When grown on agar in the absence of added NaCl, mGFP fluorescence was located in cytoplasmic strands co-localizing with a fluorescent ER marker, ER-tracker DapoxyTM(DPX) (Figure 6a-c), and was excluded from nuclei (Figure 6d-f). However, after incubation of seedlings overnight on 100 mm NaCl, mGFP fluorescence from the N-terminal labeled fusion protein appeared in nuclei (Figure 6g-i). Nuclear relocalization happened on a time scale consistent with the observations on in vivo processing (Figure 5a). We observed substantial nuclear relocation of fluorescence 2 h after salt stress, and nearly maximal nuclear relocation after 4 h (Figure 6j-k). We interpret this to mean that the N-terminal component of AtbZIP17 relocates from the ER to the nucleus in response to salt stress. We have not yet observed intermediate stages in the nuclear relocation process, particularly whether AtbZIP17 moves through the Golgi. We found that AtbZIP17 is predicted to be Golgi-localized based on the attributes of its TMD (Yuan and Teasdale, 2002). However, further investigation will be needed to determine whether AtbZIP17 transiently relocates to the Golgi following salt treatment.. . Figure 6. .

The cytosolic-facing component of AtbZIP17 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of salt stress genes. To determine whether AtbZIP17 has transcription factor activity, and, if so, to identify where the activity is located, various elements of the N-terminal cytosolic-facing component of AtbZIP17 were fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain, and tested for transcriptional activation in yeast (Figure 7). Those constructs bearing the N-terminal 138 amino acids of AtbZIP17 activated the LacZ reporter gene in yeast, indicating that the N-terminal domain of AtbZIP17 is a transcriptional activator. Thus, the N-terminal cytoplasmic-facing segment of AtbZIP17, which is translocated to the nucleus during salt stress, bears bZIP DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains.. . Figure 7. . Identification of the transcriptional activation domain in AtbZIP17. Transcriptional activation domain in AtbZIP17 was identified by fusing various segments of the cytoplasm-facing component of the gene in yeast with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Indicated on the map of AtbZIP17 are the transcriptional activation domain (TAD), bZIP DNA binding domain (bZIP), proline-rich domain (PRD), transmembrane domain (TMD) and canonical S1P site. Transcriptional activity was demonstrated by X-Gal staining.. . . . To identify genes activated by AtbZIP17, we looked for salt stress responsive genes with altered expression in s1p-3. To do so, 1-week-old wild-type and s1p-3 seedlings were transferred to liquid media with or without 100 mm NaCl, and were harvested 4 h later for RNA extraction. Affymetrix Arabidopsis gene chips (ATH1) were used to profile gene expression, and significant changes in the estimated means of gene expression were determined while controlling for a false discovery rate of 1.00E-02 (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003). Genes were rank ordered by increases in expression under salt stress conditions in wild type compared with s1p-3, and those that differed in expression by more than 2.5-fold are shown (Table 1). To determine whether AtbZIP17 exercises control over these genes during salt stress, their expression was assessed in zip17 (T-DNA mutant) using semiquantitative RT-PCR (Figure 8). Exposure to 100 mM NaCl elevates the expression of these genes in wild type, but much less so in zip17. These findings are consistent with a model in which AtS1P initiates the activation of AtbZIP17, which either directly or indirectly upregulates genes such as ATHB-7. It is interesting that genes such as BiP1, BiP2 and BiP3, which are considered to be ER stress markers, were not significantly induced by salt stress.. . Table 1. .
