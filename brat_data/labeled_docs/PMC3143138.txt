Results. . RDO2 encodes a TFIIS transcription elongation factor. We aimed to identify the rdo2 mutation, which causes reduced dormancy and maps at the bottom of chromosome 2 [9]. To reduce the influence of natural variation between different accessions and to ease the recognition of the mutant phenotype during the mapping process, rdo2-1 was crossed with the Near Isogenic Line (NIL) LCN2-18 [15]. This NIL has a Ler isogenic genetic background, except for a 4.5 Mb introgression of Cvi at the bottom of chromosome 2 containing the RDO2 locus. Using a mapping population of 1100 F2 plants, the location of rdo2-1 could be assigned to a region of 46 kb between the markers T6A23-1 and T6A23-2 located at respectively 16.123 and 16.169 Mb. This region contains 15 annotated genes. Based on the structure of these genes (analyzed in The Arabidopsis Information Resource [16]) and their expression pattern (analyzed with Genevestigator [17]), the candidate gene At2g38560 was selected. Sequencing revealed a four bp deletion at the end of the coding sequence of At2g38560 in the rdo2-1 mutant (Figure 1A). The protein encoded by this gene contains three structural domains, named Transcription factor IIS N-terminal (TFSIIN), Transcription elongation factor S-IIM (TFSIIM) and Zinc finger (ZnF) (Figure 1B). This combination of domains is characteristic for Transcription elongation factor SII (TFIIS) [18]. Due to the 4 bp deletion, the rdo2-1 mutant gene translates into a protein lacking the ZnF domain, which most likely renders it not functional. At2g38560 has previously been identified as a dormancy gene by Grasser and colleagues [13], who named the gene TFIIS.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022241.g001. Figure 1. . Characterisation of RDO2..

The identity of At2g38560 as RDO2 was confirmed with additional independent T-DNA insertion mutant alleles (rdo2-2/tfIIs-2 [13] and rdo2-3; Figure 1A) in the Columbia (Col) background. Both insertion mutants lack full-length RDO2 mRNA and showed reduced dormancy, similar to rdo2-1 (Figure 1C). In addition, complementation of rdo2-2 with the RDO2 genomic locus complemented the mutant phenotype (Figure 1D).. RDO2 is ubiquitously expressed throughout all plant tissues as shown in the Arabidopsis eFP browser [19] and [13]. These authors also showed that the Arabidopsis TFIIS protein is localized in the nucleus of transiently transformed protoplasts, which is consistent with a role for RDO2 in transcription elongation [13]. In agreement, we detected YFP signal in nuclei of rdo2-1 mutant plants that were stably transformed with a p2X35S:RDO2:YFP construct (Figure 1E). However, this construct did not complement the rdo2-1 phenotype. This indicates that the YFP tag probably interferes with RDO2 function.. . . Mutations in HUB1 and RDO2 affect the expression of an overlapping set of genes. The hub1-2 mutant (previously named rdo4) was identified in the same mutagenesis screen as rdo2-1 [9]. HUB1 is required for monoubiquitination of histone H2B [10]. This histone modification is involved in transcription initiation and elongation [12], which suggests that RDO2 and HUB1 are involved in the same process. The RDO2 and HUB1 genes are both ubiquitously expressed. Because their mutants show reduced seed dormancy, we analyzed their expression dynamics in detail during seed maturation. RT-PCR analysis indicated that both genes are strongly upregulated during this phase (Figure 2A, B). This increase in expression levels, together with the identity of HUB1 and RDO2 as transcription initiation and elongation factors and the observation that rdo2-1 and hub1-2 mutants have reduced dormancy levels, indicates that transcription maintenance towards the end of seed maturation is probably required for the induction of seed dormancy. Therefore, we analyzed the transcriptomes of nearly ripe siliques (18-19 DAP) of the hub1-2 and rdo2-1 mutants in comparison with wild-type Ler using Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Micro-Arrays. The hub1-2 and rdo2-1 mutants revealed respectively 2450 and 492 differentially expressed genes (Benjamini & Hochberg (BH) adjusted P-value<0.01) (Dataset S1). The hub1-2 mutant thus has a stronger influence on the transcriptome than rdo2-1. A relatively high number of differentially expressed genes (46 up- and 75 downregulated) overlapped between both mutants (Figure 3A). The significance of this overlap was determined by calculating the representation factor, which is the number of overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from two independent random picked groups [20]. The representation factor for upregulated genes in rdo2-1 and hub1-2 is 3.1 (p<3.243e-12) and for downregulated genes 6.4 (p<1.268e-39). HUB1 and RDO2 are both positive regulators of transcription and direct targets of these proteins are expected to be found among the downregulated genes. The downregulated genes indeed showed the highest overlap between hub1-2 and rdo2-1 (30% of the total number of downregulated genes in rdo2-1 overlaps with hub1-2, compared to 19% overlap for upregulated genes). One of the downregulated genes in both hub1-2 and rdo2-1 is the dormancy gene DOG1 (Figure S1). DOG1 protein is required for the induction of dormancy and differences in DOG1 expression can explain differences in dormancy levels [7]. Therefore, downregulation of DOG1 likely contributes to the reduced dormancy of hub1-2 and rdo2-1.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022241.g002. Figure 2. .

(A) Venn diagram showing the number of overlapping and unique up- and downregulated genes in rdo2-1 and hub1-2. (B) TAGGIT gene ontology classification of up- and downregulated genes in rdo2-1 and hub1-2.. . . . We used the seed-specific gene ontology classification, called TAGGIT [21], to analyze the differentially regulated genes (Figure 3B). Stress related genes are mainly found among the down-regulated genes of both mutants. The rdo2-1 transcriptome is characterized by an upregulation of cell-wall modifying and late-embryogenesis genes. The hub1-2 transcriptome shows an upregulation of translation associated, cell-cycle related and heat shock genes.. . . Predicted PAF1C associated factors are upregulated during seed maturation and are required for the induction of seed dormancy. The human homologues of HUB1 and RDO2 are Bre1 and TFIIS respectively. Both interact with the human RNA Polymerase II Associated Factor 1 Complex (PAF1C) [14], [29], which provides a platform for the association of complexes that modulate the structure of chromatin during transcription elongation [30]. Accordingly, PAF1C has a crucial role in the regulation of histone monoubiquitination and is required for recruitment of Set1 and Set2 proteins. These proteins are involved in methylation of histone H3 at respectively K4 and K36, which are activating epigenetic marks for transcription [30]. VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE 4 (VIP4), VIP5, EARLY FLOWERING 7 (ELF7) and ELF8 are the Arabidopsis homologues of respectively the yeast proteins Leo1, Rtf1, PAF1 and CTR9, which are all components of PAF1C [31], [32], [33]. ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 7 (ATXR7) is the Arabidopsis homologue of Set1 [34]. As shown in Figure 4, the vip4, vip5, elf7-2, elf8-1 and atxr7 mutants all show significantly (p<0.0001) reduced seed dormancy levels, similar to rdo2-1 and hub1-2. Alike HUB1 and RDO2, most of these genes also show a tendency towards upregulation at the end of seed maturation between 16 and 20 DAP (Figure 5), which is however only significant for VIP5 (p=0.0255) (Figure 5B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022241.g004.

Error bars represent SE, n=4.. . . . VIP4, VIP5, ELF7, ELF8 and ATXR7 are all required for expression of the flowering repressor FLC [28] and their corresponding mutants are early flowering [32], [33], [35]. In addition, FLC expression is decreased in the hub1-4 mutant and hub1 and tfIIs mutants are early flowering [13], [22], [23]. FLC may therefore represent a connection between the regulation of flowering time and seed dormancy as it is expressed in seeds and has been shown to promote germination at low temperatures [36]. However, we could not detect an altered seed dormancy phenotype in the flc mutant (Figure 6A). Moreover, our microarray data indicate that FLC expression in mature siliques is 3-times lower in rdo2-1, but 2-times higher in hub1-2 compared to the wild-type (Figure 6B). Therefore, it is not likely that the reduced dormancy phenotype of the studied mutants is caused by altered FLC expression.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022241.g006. Figure 6. .
