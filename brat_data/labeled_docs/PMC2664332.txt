Results. . MPSS Signatures of Antisense Transcripts Are Associated with MiRNA Targets. The digital and normalized nature of Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data enables one to mathematically analyze the expression relationship of all transcriptional signatures (e.g. sense and antisense) both within and between samples. We analyzed the abundances of sense and antisense signatures for miRNA targets from the MPSS Plus Database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at) [25],[26]. A scalar value was calculated representing the abundance of antisense signatures divided by that of total signatures for a given gene. Thirteen out of the total seventeen MPSS libraries showed a higher percentage of normalized antisense signatures associated with the experimentally validated miRNA targets (n=94, Tables 1, S1 and S2) than for paralogous non-targets (n=140). The paralog genes included fourteen experimentally verified non-miRNA-targets [19],[27] and were chosen as biological controls based on the presence of a remnant pseudo-miRNA binding site that presumably does not associate with a miRNA because of sequence divergence (see Materials and Methods). For the six inflorescence libraries (the INF, INS, AP1, SAP, AP3 and AGM samples in Table 1), five had a greater abundance of normalized antisense signatures for validated targets than did paralogs, and the higher expression in the INS library was significant (P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model). Other tissues, including callus, leaf, root, silique and seedling (the CAS, LES, ROS, SIS, GSE libraries in Table 1) showed the correlation of higher antisense expression for validated targets as well, arguing against a tissue-specific bias for these antisense transcripts despite high levels of miRNAs in flowers [20]. It is noteworthy that all twelve signature method MPSS libraries (labeled by  in Table 1) gave higher normalized antisense signatures for validated miRNA targets, whereas four out of five of the classic method libraries did not (labeled by * in Table 1), raising questions about possible technical bias in the classic MPSS datasets as noted (http://mpss.udel.edu/at/). Discounting the classic method signature data, a combined statistical analysis of the signature method libraries showed that validated miRNA targets have significantly higher normalized antisense transcript expression than their paralog genes (P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model, Tables 1 and S2). The TAS1-TAS4 genes are targets of miR173, miR390 or miR828 and they require antisense transcription to generate ta-siRNAs [19],[28]. When these target genes were removed from the analysis, the average normalized antisense signature abundance for the validated miRNA targets in all 17 libraries increased (data not shown), demonstrating that antisense transcription of non-TAS miRNA target genes is substantial. Our observations suggest that mechanisms similar to those operating in the production of ta-siRNAs may also act on many bona fide miRNA targets previously concluded to be intransitive [20].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.t001.

Sum of abundance for mRNA antisense signatures (classes 3 and 6, transcript per million) was collected from the MPSS Plus Database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at/, Table S2).

Whole Genome Tiling Microarray Transcriptome Data Reveal a Correlation between Antisense Transcription and MiRNA Target Sites. The high percentage of MPSS normalized antisense signatures for the validated miRNA targets prompted us to perform a systematic survey of antisense transcription for miRNA targets and MIRNA genes. We collectively plotted the sense and antisense transcript abundance as a function of miRNA cleavage sites for validated targets (n=78), predicted targets (n=188), non-target paralogs (n=120), and the miRNA* sites of MIRNA genes (as potential cleavage sites by miRNAs [29], n=159) (See Text S1 and Table S3). This analysis excluded PPR genes, ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1), DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) (which harbors MIR838 within intron 14), and the ARF2/3/4 targets of ta-siRNAs derived from miR390 cleavage of TAS3 (AT3G17185), because these are reported evidence for miRNA target-associated transitivity [16],[20],[23],[28]. Figure 1 presents the sense and antisense strand expression as a function of the miRNA target sites. We identified a pair of expression peaks associated with validated miRNA targets flanking the miRNA cleavage site on the sense and antisense strands, which was not seen in paralogs relative to their cryptic pseudo miRNA-binding sites (Figure 1A and D). For the validated targets, an expression peak was observed immediately downstream of the miRNA cleavage site on the sense strand (Figure 1A open arrow, referred to as downstream sense signal hereafter). This could be a manifestation of higher stability of the 3 RISC cleavage fragment for miRNA target mRNAs. This interpretation is consistent with previous reports describing the accumulation of 3 endonucleolytic cleavage products of miRNA targets by Northern blot [6], reverse genetic analysis [30], and deep sequencing of non-capped polyA+ degradome libraries [31],[32],[33]. Associated with this downstream sense signal was an additional peak of transcription signal located in a 200 n.t. region upstream of the miRNA target sites on the antisense strand (Figure 1A black arrow, referred to as upstream antisense signal hereafter). Figure S1 provides additional examples of this phenomenon for high downstream-sense coupled to corresponding upstream-antisense transcript signals around the miRNA binding site for twelve different miRNAs, in which target genes also produce smRNAs. For the predicted miRNA targets, an expression pattern similar to that of validated targets was observed spanning the predicted cleavage sites (Figure 1B, open arrow for downstream sense signal and black arrow for upstream antisense signal). Statistical analysis indicated that the downstream sense and upstream antisense signals were significantly higher than the average signal elsewhere on either sense or antisense strand for validated miRNA targets and predicted targets (P<0.01, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model; Table S3). The pairs of downstream sense and upstream antisense signals for the validated targets were significantly higher compared to the same region for paralogs (Table S4, 95% confidence interval calculated). In line with the recent report of miR172-mediated cleavage of the pri-miR172b transcripts [29], we observed some sense expression signals immediately downstream of the miRNA* sites of MIRNA genes along with some antisense expression signals immediately upstream of the miRNA* sites (Figure 1C). This implies that MIRNA genes may share the same process of antisense transcription with the validated miRNA targets, possibly by miRNA interaction with miRNA primary transcripts. These observations suggested a causal relationship between miRNA target site regulation and antisense transcripts of miRNA targets and MIRNA genes that warranted further study.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g001. Figure 1. . Average topology of sense and antisense transcript signals spanning miRNA target sites.. (A) Validated miRNA targets (n=78); (B) Predicted miRNA targets (n=188); (C) miRNA genes (n=159); (D) paralogous non-targets (n=120). Data was collected from two published whole genome tiling microarray experiments with five samples from Arabidopsis flowers, leaves, roots, and two suspension cultures [11],[13]. For validated and predicted targets, each data point on the plot is the average of the normalized total signal from five tissue samples spanning 800 n.t. upstream and downstream of the validated or predicted miRNA cleavage sites. For MIRNA genes or paralogous non-targets, data for the same length of region spanning miRNA* sites or pseudo-binding sites was plotted. Signals on the sense strand are indicated by gray line and open arrow, while antisense signals are displayed by black line and black arrow. In panel A, antisense signals within the 200 n.t. range upstream (black arrow) and sense signals within the 200 n.t. range downstream (open arrow) of the miRNA cleavage site (coordinate 0 on x-axis) for validated targets have significantly higher signal intensity than elsewhere on the plot and than those in the same region of paralogs (95% confidence interval, see Tables S3 and S4). In panel B, antisense signals within the 200 n.t. range upstream of the predicted miRNA cleavage site (black arrow) is also statistically higher than those in the same region of paralogs.. . . . . . MiRNA Target-Associated Antisense Transcripts Are Affected in SmRNA Pathway Mutants. With the confirmation by two pilot custom tiling microarray experiments that the upstream antisense expression for the validated miRNA targets was technically and biologically reproducible (see Text S1), we designed two custom 3 n.t. high resolution tiling microarrays (25mer and 36mer probe lengths; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to test the role of HEN1, DCL1, HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), RDR6 and SGS3 in production of antisense transcripts associated with validated miRNA targets. The 22 target genes on the arrays were chosen based on the presence or absence of associated smRNAs that mapped to the loci, on various amplitudes of the antisense transcription signals in published whole genome tiling microarray experiments [11],[13] (Table S3), and in order to provide a representative cross section of miRNA families. The sensitivity and precision of the custom high resolution tiling microarray to detect bona fide transcripts was evidenced by three sense strand analyses: (1) by excellent concordance of the sense strand signals of Col-0 inflorescence samples relative to the two independent whole genome tiling array transcriptome datasets (Figure S2), (2) by an absence of signals from probes corresponding to annotated introns (see Figure S2A, E, F), and (3) by the observation of reasonably good concordance for the changes in miRNA target gene sense strand expression in hen1-1 mutant versus Ler-0 wild type between the custom tiling microarray and published data [19] using ATH1 microarrays (Figure S3).. Having validated the custom tiling microarray sense strand signals, the antisense signals for the miRNA targets were characterized for smRNA pathway mutants. Sixteen out of 22 genes on the microarray showed clear antisense transcription signals usually falling within 200 n.t. range upstream and/or downstream of the miRNA cleavage sites (Table S6 and Figure S4). We employed normalized delta plots for antisense transcripts (to facilitate gene-by-gene analyses) representing the differences between the means of signal intensities for biological and technical replicates of smRNA pathway mutants versus corresponding wild-type controls divided by the signals from wild-type. Fourteen of these sixteen genes displayed different amplitude antisense signals in at least one of the five smRNA pathway mutants hen1-1, dcl1-7, hyl1-2, rdr6-15, and sgs3-14. Most strikingly, the antisense signals of thirteen genes were increased in hen1-1 mutants (Table S7). Figure 2 shows normalized delta plots for APS1/AT3G22890, MYB12/AT2G47460, AP2/AT4G36920, and GRF8/AT4G24150 antisense transcript signals which demonstrate 20-40% increases in hen1-1 relative to Ler-0 wild type (Figures 2A, B, E, F; Figures S5, S6, S7 and S8, black arrows). For SCL6(IV)/AT4G00150 and TOE2/AT5G60120, there were 1 to 2.5- fold increases relative to wild type (Figures 2C and D; Figures S9 and S10). In the dcl1-7 mutant, the relative expression levels of antisense transcripts for five genes were decreased by 20-40%, including APS1, MYB12, SCL6(IV), DCL1/AT1G01040, and SPL10/AT1G27370 (Figures 3, S5, S6, S9, S11, S12). The hyl1-2 mutant had decreased antisense transcript expression by 20-50% for APS1, MYB12, SCL6(IV) and TOE2 (Figures 4, S5, S6, S9, S10). Conversely, ARF17/AT1G77850 and MET2/AT4G14140 antisense transcript expression levels were up-regulated in hyl1-2 (Table S7, Figure S13), and there was a more complex pattern of expression for TCP4/AT3G15030 antisense transcripts that were elevated in the upstream region while decreased in the downstream region in hyl1-2 (Figure S14).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g002.

Each data point is the average signal of at least 3 technical samples and is represented by the difference between the signals from hen1-1 versus Ler-0 divided by that from Ler-0 [normalized delta delta signal, (mutant signal-wild type signal)/wild type signal]. The normalized delta signal is plotted as a function of probe position relative to the miRNA cleavage site (coordinate 0 on x-axis). Black arrow pinpoints the signals in the plot which were identified by probe sets containing at least 3 contiguous probes showing at least 20% differences (up or down, not both) for the normalized delta signals. The precise same region with changed signals, if any, is indicated by black arrows for other smRNA mutants in Figures 3-. . 6.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g003. Figure 3. .

Another striking observation was seen in the sgs3-14 mutant: APS1, MYB12, TOE2, DCL1, SPL10, and TCP4 had increased expression of antisense transcripts (Figures 5A, B, D; S5, S6, S11. S12, S14). For MYB12, SCL6(IV) and TCP4, there were some antisense transcripts with complex changes corresponding to increases as well as decreases (Figures 5B, C; S6, S9, S14). In the rdr6-15 mutant, MYB12, SCL6(IV), TOE2, and TCP4 antisense transcript expression was down-regulated, while there was an increase of UBC24/AT2G33770 antisense transcripts (Figures 6B-D; S6, S9, S10, S14, S15). Taken together, around 80% of the sixteen validated miRNA targets were elevated in the hen1-1 mutants for the antisense transcript expression, whereas about a quarter to one third of these 16 targets were affected in one of the other four smRNA pathway mutants, including dcl1-7, hyl1-2, rdr6-15 or sgs3-14. MYB12 and SCL6(IV) were affected by all five mutants in that there was elevated antisense transcript expression in hen1-1, complex up and down signal levels in sgs3-14, and decreased expression in dcl1-7, hyl1-2 and rdr6-15. Because the antisense transcript topologies were replicated precisely (i.e. in the same probe sets) in completely different sets of experiments with different control genotypes Landsberg erecta and Columbia (Ler-0, Col-0), we conclude that despite their low abundance relative to sense transcripts, the antisense transcripts mapping near to the miRNA binding sites of target genes are highly reproducible.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g005.

Normalized delta signals for antisense transcripts of selected validated miRNA targets showing differences between rdr6-15 versus wild type Col-0.. Refer to Figure 2 for details of legend.. . . . Some general features characterize the identified antisense transcripts: (1) the expression peaks appeared to be concordant with sense transcripts. For example, comparison between the wild type sense and antisense strand raw signals for AP2 and SPL10 showed that these genes with introns in the probe set had no antisense transcripts in the sense intronic region (Figures S2A, S4E, S2F, and Table S6). This suggested the antisense transcripts associated with miRNA targets were generated from the mature mRNA transcripts. Supporting evidence comes from APS1, AP2 and SPL10 which also had concordant changes in antisense signals to sense signals in smRNA pathway mutants (Figures S5, S7, S12). (2) The effect on antisense transcript abundance by smRNA pathway mutants did not strictly correlate with that of sense transcripts expression except for a few cases in hen1-1 and sgs3-14. For instance, elevated expression of DCL1 antisense transcripts in hen1-1 and sgs3-14 mutants was not correlated to that of sense transcripts which were unchanged in these two mutants (Figure S11). A similar situation was seen for MET2, where the antisense transcripts of MET2 were increased in the hyl1-2 mutant. Nevertheless, its sense transcript abundances were unchanged in the corresponding mutant (Figure S13). In some other cases, the antisense transcripts had reciprocal expression patterns compared to their cognate sense transcripts, for example, MYB12 in hyl1-2 and sgs3-14, SCL6(IV) in dcl1-7, sgs3-14 and rdr6-15, and TOE2 in hyl1-2 and rdr6-15 (Figures S6, S9, S10). This suggested a possible regulatory function of antisense transcripts on their coordinate sense transcripts. For hen1-1 mutants, most antisense transcripts of validated miRNA targets were elevated along with their sense transcripts. We interpret the increased antisense transcripts as an indirect consequence of the increased stability of their sense transcripts due to the loss of function of HEN1 in the mutant, because for some targets, such as DCL1 and MET2, the antisense transcripts were up-regulated whereas the levels of their sense transcripts did not change (Figures S11, S13). For CC-NBS-LRR/AT5G43740, the observed increases in antisense transcript abundance were accompanied by a concordant decrease of its cognate sense transcript expression in hen1-1 (Figure S16). In general, these observations support the notion that the increased antisense transcripts associated with miRNA targets are due to the loss of HEN1 function, presumably due to the loss of the 2-methylated hydroxyl group on the 3 end of smRNAs in the hen1-1 mutant [22]. (3) In sgs3-14, adjacent probes for MYB12 and TCP4 reported signals of widely differing amplitudes, where a few probes showed high signals (black arrows in Figures 5B, S6 and S14) and nearby probes recorded decreased signals relative to wild type (open arrows in Figures 5B, S6 and S14). The variable effects of sgs3-14 on transcript topology suggested a dynamic process affecting antisense transcript stability, which may also explain the complex expression pattern for the antisense transcripts with SCL6(IV) and TCP4 in dcl1-7 or hyl1-2 (Figures 3 and S14). We propose this phenomenon seen with the high resolution microarray is evidence of transitive mechanisms in action, e.g. rapid smRNA production by the cleavage of antisense and/or sense transcripts detected as fluctuating microarray signals.. . . Validation and Extension of Microarray Data by Semi-Quantitative Strand-Specific Reverse Transcription PCR. qRT-PCR was employed for select miRNA targets on the microarray as well as for other miRNA target genes. qRT-PCR primers were designed from 200 n.t. range 5 upstream and 3 downstream of the miRNA cleavage sites (Figure 7A) for AP2, APS1, CATION/H+ EXCHANGER 18 (ATCHX18/AT5G41610)(miR856 cleavage site), CUC2/AT5G53950, NAC1/AT1G56010 and a negative control gene VARIANT IN METHYLATION 1 (VIM1)/AT1G57820 previously shown not cleaved by miR164 [27]. The results of qRT-PCR for sense strands were generally consistent with previous [19] and our custom tiling microarray results (Figure S2). AP2 sense transcript expression was unchanged in hen1-1, hyl1-2 and sgs3-14, whereas it was decreased in dcl1-7 and rdr6-15 (Figure 7B right panel Downstream sense expression). Also in agreement with the microarray data was the finding that AP2 antisense transcripts were increased by 30% in hen1-1 mutants, and decreased in dcl1-7. We also examined the effect of a RNA silencing suppressor protein P1/HC-Pro from Turnip mosaic virus which binds to the miRNA/miRNA* duplex and probably inhibits the 3-terminal methylation of smRNAs [34]. We found that AP2 antisense transcripts were up-regulated in a P1/HC-Pro over-expressing line. A slightly higher expression was observed by qRT-PCR for antisense transcripts in the rdr6-15 mutant than by microarray analysis (compare Figure 6E with Figure 7B). APS1 sense transcripts were increased in all mutants, supporting the microarray results for hen1-1 and sgs3-14, but in contrast to those for dcl1-7, hyl1-2, and rdr6-15 (Figure S5). The differences observed might be due to sensitivity limitations (note the low signal to noise ratios for Figures 2-. . . 6 in some cases) or amplification differences inherent to the two methods. APS1 antisense transcripts were upregulated in hen1-1, down-regulated in dcl1-7 and hyl1-2, which was congruent with tiling array results. ATCHX18 is a member of putative Na+/H+ antiporter family targeted by miR856 and miR780. The expression level of the downstream sense region for the miR856 target site was increased in hen1-1, P1/HC-Pro lines, and rdr6-15, whereas corresponding upstream antisense transcripts were elevated in all mutants (Figure 7B). Interestingly, a natural antisense transcript (AT5G41612; TAIR Release 8) overlaps with ATCHX18 and might be queried in the qRT-PCR assay, despite the primers being over 1 kb distal to the annotated natural antisense transcript. CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 2 (CUC2) and NAC1 are members of NAC domain-containing transcription factors and are validated targets of miR164. qRT-PCR data showed that CUC2 sense transcripts were up-regulated in all mutants, whereas the levels of its antisense transcripts were unchanged in most mutants except for a decrease in hen1-1. NAC1 had more sense transcript expression in hen1-1 and hyl1-2 and less expression in rdr6-15. For NAC1 antisense transcripts, expression was elevated in hen1-1 and dcl1-7, but decreased in rdr6-15 (Figure 7B). VIM1 encodes a SRA (SET- and RING-associated) domain methylcytosine-binding protein, and it has been shown to have a cryptic miR164 binding site that fails to generate a cleavage product as probed by 5-RACE [27]. Thus, it was selected as a reference control for the qRT-PCR assays. VIM1 locus clearly showed some altered sense transcripts in the smRNA pathway mutants, however, as hypothesized, no antisense transcripts were detected under experimental conditions (Figure 7B).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g007. Figure 7. . qRT-PCR for sense and antisense expression of selected miRNA targets.. (A) Cartoon showing experimental design. For each selected miRNA target, two pairs of primers are designed, one pair located upstream of the miRNA cleavage site (dashed vertical line) labeled as FP1 and RP1 (forward primer1 and reverse primer1), and another pair located downstream of the miRNA cleavage site labeled as FP2 and RP2 (forward primer2 and reverse primer2). Regions queried (upstream or downstream) are defined according to their positions relative to the miRNA cleavage site. Approximate scale of average-sized PCR products (100 b.p.) is indicated.

On the right panel Downstream Sense Expression, the primer RP2 was used in the reverse transcription and primers FP2+RP2 were used in the following PCR reaction. On the left panel Upstream antisense expression, the primer FP1 was used in the reverse transcription and primers FP1+RP1 were used in the following PCR reaction.

Each panel is a representation of at least three independent replicates from each of two biological samples that gave similar results. Asterisk (*) in the panel for CHX18 denotes the region upstream or downstream of the miR856 cleavage site on CHX18 mRNA.. . . . In order to test the functional significance of MIR164 expression on transcripts of CUC2 and NAC1, their sense and antisense transcript levels were assayed in mir164a-4, mir164b-1, mir164c-2 single mutants and mir164a-4 b-1 c-1 triple knockout mutants [35]. As expected, CUC2 sense transcripts accumulated in the mir164a-4 and mir164c-2 mutants (Figure 8 right panel), but the antisense transcripts of CUC2 were unchanged in these knockout mutants except for a slight decrease in the mir164c-2 mutant (Figure 8 left panel). NAC1 sense transcript levels were elevated in all the knockout mutants and its antisense transcripts also increased in mir164a-4, mir164c-2 and mir164a-4 b-1 c-1 mutants (Figure 8). These results suggest that miR164 is probably not a primer for the observed antisense transcription, as previously speculated based on the function of HEN1 as a methyltransferase [36]. Northern blot for miR164 expression from inflorescence samples of these mutants showed that even in mir164a-4 b-1 c-1 triple mutants, miR164 expression was not completely abolished with 20% detectable expression level comparing to that of wild type [35]. The expression of a distinct miR164 species of 24-n.t. in length was generally unchanged in all these mir164 single and triple mutants [35]. These results imply that there should be more direct determinants regulating the abundance of miRNA target-associated antisense transcripts other than miRNAs themselves.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g008.

The availability of deep sequencing datasets for smRNAs [20],[28],[37],[38] affords the means to correlate antisense transcript abundances with their presumptive DCL products and gain insight into the causal relationships of antisense transcripts and smRNAs. We mined the unique smRNAs having only one locus in the A. thaliana genome that matched perfectly to the sense or antisense strand of test sets of miRNA-associated genes (Table S8). Figure 9 shows the average number smRNAs of different size classes normalized for gene length in validated or predicted miRNA targets, paralogous non-targets, and MIRNA genes. In the categories of 20-22 n.t. smRNAs, validated miRNA targets had significantly more smRNAs matching to the sense strand compared to paralogs (Figure 9A, P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model), especially in the size class of 21 n.t. Predicted miRNA targets also generated abundant smRNAs, in which 20, 22, 23, and 24 n.t. groups gave higher numbers of smRNAs from the sense strand when compared with validated miRNA target genes. The 21 n.t. predicted target-originated sense smRNAs were significantly more abundant than those from paralogs (Figure 9A). For reference, the number of sense strand smRNAs generated from 187 miRNA hairpins (miRBase, microrna.sanger.ac.uk) was also calculated. MiRNA hairpins produced predominantly 20-22 n.t. smRNAs, which is well known as due to the processing of miRNA hairpin precursors to generate mature miRNAs and miRNA* by DCL1 and/or DCL4 [28]. MiRNA hairpins also produced 23-24 n.t. and longer smRNAs, consistent with a report on functional 23 to 25 n.t.-long miRNAs generated by DCL3 [39], indicating the overlapping functions of different DCLs on the processing of miRNA hairpin precursors. The antisense strand of miRNA targets produced smRNAs to a similar extent as those from the sense strand compared to paralogs (Figure 9B). Validated miRNA targets had significantly more 20-22 n.t. smRNAs than paralogs (P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model). The 21 n.t. sense and antisense smRNAs were the main class of smRNAs generated from validated and predicted miRNA targets, suggesting they are mechanistically linked to the RNA silencing pathway through DCL1. Remarkably, MIRNA hairpins generated antisense smRNAs as well, in which 21 n.t. antisense smRNA were also the major class (Figure 9B). Table 2 summarizes the known cases of miRNA targets and their MIRNA genes that generated antisense smRNAs, ranked according to abundances of antisense smRNAs and grouped into MIRNA gene families. It is interesting that several of the transitive MIRNA genes correlate with top-ranking miRNA targets, for example ATCHX18 and MIR780, AGO1 and MIR168a, SCL family and MIR171c, SAMT and MIR163, AP2 and TOE2 with MIR172, and the SPL family with MIR156 (Table 2). Careful analysis of the location for these sense and antisense smRNAs on the miRNA hairpins showed that about 30% of unique sense smRNAs overlap with mature miRNA sites, whereas another 28% overlap with the miRNA* sites by at least 16 n.t. (Figure S17). For the unique antisense smRNAs on the miRNA hairpins, about 14% overlap with the locus of the mature miRNA on the sense strand, whereas 27% of them overlap with the miRNA* sites Interestingly, several antisense 24 n.t. smRNAs were found to be in phase with the middle of the mature miR783 or miR854b* site on their individual hairpins (Figure S18). We propose this is evidence for the miRNA hairpin processing via the RNA silencing pathway in which the miRNA* or miRNA may be programmed into a RISC that triggers cleavage [29] and/or antisense transcription and subsequent dicing on their primary transcripts, in these cases presumably by DCL3.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g009. Figure 9. . Normalized abundance of unique smRNAs from multiple deep sequencing datasets with perfect matches to miRNA-associated gene sets.. (A) Number of unique smRNAs mapping to the sense strand of validated or predicted miRNA target genes, paralogous non-targets and MIRNA hairpins. (B) Number of unique smRNAs mapping to the antisense strand of validated and predicted miRNA targets, paralogous non-targets and MIRNA hairpins. smRNA sequences were obtained from published data [20],[28],[37],[38] and miRNA hairpin sequences were queried from the miRBase database (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/) [76]. The number of unique smRNAs were found by BLAST against the cDNA sequences or miRNA hairpins and then normalized by the length of each individual matching gene (see Material and Methods for details). The average number for each set of genes is presented here. Standard error bars are indicated in the plot. P values of Student's t-test (one-sided, equal variance assumed) are shown above the brackets between different groups.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.t002. Table 2. .

The number of antisense smRNAs with perfect matches to the cDNA for each validated miRNA target and each miRNA hairpin was scored and then divided by the length of each gene or hairpin individually (antisense smRNA number/kb). TAS genes targeted by miR173, miR390, and miR828 were excluded from this analysis.. . . . We further investigated the topology of antisense transcription manifested in smRNAs by plotting the abundance of unique smRNAs (extracted from the MPSS Plus database) as a function of the distance between the smRNA loci and the miRNA target sites for validated miRNA targets, predicted targets and paralogous non-targets (Figure 10). Validated targets had sense and antisense smRNAs clustered around 1000 n.t. upstream and downstream of the miRNA cleavage sites, with a few cases of hits >2000 n.t. upstream and 3000 n.t. downstream of the cleavage sites (Figure 10A). The numbers of sense: antisense smRNA signatures associated with validated targets were about the same (70: 62; Table S9). However, the topology of these smRNA signatures showed that the numbers of sense and antisense smRNA signatures downstream of miRNA cleavage sites were greater than those upstream (22 up: 48 down and 7 up: 55 down for sense and antisense smRNA signatures, respectively; Table S9 and Figure 10A inset). Antisense smRNAs were significantly more abundant than the sense smRNA signatures even when the two most abundant antisense smRNA signatures were removed (transcripts per quarter million=416 and 192 corresponding to NF-YA8/AT1G17590 [miR169 target]; ATHB15/AT1G52150 [miR166 target], respectively; P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model). This same phenomenon was observed in predicted miRNA targets as well, with significantly higher abundances for antisense smRNA signatures than sense smRNA ones (P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model; Table S9, Figure 10B). There were also more antisense smRNA signatures located downstream of the predicted miRNA cleavage sites than upstream antisense ones (50 up: 113 down, respectively). Paralog genes showed no significant correlation (Table S9, Figure 10C). These results indicate that generally more smRNA signatures were generated towards the 3 end of miRNA target transcripts, presumably from the downstream region of the miRNA cleavage sites on the antisense strand. These data fit with the observation that uncapped transcripts are more susceptible to RNA silencing pathways, which lead to the production of sense and antisense smRNAs [33].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g010. Figure 10. . Abundance and positions of unique MPSS smRNA signatures with perfect matches to miRNA targets and paralogous non-targets.. (A) Validated miRNA targets; (B) Predicted miRNA targets; (C) paralogous non-targets. MPSS smRNA signatures were obtained from the MPSS Plus Database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at) and searched against A. thaliana cDNA sequences to find the unique matches by BLAST (see Material and Methods for details). The abundance of unique signatures (transcripts per quarter million) is plotted as a function of the position of signatures relative to the miRNA target sites for validated and predicted miRNA targets, or to pseudo binding sites for paralogous non-targets. Sense smRNAs are plotted on the positive-valued ordinate of each panel, while antisense smRNAs are on the negative-valued ordinate. The inset in panel A shows expanded ordinate scale for the distribution of smRNAs spanning 1,000 n.t. upstream and downstream of miRNA cleavage sites for validated targets..
