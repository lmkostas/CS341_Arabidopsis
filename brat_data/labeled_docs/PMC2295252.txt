Results. . Molecular characterization of the Arabidopsis SBP-box genes SPL9 and SPL15. Mutant alleles for the Arabidopsis SBP-box genes SPL9 (At2g42200) and SPL15 (At3g57920) were obtained from screening publicly available electronic databases and seed stock centres for transposon or T-DNA tagged SPL genes. For SPL9, we identified three insertion alleles designated as spl9-1 to -3 and confirmed the nature and position of their mutations (see Materials and methods; Fig.1a). The first allele, spl9-1, was identified in the En-transposon mutagenised ZIGIA population (Baumann etal. 1998; Unte 2001) and most likely resulted from the excision of an inserted En-1 transposon leaving behind a 4-bp insertion footprint in the first exon. The result of this is a frame shift in the coding sequence and the generation of a stop-codon 86 base pairs after the insertion site. Both spl9-2 and spl9-3 represent T-DNA insertion mutant alleles identified within, respectively, the SALK collection (Alonso etal. 2003) and the GABI-Kat collection (Li etal. 2007)..

The positions of the mutations identified are indicated by open triangles, numbered according to the respective alleles. Boxes represent exons. The SBP-box sequences are depicted in black, the remaining coding sequences in grey and the untranslated 5 and 3 regions are left blank. (b) Changes in transcript levels of SPL9 and SPL15 in the shoot apical region during plant development in LD1 as determined with qRT-PCR and normalized against PP2A. For comparison, relative transcript levels were arbitrarily set to one for SPL9 5days after sowing. Error bars indicate standard deviation. (c) Absence of SPL9 and SPL15 transcripts in seedlings of the respective mutants as validated by RT-PCR. Presence of the respective transcripts in Col-0 wild type seedlings is shown for comparison and the amplification of RAN3 transcript as quality control and reference for quantification. Fragment lengths are indicated on the left in base pairs (bp). Also three independent T-DNA insertion lines for SPL15 could be obtained and confirmed (see Materials and methods; Fig.1a). Two alleles designated as spl15-1 and spl15-2 were identified within the SALK collection and one, spl15-3, within the WiscDsLox T-DNA collection.. According to data available from the AtGenExpress micro-array database (Schmid etal. 2005), both SPL9 and SPL15 transcript levels increase during development and are preferentially found in the shoot apical region and in young flowers. We confirmed this temporal expression pattern with the help of qRT-PCR (Fig.1b). In LD1 growing conditions (see Materials and methods), SPL9 and SPL15 transcript levels remain comparable during the first 2-3weeks. Thereafter, the expression level of SPL9 starts to increase followed by that of SPL15. Around 32days after sowing (DAS), at about the time Col-0 plants have undergone their reproductive phase transition, SPL9 transcript levels have become approximately two and a half times higher in comparison to SPL15 and six times in comparison to day 5. Arabidopsis lines carrying as a transgene a genomic fragment encompassing the locus for SPL15 and with a GUS reporter gene inserted downstream of the ATG start codon, confirmed the predominantly apical expression of SPL15 (Supplementary Fig.1).. RT-PCR performed on mRNA isolated from whole seedling plants homozygous for any of the three SPL9 or SPL15 mutant alleles (see Materials and methods) did not result in the detection of RNA derived of the respective genes (Fig.1c). This strongly suggests that all mutant alleles isolated represent functional null-alleles. Accordingly, plants homozygous for any of the three spl9 mutant alleles showed highly identical phenotypes, as did all three homozygous spl15 mutants (see phenotypic analysis below; Supplementary Fig.2). Allelic tests confirmed that the observed phenotypes are indeed due to mutation in either SPL9 or SPL15, respectively (data not shown).. With over 75% of their amino acid residues identical, SPL9 and SPL15 show high similarity on the level of their proteins. Also a phylogenetic comparison based on the SBP-box of all 17 SPL genes in Arabidopsis revealed SPL9 and SPL15 as most closely related and most likely forming a pair of paralogous genes (Fig.2). Based on this close relationship some degree of functional redundancy could be expected and, therefore, we created double mutant lines to uncover such redundancy. To ascertain that phenotypic changes in the mutant plants are solely due to the loss-of-function of SPL9 and SPL15 we generated two different homozygous double mutant lines with the allelic combinations spl9-1 spl15-1 and spl9-2 spl15-2, respectively. Both lines exhibit the same phenotype as described in the next section. For further detailed analysis the spl9-1 spl15-1 line was chosen and in the following referred to as spl9 spl15 for simplicity..

Phenotypic analysis of spl9 and spl15 mutants. For a phenotypic analysis, we compared spl9 and spl15 single mutants, spl9spl15 double mutants to Col-0 wild type as well as to an 35S::MIR156b transgenic line (kindly provided by D. Weigel and R. Schwab).. An interesting aspect of the MIR156b over-expressing plants, as already noticed by Schwab and co-workers (2005) is an increased rate of rosette leaf initiation which, in combination with a modest delayed flowering, results in the obvious denser rosettes of fully developed plants (Fig.3a). In addition, advanced 35S::MIR156b plants became very bushy (Fig.3c). We found these phenotypic aspects also displayed by the spl9 spl15 double mutant, albeit less pronounced (Fig.3a, b). To quantify the contribution of SPL9 and SPL15 to these phenomena, we compared the number of rosette and cauline leaves of the respective single and double mutants and of the MIR156b overexpressor to wild type (Table1). Whereas in LD2 growing conditions, the 35S::MIR156b line produced ca. eleven more rosette leaves in comparison to wild type, the single mutant lines produced, on average, only 1-2 rosette leaves more. Again, with ca. six extra rosette leaves, the spl9spl15 double mutant differed more from wild type than the single mutants and showed a stronger tendency towards the phenotype of the MIR156b overexpressor. The number of cauline leaves remained very comparable among all mutants and wild type, although some reduction may be observed particularly in the spl9 mutants..

Also with respect to the development of side shoots, the spl9spl15 double mutant differed more from wild type than the single mutants. In fact, spl9-1 and spl15-1 single mutants were found not to differ significantly from Col-0 plants that had formed, on average, 0.90.6 side shoots of at least 0.5cm in length by the time that the first siliques ripened. With an average of 2.11.1 side shoots, the spl9spl15 double mutant did significantly differ from wild type as did the 35S::MIR156b transgenic line with, on average, 4.10.8 side shoots. Taken together, the phenotypic data of the spl9spl15 double mutant clearly suggests a redundant function of SPL9 and SPL15 in shoot development and in the maintenance of apical dominance.. MiR156 is assumed to target, besides SPL9 and SPL15, exclusively other SPL genes (Rhoades etal. 2002). These too were shown to be down regulated in MIR156b over-expressing plants (Schwab etal. 2005). As in comparison to the spl9 spl15 double mutant the MIR156b over-expressor displays an even more severe aberrant phenotype, it can also be deduced that in addition to SPL9 and SPL15, other miR156-controlled SPL genes act redundantly to control shoot development and apical dominance.. In addition to the number of leaves formed before the appearance of the first flowers, we also determined for the same plants the time they needed to bolt as well as to anthesis (Table1). On average, the spl9 and spl15 single mutants behaved similar to wild type but, as expected based on the data of Schwab etal. (2005), the 35S::MIR156b line bolted and flowered somewhat later. The spl9 spl15 double mutants showed an intermediate behaviour. Whereas for the single mutants the few more leaves formed may be accounted for by the slight delay in the transition to flowering, this delay is unlikely to explain the increased rosette leaf number of the spl9 spl15 double mutant. In line with the observation of Schwab and co-workers (2005) who reported a leaf-initiation rate per day in SD of 2.2 vs. 1.4 for the MIR156b overexpressor and the wild type, respectively, this is probably best explained by assuming a shortened plastochron during vegetative growth.. To uncover a possible cause or consequence for this increased rate of leaf initiation, we microscopically examined cross sections of the vegetative shoot apex to determine size and phyllotaxy of the spl9spl5 double mutant and the MIR156b overexpressor and compared these to wild type. To this purpose, plants were grown for 41days in SD conditions, whereafter the number of rosette leaves having reached at least 0.5cm in length were recorded and their apices dissected, fixed and embedded in paraffin (see Materials and methods). At this age, Col-0 plants were found to have formed on average 24.5 leaves of 0.5cm or more, the double mutant 33.8 and the MIR156b overexpressor plants already 43.4 (Fig.4a). As the plants were of the same age, these differences most likely reflect differences in plastochron. Alternatively, one may assume large temporal differences per genotype concerning initiation of the first leaf and/or development of the last leaf recorded to have reached 0.5cm in length. However, we obtained no indications for such discrepancies and noted increasing differences in rosette density during the entire vegetative growth phase of wild type and mutants. From these data, a relative 1.8-fold (43.4/24.5) increase in leaf initiation rate of the 35S::MIR156b transgenics over wild type can be deduced, a value that quite well matches the observation of Schwab etal. (2005). Leaf initiation rate of the double mutant seem to be increased by a factor of 1.4 (33.8/24.5) in comparison to wild type.. Fig.4Leaf formation of spl9spl15 double mutant in comparison to wild type and MIR156b overexpressor. (a) Determination of the average number of rosette leaves of at least 5mm in length formed by the primary shoot and (b) of the average diameter of the primary shoot apex of spl9spl15 double mutants, Col-0 wild type and MIR156b overexpressor plants after having grown for 41days in SD. (c, d) Average circularity (c) and cross sectional area (d) of leaf primordia as determined from cross section through primary shoot as shown in e-g.

(e-g) Cross sections through primary shoot apices of a Col-0 wild type (e), a spl9spl15 double mutant (f) and a MIR156b overexpressor plant (g) after having grown for 41days in SD. Error bars in a-d indicate standard deviation (n=6). Successive leaf primordia in e-g are sequentially numbered starting with the youngest (P1). Marginal meristem on one side of leaf number 17 (L17; counted from the centre outwards) is encircled in e and g. Scale bar in e-g represents 200mum. After sectioning the paraffin embedded material, a small but not significant difference in average SAM-diameter of the spl9spl15 double mutant and Col-0 wild type could be observed (Fig.4b, e-f). However, with an average diameter of 104mum, the MIR156b overexpressor showed also a slight but yet significant (P<0.05) decrease in its SAM size compared to Col-0 (Fig.4b, e, g). Furthermore, both the spl9spl15 double mutant and the MIR156b overexpressor exhibited the same phyllotaxy as wild type with rosette leaves initiated either clock- or anticlockwise with an angle of divergence of about 137.5 between successive leaves and forming a spiral lattice with a parastichy pair (3,5) (Fig.4e-g). From these observations, it is concluded that the observed shorter plastochron is neither the result nor the cause of an altered phyllotaxy in the spl9spl15 double mutant or the MIR156b overexpressor. The shortened plastochron, however, seems to correlate with a reduced SAM size.. As obvious from cross sections shown in Fig.4e, g, the young leaves of the MIR156b overexpressor appear more roundish in shape in comparison to wild type leaves at similar positions. In particular, the vacuolated cells surrounding their midveins seem larger and the developing laminas reduced, i.e. represented by less small cytoplasm rich cells along their lateral margins. In addition, the stipules of the MIR156b overexpressor seem to be more prominent. In these aspects of leaf development, the spl9spl15 double mutant seems to behave intermediate (Fig.4e).. To quantify the difference in shape and size of the leaf primordia, we determined their circularity and cross sectional area (see Materials and methods) starting from the first leaf cross section found to be separated from the apical meristem. To reduce effects due to imperfect cross sectioning, i.e. not absolute perpendicular to the longitudinal axes, as well as in correlating sequentially numbered primordia of different sections, we averaged the values obtained over 10 successive primordia. As shown in Fig.4c, circularity of the youngest 10 leaf primordia was highly similar between the different genotypes. Circularity of subsequent older primordia decreased in all, however, more rapidly in wild type such that, on average, leaf 10-20 did differ significantly between the genotypes. Interestingly, it cannot be excluded that this difference is a direct consequence of a shortened plastochron in the mutant lines. In particular as the leaf initiation rate of the MIR156b overexpressor line lies roughly one and a half times above that of wild type. Accordingly, and with respect to absolute age, leaf 11-20 of the MIR156b overexpressor may be more comparable to leaves 6-15 of wild type and to which indeed no significant difference in circularity was found. However, in cross sectional area these young leaves differed significantly. On average, 6.52.4103mum2 for wild-type leaves 6-15 and 26.716.2103mum2 for leaf 11-20 of the MIR156b overexpressor.. It is known that the shape and other characteristics of newly formed leaves progressively change in correlation with the vegetative phase transition (Telfer etal. 1997). Furthermore, likely due to a changed plastochron, the correlation between leaf number and flowering seems to differ for the mutants and wild type. Therefore, we further investigated the possibility that the observed differences correlate with relative altered timing of the vegetative phase transition.. . . Functional analysis of SPL9 and SPL15 during the vegetative phase transition. In order to determine the timing of the vegetative phase change we used the absence or presence of abaxial trichomes on rosette leaves as a morphological marker for leaves formed during the juvenile or adult growth phase, respectively (Telfer etal. 1997). On average, in our LD2 growing conditions, the first abaxial trichomes developed on rosette leaf number six of Col-0 wild-type plants (Table1). The spl9spl15 double mutants displayed its first abaxial trichomes on leaf number twelve and the 35S::MIR156b overexpressor on leaf number 16. Although less than the spl9spl15 double mutant, the respective single mutants also developed significantly more juvenile leaves than wild type (Table1).. We distinguished juvenile and adult growth phase based on a phase dimorphism, i.e. in abaxial trichomes. However, on a plant-physiological level the juvenile phase in Arabidopsis is characterized as being incompetent to respond to photoperiodic induction of flowering (Poethig 1990). To determine if this competence was indeed affected, small populations of 20-22 plants of wild type, the spl9, spl15 single and double mutants and the MIR156b overexpressor were germinated and cultivated for 3weeks in non-inductive SD conditions (see Materials and methods). The plants were then brought into continuous light and batchwise shifted back to SD after either 1, 3 or 5days. Their flowering response was recorded within a 3-week period after this inductive treatment. Plants not flowering within this period also did not flower after 2months like plants of a control group representing all genotypes that were kept continuously in SD. As shown in Table2, the 5-day inductive treatment caused a flowering response in 100% of the plants of all genotypes. Three days also sufficed to induce all or almost all of the wild-type and single mutant plants, whereas the response of the double mutant and particular of the MIR156b overexpressor already declined. One day of continuous light, still enough to induce half or more of the wild-type and single mutant plants, did not induce flowering in any of the MIR156b overexpressor plants and only in one-tenth of the double mutants. These results thus demonstrate that also according to physiological criteria, SPL9 and SPL15 redundantly promote the juvenile-to-adult phase transition. In addition, other miR156-regulated SPL genes are expected to contribute as well based on the behaviour of the MIR156b overexpressor..

The role of gibberellin in the function of SPL9 and SPL15. The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) is known to promote flowering in many plants and in Arabidopsis it is particularly required for flowering in SD (Wilson etal. 1992). Exogenous application of GA will induce abaxial trichomes on leaves where these are normally not present although they will not appear earlier than leaf three (Telfer etal. 1997). In order to test whether the spl9spl15 double mutant and the MIR156b overexpressor are defective in gibberellin sensitivity or biosynthesis, we exogenously applied GA3 and compared the onset of abaxial trichome production to mock treated and wild-type plants grown in LD1 (Fig.5). Like in wild type, the GA3 treatment strongly reduced the number of rosette leaves without abaxial trichomes, i.e. juvenile leaves, with about a factor of three. This result shows that the spl9spl15 double mutant and the MIR156b overexpressor remained sensitive to GA3. However, in both the spl9spl15 double mutant and the MIR156b overexpressor the amount of GA3 applied could not reduce the number of juvenile leaves to that of obtained in GA3 treated wild type.. Fig.5Effect of GA on spl9spl15 double mutant and MIR156b overexpressor plants in comparison to wild type. The number of juvenile rosette leaves formed is shown for plants that were either regularly sprayed with GA3 (100muM GA3) or mock treated. Error bars indicate standard deviation (n=8).
