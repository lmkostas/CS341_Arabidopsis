Results. . WRKY18, WRKY40, and WRKY60 bind the ABI4 promoter and cooperatively inhibit its activity. It was previously observed that WRKY40 binds the promoter of the ABI4 gene (Shang et al., 2010), but it still remains unknown whether it regulates ABI4 expression, and whether WRKY18 and WRKY60 also interact with ABI4 promoter and regulate its expression. ABI4 belongs to a class of Apetala-2 domain transcription factors (Finkelstein et al., 1998), and the ABI4 gene has, in its promoter region, W-box sequences, a cis-regulatory element to which the WRKY transcription factors bind. Interactions of the WRKYs with the ABI4 promoter were first tested in a yeast one-hybrid system. Yeast cells co-transformed with both a WRKY-encoding cDNA (WRKY18, WRKY40, or WRKY60) and the ABI4 promoter could grow in a selection SD medium (lacking Trp, Leu, and His nutrients, and containing 3-AT), indicating a potential interaction between the WRKYs and the ABI4 promoter (Fig. 1A). As a negative control, yeast cells co-transformed with empty vector (pGADT7) and the ABI4 promoter could not grow in this medium (Fig. 1A), showing that this system was specific for testing protein-promoter interactions. These data suggested that WRKY18 and WRKY60 potentially bind the promoter of ABI4 (Fig. 1A).. . Fig. 1. . . Interaction of WRKYs with the ABI4 promoter. (A) Yeast one-hybrid assay. The prey vector harbouring WRKY40, WRKY18, and WRKY60 (indicated by +WRKY18, +WRKY40, and +WRKY60, respectively) and the bait vector pHIS2 harbouring the ABI4 promoter (indicated by pABI4-pHIS2) were used to co-transform yeast cells. The transformation with the empty vector pGADT7 (indicated by + pGADT7) was taken as a negative control. The experiments were repeated three times with the same results. (B) The promoter structure of the ABI4 gene. W1, W2, and W3 denote each W-box numbered from left to right with sequence sites relative to the star code. The top bars with the pABI4-1 and pABI4-2 domains indicate the sequence fragments used in the ChIP assay with the antiserum specifically against WRKY40, which was described in a previous report (Shang et al., 2010). The bottom bars with the first domain (pABI4-I) and second domain (pABI4-II) indicate the sequence fragments used in the GSAs described in (C) and (D). (C) GSA shows that WRKY18, WRKY40, WRKY60, WRKY18 plus WRKY40 (WRKY18+40), WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY18+60), WRKY40 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+60), and WRKY40 plus WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+18+60) all bind the pABI4-I fragment (left panel). The 6His tag peptide (6His), which was fused to WRKY protein for WRKY protein production, and BSA protein (left panel) and the promoter fragments harbouring the mutated W-box 1 (W1) (right panel), served as negative controls. W-box mutation at W1: TTGACTTCAC (see the Materials and methods). The experiments were repeated five times with substantially the same results. (D) GSA shows that WRKY40, WRKY60, WRKY40 plus WRKY18 (WRKY40+18), WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY18+60), and WRKY40 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+60) bind the pABI4-II fragment, but WRKY18 and WRKY40 plus WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+18+60) do not (left panel). The 6His tag peptide (6His), which was fused to WRKY protein for WRKY protein production, and BSA protein and the promoter fragments harbouring the mutated W-boxes 2 and 3 (W2/W3), served as negative controls (right panel). W-box mutations at W2 and W3: TGACTTAC (see the Materials and methods). The experiments were repeated five times with substantially the same results. In (C) and (D), loading protein amounts were tested by immunoblotting with anti-6His serum and an antiserum specifically against WRKY40 (Shang et al., 2010), and relative band intensities, which are normalized relative to the intensity of the loading sample of the assay with WRKY40 alone (indicated by 100), are indicated by numbers above (for WRKY40 bands) or below the bands (for Ant-6His bands).. . . . These protein-promoter interactions were confirmed, and interactions of the WRKYs with two different domains of the ABI4 promoter were further tested in a GSA, in which one domain (domain I, pABI4-I) covers the first W-box and another covers the second and third W-boxes (domain II, pABI4-II) (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1 available at JXB online). The three WRKY proteins were produced and purified from E. coli (Supplementary Fig. S1), and it was shown that the purified WRKY18, WRKY40, and WRKY60 proteins all bind domain I (pABI4-I) (Fig. 1C). The mixed proteins WRKY18 plus WRKY40, WRKY18 plus WRKY60, WRKY40 plus WRKY60, or all three WRKYs all showed binding activities to this promoter domain (Fig. 1C).. WRKY40 and WRKY60, but not WRKY18, showed binding activities to domain II of the ABI4 promoter (pABI4-II), and the mixed proteins pairs WRKY18 plus WRKY40, WRKY18 plus WRKY60, or WRKY40 plus WRKY60 also showed binding activities to this promoter domain, while the three mixed WRKYs showed no binding activity to this domain (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the interactions of the three WRKYs with each other affect their binding to this domain. It is noteworthy that a previous report showed the in vivo interaction of WRKY40 with the ABI4 promoter by ChIP via pABI4-I/II domains (Fig. 1B, and see also Shang et al., 2010), which is consistent with the data of the present GSA.. As negative controls, neither the binding activity of the WRKYs to the ABI4 promoter domains harbouring a mutated W-box 1 (Fig. 1C) or mutated W-boxes 2 and 3 (Fig. 1D), nor that of 6His peptide and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to any domain of the ABI4 promoter (Fig. 1C, 1D), was observed, showing that the observed binding activities of the WRKYs were specific in this GSA system. Additionally, the loading amounts of the different WRKY proteins in the assays were tested by immunoblotting, which showed that substantially an equal amount of each WRKY protein was loaded in the assays with a single WRKY protein, WRKY18, WRKY40, or WRKY60, while the amounts were equally doubled in the assays with two WRKY proteins, and tripled with three WRKY proteins, indicating that the loss of binding activities of WRKY18 and the mixture of the three WRKYs to the pABI4-II domain (Fig. 1D) was specific, but was not caused by a possible difference in protein loading amount.. Next, the interactions of WRKY18 and WRKY60 with the ABI4 promoter in the same above-mentioned pABI4-I/II domains were assayed by ChIP analysis combined with PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. It was observed that WRKY18 binds to the promoters of ABI4 via the pABI4-I domain but not the pABI4-II domain, and that WRKY60 binds the promoters of ABI4 via both the pABI4-I and pABI4-II domains (Fig. 2A, 2B; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online), which is consistent with the data of the above-described GSA (Fig. 1B-D), and reveals that WRKY18 and WRKY60 interact with the ABI4 promoter in vivo.. . Fig. 2. . . WRKY18 (A and B) and WRKY60 (C and D) interact with the promoters of ABI4 and ABI5: ChIP assay. (A and C) PCR data from the ChIP assay. In the promoter fragment names, the prefix p indicates promoter. The sequences for each promoter fragment (indicated by the suffix number) are indicated in Fig. 1B (for ABI4) and Fig. 5B (for ABI5). In, PCR product from the chromatin DNA; -, PCR product from ChIP with pre-immune serum (as a negative control); +, PCR product from ChIP with the antibody against green fluorescent protein (GFP) which was used to tag WRKY18 and WRKY60 to express the fusion proteins in the wrky18 and wrky60 knockout mutants, respectively, and ChIP assays were performed with these transgenic mutant plants. (B) and (D) Real-time PCR data from the ChIP assay with the antibody against GFP and with the Actin promoter (pACTIN) as a negative control. All the symbols for promoters present the same significances as described in (A) and (C). Each value in (B) and (D) is the mean SE of five independent determinations, and different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05 (Duncans multiple range test).. . . . Furthermore, the interactions of WRKYs with the ABI4 promoter were assayed in an in vivo system by co-transforming tobacco leaves with the WRKY genes and the ABI4 promoter linked to LUC. The results showed that all the three WRKYs interact with the ABI4 promoter in vivo, and WRKY40 and WRKY60 inhibit the promoter activity reported by LUC-produced fluorescence (Fig. 3A). It was observed that co-expression of WRKY18 and WRKY40 suppressed the repressive effect of WRKY40, and co-expression of WRKY40 and WRKY60 partly suppressed the repressive effect of the single WRKY40 or WRKY60 on the ABI4 promoter activity (Fig. 3B). The co-expression of the three WRKYs completely suppressed the repressive effect of the each single WRKY on the ABI4 promoter activity (Fig. 3C), which is consistent with the inability of the mixture of the three WRKYs to bind to domain II of the ABI4 promoter observed in the GSA (Fig. 1D). As internal controls, the Actin2 protein was co-expressed with the ABI4 promoter-LUC and/or with the WRKYs in a virtually equal amount for each assay, which did not change the activity of ABI4 promoter-LUC (Fig. 3D) or any observations (Fig. 3A-C), and the expression levels of each WRKY protein, assayed by immunoblotting with the antiserum against their Myc tag, showed no significant difference among them in any assay (Fig. 3A, 3B), indicating that the observed differences in the fluorescence intensity were not caused by possible differences in the WRKY levels. These controls showed that the observations of these WRKY-ABI4 promoter interaction assays are specific and reliable. Additionally and importantly, it was further shown that WRKY40 and WRKY60 did not inhibit the activity of the ABI4 promoter harbouring W-box 2 and 3 double mutations (Fig. 4A), revealing that the WRKY proteins bind the ABI4 promoter through the W-box motif.. . Fig. 3. . . Test of the interactions of WRKYs with the ABI4 promoter in vivo in tobacco leaves. Tobacco leaves were transformed with the following constructs together with a control construct harbouring the Actin-encoding open reading frame, called K: (A) with pABI4-LUC plus K, pABI4-LUC plus WRKY40 and K, pABI4-LUC plus WRKY18 and K, or pABI4-LUC plus WRKY60 and K; (B) with pABI4-LUC plus K, pABI4-LUC plus WRKY40 and WRKY18 and K, pABI4-LUC plus WRKY18 and WRKY60 and K, or pABI4-LUC plus WRKY40 and WRKY60 and K; (C) with pABI4-LUC plus K, or pABI4-LUC plus WRKY40 and WRKY18 and WRKY60 and K; and (D) with pABI4-LUC alone and pABI4-LUC plus K (as controls). The prefix p indicates promoter. Left panels in (A), (B), (C), and (D): fluorescence imaging. Right panels in (A), (B), (C), and (D): fluorescence intensities estimated by fluorescence counts. The expression levels of the internal control Actin protein (K) and the Myc-tagged WRKY18/WRKY40/WRKY60 protein were assayed by immunoblotting with antiserum against Actin and anti-Myc serum, respectively, and are displayed below the fluorescence count columns. Relative protein band intensities, which are normalized relative to the intensity of the sample from no-transgenic portions (NT) of the same transgenic leaves for K (Actin), or to that of the pABI4-WRKY40 treatment (A) or pABI4-WRKY40+18 treatment (B), are indicated by numbers below the bands. Each value for the columns in the right panels is the mean SE of five independent determinations, and different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05 (Duncans multiple range test).. . . . . Fig. 4. . . Test of the interactions of WRKYs with the W-box-mutated ABI4 and ABI5 promoters in vivo in tobacco leaves. The ABI4 promoter harbours W-box 2 and 3 double mutations (still named pABI4), and the ABI5 promoter harbours W-box 1, 2, and 4 triple mutations (still named pABI5). The tobacco leaves were transformed with the following constructs together with a control construct harboring the Actin-encoding open reading frame (K): (A) with pABI4-LUC plus K, pABI4-LUC plus WRKY40 and K, pABI4-LUC plus WRKY18 and K, or pABI4-LUC plus WRKY60 and K; (B) with pABI5-LUC plus K, pABI5-LUC plus WRKY40 and K, pABI5-LUC plus WRKY18 and K, or pABI5-LUC plus WRKY60 and K. Left panels in (A) and (B): fluorescence imaging. Right panels in (A) and (B): fluorescence intensities estimated by fluorescence counts. The expression levels of the internal control Actin protein (K) and the Myc-tagged WRKY18/WRKY40/WRKY60 protein were assayed by immunoblotting with antiserum against Actin and anti-Myc serum, respectively, and are displayed below the fluorescence count columns. Relative protein band intensities, which are normalized relative to the intensity of the sample from no-transgenic portions (NT) of the same transgenic leaves for K (Actin), or to that of the pABI4- (A) or pABI5-WRKY40 treatment (B), are indicated by numbers below the bands. Each value for the columns in the right panels is the mean SE of five independent determinations, and different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05 (Duncans multiple range test).. . . . . . WRKY18, WRKY40, and WRKY60 bind the ABI5 promoter and cooperatively inhibit its activity. It was previously shown that WRKY40 binds the promoter of ABI5 and represses its expression (Shang et al., 2010), but it still remains unknown whether WRKY18 and WRKY60 interact with the ABI5 promoter and regulate its expression. ABI5 is a member of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family (Finkelstein and Lynch, 2000), and there are six W-boxes in the promoter region of the ABI5 gene. The same assays as described above for the ABI4 promoter was performed to test interactions of WRKYs with the ABI5 promoter. It was shown that, as previously reported for WRKY40 (Shang et al., 2010), the two other WRKY members WRKY18 and WRKY60 interact with the ABI5 promoter in the yeast one-hybrid system (Fig. 5A). For assaying these protein-promoter interactions by the GSA system, three domains in the ABI5 promoter were isolated: domain I (pABI5-I) covers the first and second W-boxes, domain II (pABI5-II) covers the fourth and fifth W-boxes, and domain III covers the sixth W-box (Fig. 5B). W-box 3 was not assayed due to a technical difficulty with its isolation (Fig. 5B). It was shown that WRKY18 and WRKY40, but not WRKY60, bind domain I (pABI5-I) and domain II (pABI5-II) (Fig. 5C, 5D), and that WRKY18 and WRKY60, but not WRKY40, bind domain III (pABI5-III) of the ABI5 promoter (Fig. 5E).. . Fig. 5. . . Interaction of WRKYs with the ABI5 promoter. (A) Yeast one-hybrid assay. The prey vector harbouring WRKY40, WRKY18, and WRKY60 (indicated by +WRKY40, +WRKY18, and +WRKY60, respectively) and the bait vector pHIS2 harbouring the ABI5 promoter (indicated by pABI5-pHIS2) were used to co-transform yeast cells. The transformation with empty vector pGADT7 (indicated by +pGADT7) was taken as a negative control. The experiments were repeated three times with the same results. (B) The promoter structure of the ABI5 gene. W1-W6 denote each W-box numbered from left to right with sequence sites relative to the star code. The top bars with the pABI5-1 to ABI5-5 domains indicate the sequence fragments used in the ChIP assay with the antiserum specifically against WRKY40, which was described in a previous report (Shang et al., 2010). The bottom bars with the first domain (pABI5-I), second domain (pABI5-II), and third domain (pABI5-III) indicate the sequence fragments used in the GSAs described in (C), (D), and (E). (C) GSA shows that WRKY18, WRKY40, WRKY40 plus WRKY18 (WRKY40+18), WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY18+60), and WRKY40 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+60) bind the pABI5-I fragment, but WRKY60 and WRKY40 plus WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+18+60) do not (left panel). The 6His tag peptide (6His), which was fused to WRKY protein for WRKY protein production, and BSA protein and the promoter fragments harbouring the mutated W-boxes 1 and 2 (W1, W2) or the W1/W2 double mutation, served as negative controls (right panel). W-box mutation at W1: TTGACTTCAC, and at W2: GTCAACTCAA (see the Materials and methods). The experiments were repeated five times with substantially the same results. (D) GSA shows that WRKY40, WRKY18, WRKY40 plus WRKY18 (WRKY40+18), and WRKY40 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+60) bind the pABI5-II fragment, but WRKY60, WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY18+60), and WRKY40 plus WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+18+60) do not (top panel). The 6His tag peptide (6His), which was fused to WRKY protein for WRKY protein production, and the promoter fragments harbouring the mutated W-box 4 (W4), served as negative controls (bottom panel). W-box mutation at W4: GTCAGTTA (see the Materials and methods). The experiments were repeated five times with substantially the same results. (E) GSA shows that WRKY18, WRKY60, WRKY40 plus WRKY18 (WRKY40+18), WRKY40 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+60), and WRKY40 plus WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY40+18+60) bind the pABI5-III fragment, but WRKY40 and WRKY18 plus WRKY60 (WRKY18+60) do not (top panel). The 6His tag peptide (6His), which was fused to WRKY protein for WRKY protein production, and BSA protein and the promoter fragments harbouring the mutated W-box 6 (W6), served as negative controls (bottom panel). W-box mutation at W6: GTCAACTCAA (see the Materials and methods). The experiments were repeated five times with substantially the same results. In (C), (D), and (E), loading protein amounts were tested by immunoblotting with anti-6His serum and an antiserum specifically against WRKY40 (Shang et al., 2010), and relative band intensities, which are normalized relative to the intensity of the loading sample of the assay with WRKY40 alone (indicated by 100), are indicated by numbers above (for WRKY40 bands) or below the bands (for Ant-6His bands).. . . . The binding of WRKY18 to domain II disappeared when it was mixed with WRKY60 (Fig. 5D), and binding of WRKY 18 and WRKY60 to domain III disappeared when the two WRKYs were mixed together (Fig. 5E), suggesting a mutual antagonistic effect of WRKY18 and WRKY60 in these binding processes to domains II and III of the ABI5 promoter. However, WRKY18 and WRKY60 did not show antagonistic interaction in their binding to domain I (Fig. 5C). The mixed proteins WRKY18 plus WRKY40 and WRKY40 plus WRKY60 showed binding activities to all three domains I, II, and III (Fig. 5C, 5D, 5E). The mixture of the three WRKYs was shown to bind domain III (Fig. 1E), but not domains I or II (Fig. 3C, 3D). These data suggest, as described above for the ABI4 promoter, that the interactions of the WRKYs with each other affect their binding to the ABI5 promoter domains.. Neither the binding activity of the WRKYs to the negative control ABI5 promoter domains harbouring various mutated W-boxes, nor that of 6His peptide and BSA to any domain of the ABI5 promoter (Fig. 5C, 5D, 5E), was observed, showing that the observed binding activities of the WRKYs were specific. The loading amounts of the different WRKY proteins in the assays, tested by immunoblotting, were shown to be substantially equal for each WRKY protein in the assays with a single WRKY protein, and the amounts were equally doubled in the assays with two WRKY proteins, and tripled with three WRKY proteins, indicating that the loss of binding activities of the different WRKYs or mixtures (Fig. 5C-E) was specific, but was not caused by a possible difference in the protein loading amount.. The above-described binding activity of WRKY18 to all three domains (pABI5-I/II/III) of the ABI5 promoter and that of WRKY60 to the pABI5-III domain of the ABI5 promoter (Fig. 5B-E) were confirmed by the ChIP analysis (Fig. 2A, 2B; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online), revealing that WRKY18 and WRKY60 interact with the ABI5 promoter in vivo.. It is noteworthy that the in vivo interaction of WRKY40 with the ABI5 promoter by the ChIP assay via pABI5-3/4 domains (Shang et al., 2010) that cover the pABI5-II domain of the present experiment (Fig. 5B), but not via the pABI5-5 domain (Shang et al., 2010) that covers the pABI5-III domain of the present experiment (Fig. 5B), was previously shown, which is consistent with the data of the above-described GSA (Fig. 5D, 5E). However, the previous report did not detect any binding activity of WRKY40 to the pABI5-1/2 domains (Shang et al., 2010) that cover the present pABI5-I domain (Fig. 5B), which is inconsistent with the data of the above-described GSA (Fig. 5C).These experiments were conducted repeatedly, and the results were confirmed. The reason for this inconsistency is unknown. Nevertheless, the present GSA-detected in vitro interaction of WRKY40 with the ABI5 promoter is essentially consistent with the ChIP-detected in vivo data.. Furthermore, using the in vivo system by co-transforming tobacco leaves with the WRKY genes and the ABI5 promoter, it was shown that WRKY18 and WRKY40 interacted with the ABI5 promoter in vivo, and inhibited the promoter activity, while WRKY60 showed a reduced in vivo effect (Fig. 6A). This is globally consistent with the GSA data in which WRKY60 does not bind two (domain I or II) of the three domains of the promoter (Fig. 5C, 5D). It was further observed that co-expression of WRKY18 and WRKY60 suppressed the repressive effect of WRKY18 on the ABI5 promoter activity (Fig. 6B), which is consistent with the antagonistic effect of WRKY60 on WRKY18 binding to domains II and III of the ABI5 promoter observed in the GSA (Fig. 5D, 5E). As mentioned above for the ABI4 promoter (Fig. 3C), co-expression of the three WRKYs completely suppressed the repressive effect of each single WRKY18 or WRKY40 on the ABI5 promoter activity (Fig. 6C), which is consistent with the inability of the mixture of the three WRKYs to bind domain I or II of the ABI5 promoter observed in the GSA (Fig. 5C, 5D).. . Fig. 6. . . Test of the interactions of WRKYs with the ABI5 promoter in vivo in tobacco leaves. The tobacco leaves were transformed with the following constructs together with a control construct harbouring the Actin-encoding open reading frame, called K: (A) with pABI5-LUC plus K, pABI5-LUC plus WRKY40 and K, pABI5-LUC plus WRKY18 and K, or pABI5-LUC plus WRKY60 and K; (B) with pABI5-LUC plus K, pABI5-LUC plus WRKY40 and WRKY18 and K, pABI5-LUC plus WRKY18 and WRKY60 and K, or pABI5-LUC plus WRKY40 and WRKY60 and K; (C) with pABI5-LUC plus K, or pABI5-LUC plus WRKY40 and WRKY18 and WRKY60 and K; and (D) with pABI5-LUC alone and pABI5-LUC and K (as controls). The prefix p indicates promoter. Left panels in (A), (B), (C). and (D): fluorescence imaging. Right panels in (A), (B), (C), and (D): fluorescence intensities estimated by fluorescence counts. The expression levels of the internal control Actin protein (K) and the Myc-tagged WRKY18/WRKY40/WRKY60 protein were assayed by immunoblotting with the antiserum against Actin and anti-Myc serum, respectively, and are displayed below the fluorescence counts columns. Relative protein band intensities, which are normalized relative to the intensity of the sample from no-transgenic portions (NT) of the same transgenic leaves for K (Actin), or to that of the pABI5-WRKY40 treatment (A) or pABI5-WRKY40+18 treatment (B), are indicated by numbers below the bands. Each value for the columns in the right panels is the mean SE of five independent determinations, and different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05 (Duncans multiple range test).. . . . In the internal controls, it was observed that the Actin2 protein with the ABI5 promoter-LUC and/or with the WRKYs co-expressed in a substantially equal amount did not change the activity of the ABI5 promoter-LUC (Fig. 6D) or any observations (Fig. 6A-C), and the expression levels of each WRKY protein, assayed by immunoblotting with the antiserum against their Myc tag, showed no significant difference among them in any assay (Fig. 6A, 6B), indicating that the observed differences in the fluorescence intensity were not caused by possible differences in the WRKY levels. These controls showed that the observations of these WRKY-ABI5 promoter interaction assays are specific and reliable. It was further shown that WRKY18, WRKY40, and WRKY60 did not inhibit the activity of the ABI5 promoter harbouring W-box 1, 2, and 4 triple mutations (Fig. 4B), revealing that the WRKY proteins bind the ABI5 promoter through the W-box motif.. . . Disruption of WRKY18, WRKY40, or WRKY60 enhances ABI4 or ABI5 expression in germinating seeds. It was previously shown that, in 2-week-old seedlings, disruption of either WRKY18 or WRKY40 decreased ABI4 expression, but increased ABI5 expression, and disruption of both the WRKY genes increased expression of both ABI4 and ABI5, while disruption of WRKY60 increased ABI4 expression, but decreased ABI5 expression (Shang et al., 2010). Given that ABI4 and ABI5 are mainly expressed in early developmental processes and regulate seed germination and post-germination growth (Finkelstein et al., 1998; Finkelstein and Lynch, 2000), the expression levels of these two genes were tested in germinating seeds of different wrky mutants 36h and 90h after stratification. The results showed that the expression levels of both ABI4 and ABI5 increased in the wrky40 single mutant and the wrky18 wrky40 and wrky18 wrky60 double mutants in comparison with those in wild-type plants at both 36h and 90h after stratification (Fig. 7). The data in the wrky18 wrky40 double mutant and those regarding ABI5 expression in the wrky40 mutant are consistent with those obtained in 2-week-old mutant plants (Shang et al., 2010), but the up-regulation of ABI4 expression in the wrky40 mutant was not observed in the 2-week-old mutant plants, in which ABI4 was down-regulated (Shang et al., 2010) as mentioned above. In the wrky18 single mutant and wrky18 wrky40 wrky60 triple mutant, expression of ABI5 increased, but that of ABI4 was not significantly affected at both 36h and 90h after stratification (Fig. 7). In contrast, in the wrky60 single mutant and wrky40 wrky60 double mutant, expression of ABI4 increased at both 36h and 90h after stratification, but that of ABI5 was not significantly affected at 36h after stratification; however, at 90h after stratification, ABI5 was up-regulated in the two mutants (Fig. 7). The data regarding ABI4 expression in the wrky60 mutant and ABI5 expression in the wrky18 mutant are consistent with those obtained in 2-week-old mutant plants (Shang et al., 2010), but ABI4 in the wrky18 mutant and ABI5 in the wrky60 mutant were shown to be down-regulated in the 2-week-old mutant plants (Shang et al., 2010), which is different from the expression levels in the germinating seeds (Fig. 7). These findings showed that the regulation of expression of ABI4 and ABI5 by the three WRKY transcription factors is developmental stage dependent. Previous reports did not observe differences in ABI4 and ABI5 expression in the wyky18 mutant in 5-week-old mature plants (Pandey et al., 2010; Wenke et al., 2012), suggesting that WRKY18 (or also the other two WRKYs) does not function in the regulation of these two ABA-related genes during late developmental stages, which is consistent with the very early expression profile of ABI4 and ABI5 mainly in germinating seeds and young seedlings (1-5 d after stratification; Finkelstein et al., 1998; Finkelstein and Lynch, 2000; Lopez-Molina et al., 2001) and with the present observations that the three WRKYs function to regulate early developmental processes including seed germination and early seedling growth in response to ABA.. . Fig. 7. . . Expression of ABI4 and ABI5 in the wrky mutants. The germinating seeds were sampled at 36h and 90h after stratification to assay expression of ABI4 (top panels) and ABI5 (bottom panels) in the wrky single, double (wrky40 wrky18, wrky18 wrky60, and wrky40 wrky 60), and triple (wrky40 wrky18 wrky60) mutants by quantitative real-time PCR. Each value is the mean SE with five independent determinations, and different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05 (Duncans multiple range test).. . . . . . Introduction of the abi4 or abi5 mutation into the wrky18 and wrky60 mutants suppresses ABA hypersensitivity of these mutants. It was previously reported that WRKY40 functions directly upstream of ABI5 and also probably upstream of ABI4 in ABA signalling (Shang et al., 2010), but it remains unclear whether WRKY18 and WRKY60 cooperate with WRKY40 to regulate ABA signalling upstream of ABI4 and ABI5. In the present experiment, it was first confirmed that the null mutation in the WRKY18 or WRKY60 gene results in ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes in seed germination and post-germination growth, though the ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes are weaker in the wrky60 mutant than in the wrky18 mutant (Figs 8-10). The wrky60 mutant showed wild-type ABA responses sometimes, especially at higher ABA concentrations for seed germination (Fig. 8C, 8D) or at lower ABA concentrations for post-germination growth (Fig. 9C, 9D), but in no case did this mutant show ABA-insensitive phenotypes. The ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes of the wrky18 mutant were virtually always significant (Figs 8A, 8B, 9A, B, 10). It is noteworthy that post-germination growth was assayed with two different systems: one in which the seeds were directly planted in ABA-containing medium, and post-germination growth was investigated 7 d after stratification (Fig. 9), and another system in which the germinating seeds were transferred ~46h after stratification from ABA-free medium to ABA-containing medium, and post-germination growth was recorded 10 d after the transfer (Fig. 10). Substantially the same results of ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes in post-germination growth were obtained with these two systems for both wrky18 and wrky60 mutants (Figs 9, 10). These data verify previous observations that both WRKY18 and WRKY60 negatively regulate ABA signalling (Shang et al., 2010), and support the notion that WRKY60 balances the negative roles of WRKY18 and WRKY40 in ABA signalling.. . Fig. 8. . . The abi4 and abi5 mutations suppress ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes of the wrky18 and wrky60 mutants in ABA-induced seed germination inhibition. Seed germination rate of the wild-type plants (Col) and mutants abi4, wrky18, and abi4 wrky18 (A), abi5, wrky18, and abi5 wrky18 (B), abi4, wrky60, and abi4 wrky60 (C), or abi5, wrky60, and abi5 wrky60 (D) was recorded in ABA-free medium (0 M ABA) and ABA-containing medium (0.5, 1, and 3 M) from 48h to 72h after stratification. Each value is the mean SE of five independent biological determinations and different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05 (Duncans multiple range test) when comparing values within the same ABA concentration and the same time point after stratification.. . . . . Fig. 9. . . The abi4 and abi5 mutations suppress ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes of the wrky18 and wrky60 mutants in ABA-induced post-germination arrest assessed by planting seeds directly in ABA-containing medium. Post-germination growth of the wild-type plants (Col) and mutants abi4, wrky18 (w18), and abi4 wrky18 (18 i4) (A), abi5, wrky18 (w18), and abi5 wrky18 (18 i5) (B), abi4, wrky60 (w60), and abi4 wrky60 (60 i4) (C), or abi5, wrky60 (w60), and abi5 wrky60 (60 i5) (D) was recorded in ABA-free medium (0 M ABA, as indicated at the bottom) and ABA-containing medium (0.3 M and 0.6 M, as indicated at the bottom) 7 d after stratification. The right panels (columns) show corresponding statistical data of the root length of these mutants, in which each value is the mean SE of five independent biological determinations and different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05 (Duncans multiple range test) when comparing values within the same ABA concentration.. . . . . Fig. 10. . . The abi4 and abi5 mutations suppress ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes of the wrky18 and wrky60 mutants in ABA-induced post-germination arrest assessed by transferring germinating seeds 48h after stratification from ABA-free medium to ABA-containing medium. Post-germination growth of the wild-type plants (Col) and mutants abi4, wrky18 (w18), and abi4 wrky18 (18 i4) (A), abi5, wrky18 (w18), and abi5 wrky18 (18 i5) (B), abi4, wrky60 (w60), and abi4 wrky60 (60 i4) (C), or abi5, wrky60 (w60), and abi5 wrky60 (60 i5) (D) was recorded in ABA-free medium (0 M ABA, as indicated at the bottom) and ABA-containing medium (1 M, as indicated at the bottom) 10 d after stratification. The right panels (columns) show corresponding statistical data of the root length of these mutants, in which each value is the mean SE of five independent biological determinations and different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05 (Duncans multiple range test) when comparing values within the same ABA concentration.. . . . The abi4 wrky18 and abi4 wrky60 double mutants showed substantially the same intensities of ABA-insensitive phenotypes as those in the abi4 single mutant, and the abi5 wrky18 and abi5 wrky60 double mutants as those of the abi5 single mutant, in ABA-induced seed germination inhibition (Fig. 8A-D) and post-germination growth arrest (Figs 9A-D, 10A-D), which provides genetic evidence that ABI4 and ABI5 function downstream of WRKY18 and WRKY60 in ABA signalling, consistent with the idea that ABI4 and ABI5 are the targets of these two WRKY transcription factors..
