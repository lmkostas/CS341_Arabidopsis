Results. . Seed production is altered in nhx5 nhx6. In order to investigate the role of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 in controlling the trafficking of the seed storage proteins, we examined silique growth and seed production of the nhx5 nhx6 double mutant. The nhx5 nhx6 double mutants were generated in our previous study [49]. Briefly, we obtained one T-DNA line for the AtNHX5 gene (nhx5-1) and two separate T-DNA lines for the AtNHX6 gene (nhx6-1 and nhx6-2) [49]. The double knockout lines were produced by crossing nhx5-1 with nhx6-1 or nhx6-2, respectively, to obtain two independent double knockout lines, nhx5-1 nhx6-1 and nhx5-1 nhx6-2. The absence of the AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 transcripts in these double knockout lines was confirmed by RT-PCR [49]. These two double knockout lines had identical growth phenotypes [49]. The nhx5-1 nhx6-1 double mutant line was used in the following experiments.. Interestingly, besides the profound defects in growth and development, nhx5 nhx6 double mutants had smaller siliques (Fig 1A). The siliques of nhx5 nhx6 were 26% shorter than that of the wild-type plants (Fig 1C). Additionally, nhx5 nhx6 produced less siliques (Fig 1G) and contained less seeds (Fig 1D). The seed yield per silique of nhx5 nhx6 was reduced 29% compared to the wild-type plants (Fig 1D). Similar to what Reguera et al. (2015) reported, we found that nhx5 nhx6 produced larger seeds (Fig 1B and 1E). The seeds of nhx5 nhx6 were 21% longer than that of the wild-type plants (Fig 1E). The thousand grain weight of nhx5 nhx6 was increased by 43% compared with the wide-type plants (Fig 1F). But the morphology of the mature seeds still looked the same as the wild type plants (Fig 1B). These results suggest that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 play an important role in seed growth and development in Arabidopsis. However, there was no significant difference between the single mutant nhx5 or nhx6 and the wild type plants in silique growth and seed production (Fig 1), suggesting that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are functionally redundant.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g001.

We then examined if AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 controlled the transport of seed storage proteins to the PSVs. We used the artificial protein GFP-CT24 as a marker to track protein trafficking toward the PSVs in the embryo of the mature seeds. The artificial protein GFP-CT24 is produced by expressing the construct SP-GFP-CT24 in Arabidopsis. SP-GFP-CT24 consists of a signal peptide, GFP, and the C-terminal 24 amino acids (CT24) of the alpha subunit of beta-conglycinin [10, 51]. beta-conglycinin, a 7S globulin, is one of the major storage proteins in soybean seeds. CT24 contains the vacuolar sorting determinant of alpha subunit. Studies have shown that the artificial protein GFP-CT24 can be expressed and transported into the PSVs in the seeds of Arabidopsis and soybean [10, 51].. To track protein trafficking with GFP-CT24, we generated the transgenic seedlings expressing the artificial seed protein GFP-CT24. The transformants were produced in the backgrounds of wild-type, single mutant (nhx5 or nhx6) and double mutant (nhx5 nhx6) plants (Fig 2). We then compared the expression and transport of GFP-CT24 in the seeds of the mutant plants with that of the wild-type plants. GFP-CT24 fluorescent signals were visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope. In the seeds of wild-type plants, GFP fluorescence predominantly appeared in the PSVs (Fig 2), indicating that the artificial seed protein GFP-CT24 was expressed and transported effectively into the PSVs in the wild-type plants. However, in either nhx5 or nhx6 single mutants, a strong GFP fluorescence signal was observed in the extracellular spaces, while a relatively faint signal of GFP fluorescence appeared in the PSVs, indicating that protein transport is impaired in nhx5 or nhx6 single mutants (Fig 2). Interestingly, GFP fluorescence predominantly appeared in the extracellular spaces in nhx5 nhx6, indicating that the artificial seed protein GFP-CT24 is missorted out of the cells in nhx5 nhx6 (Fig 2). These results suggest that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 may control the transport of the seed storage proteins to the PSVs in Arabidopsis.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g002. Fig 2. . The artificial protein GFP-CT24 is missorted out of the cells of the mature seeds in nhx5 nhx6.. The artificial seed protein GFP-CT24 was used as a marker to track protein trafficking to the PSVs in the embryos of the mature seeds. GFP-CT24 was expressed in Arabidopsis seedlings and GFP-CT24 fluorescent signal was visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Bars = 10 mum.. . . . We next examined the profile of seed storage proteins using SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. We found that nhx5 nhx6 accumulated a significant amount of the precursor proteins of both 12S globulin and 2S albumin (S1 Fig). This result was verified by examining the distribution of 12S globulin in the embryo of the mature seeds using a transmission electron microscopy. The immune EM showed that a striking amount of the unprocessed precursors of 12S globulin were detected in the intercellular space of nhx5 nhx6 (S2 Fig). In addition, we found that PSVs size is reduced but its number is increased in nhx5 nhx6, suggesting that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 may involve in the biogenesis of the PSVs in Arabidopsis (S3 Fig).. All these results are similar to the findings of Reguera et al. (2015) [39]. These results confirmed the notion that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are required for the transport of the seed storage proteins into the PSVs as well as the biogenesis of the PSVs in Arabidopsis [39].. . . Three conserved acidic residues in AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are critical for the transport of seed storage proteins into the PSVs in Arabidopsis. Our previous study has shown that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 contain the conserved acidic amino acid residues in transmembrane domains that align with the yeast Na+/H+ antiporter ScNhx1p [49]. These conserved acidic residues of AtNHX5 (D164, E188, D193 and E320) and AtNHX6 (D165, E189, D194 and E320) line up with the corresponding residues in ScNhx1p (D201, E225, D230 and E355) [49, 52]. We have shown that three of these conserved acidic residues of AtNHX5 (D164, E188, and D193) and AtNHX6 (D165, E189, and D194) are essential for the ion transport activity of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6, and thus play an important role in growth and development in Arabidopsis. We are then asking whether the transport activity of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 is required for the transport of seed storage proteins.. To this end, we expressed AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 genes mutated in these four conserved residues in nhx5 nhx6. The mutations were made by replacing the acidic residues with the uncharged polar residues. In AtNHX5, D164 was mutated to N, E188 to Q, D193 to N and E320 to Q; in AtNHX6, D165 to N, E189 to Q, D194 to N and E320 to Q. Protein profiles of the mature seeds were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot (Fig 3). No precursors were detected for the control plants expressing the wild type AtNHX5 or AtNHX6 gene (Fig 3A and 3B), indicating that the transformed AtNHX5 or AtNHX6 gene functions efficiently in the transport of the seed storage proteins. However, the precursor proteins of both 12S globulin and 2S albumin were detected for three of the point mutations in both AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 genes (D164N, E188Q and D193N of AtNHX5, and D165N, E189Q and D194N of AtNHX6) (Fig 3A and 3B), indicating that these mutant genes were malfunctioning in protein transport. These results suggest that the transport activity of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 is required for the transport of seed storage proteins.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g003. Fig 3. . Three conserved acidic residues in AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are critical for the transport of the storage proteins into the PSVs in Arabidopsis.. (A) and (B) Immunoblot analysis for the point mutations in AtNHX5 (A) and AtNHX6 (B). The point mutated genes of the four conserved acidic residues of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 were introduced into the nhx5 nhx6 background, respectively. Total proteins were extracted from the mature seeds. 10 mug proteins were loaded in each lane. Proteins were probed with anti-12S globulin and anti-2S albumin antibodies, respectively.. . . . Our previous study has shown that E320 in both AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 genes may not be involved in exchange activity and cellular functions, since E320Q mutant remained its activity in conferring yeast growth under both high K+ and hygromicin B, and E320Q mutant fully recovered the growth of the nhx5 nhx6 seedlings [49]. As expected, E320Q mutant accumulated no or little precursors for both AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 genes (Fig 3A and 3B), indicating that protein transport was not or partially impaired in E320Q.. . . Seedling growth and seed development are altered in nhx5 nhx6 syp22. Since AtNHX5, AtNHX6 and the SNAREs VAMP727, SYP22, VTI11 and SYP51 are all localized to the same organelle PVC, we reason that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 may control the trafficking of seed storage proteins by regulating the function of this SNARE complex.. To test this hypothesis, we generated the nhx5 nhx6 syp22 triple mutant (Fig 4). We obtained two separate T-DNA lines for the SYP22 gene (syp22-1 and syp22-3) (S4A Fig). The nhx5-1 nhx6-1 double mutant line was generated in our previous study [49]. The double mutant line nhx5-2 nhx6-2 was generated by crossing nhx5-2 and nhx6-2. The triple mutant lines were generated by crossing nhx5-1 nhx6-1 with syp22-3, and nhx5-2 nhx6-2 with syp22-1, respectively, to obtain two independent triple knockout lines, nhx5-1 nhx6-1 syp22-3 and nhx5-2 nhx6-2 syp22-1. The absence of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 transcripts in the double knockout lines was confirmed by RT-PCR (S4C Fig; 49). The absence of AtNHX5, AtNHX6 and SYP22 transcripts in triple knockout lines was confirmed by RT-PCR (S4D Fig). These two triple knockout lines had identical growth phenotypes (S4B Fig). The nhx5-1 nhx6-1 syp22-3 triple mutant line was used in the following experiments.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g004. Fig 4. .

Studies have found that the nhx5 nhx6 double mutant showed profound defects in growth and development (Fig 4A) [48, 49]. nhx5 nhx6 had smaller rosettes and shorter seedlings, was flowering and bolting late, and produced less seeds (Fig 4A) [48, 49]. In addition, the syp22 mutant is impaired in growth and development (Fig 4A) [53, 54]. syp22 showed multiple abnormal phenotypes, including semi-dwarfism, serrated wavy leaves, late flowering, and resistance to salt stress (Fig 4A) [53, 54]. Interestingly, the nhx5 nhx6 syp22 triple mutant showed much more severe defects in growth and development (Fig 4A). The triple mutant was smaller than nhx5 nhx6 or syp22 (Fig 4A). The height of the triple mutant seedlings was 13%, 40% and 26% of the wild type, syp22, and nhx5 nhx6 seedlings, respectively, when grown in soil for 60 days (Fig 4A and 4F). The triple mutant had short siliques and reduced seed sets, and contained approximately 24% aborted seeds (Fig 4B, 4C and 4E). The triple mutant produced less siliques and seeds (Fig 4G and 4I). However, the triple mutant produced much larger seeds (Fig 4D). The seed of the triple mutant was 85%, 56%, and 45% larger in length than the wild type, syp22, and nhx5 nhx6, respectively (Fig 4D and 4J). The thousand grain weight of the triple mutant was increased by 73%, 53% and 23%, respectively, comparing with the wild type, syp22 and nhx5 nhx6 (Fig 4K). The severe defects in seedling growth and seed production of the triple mutant suggest that AtNHX5, AtNHX6 and SYP22 have an overlapped function in growth and development, particularly in silique growth and seed development.. . . PSVs size is reduced but its number is increased in nhx5 nhx6 syp22. In order to understand whether AtNHX5, AtNHX6 and SYP22 control the biogenesis of the PSVs in Arabidopsis, we analyzed the morphology of the PSVs (Fig 5). The autofluorescence of the PSVs was visualized under a confocal microscope (Fig 5A). For the wild-type plants, the average section area per vacuole is 17.55  6.38 mum2 (mean  SD; n = 654 PSVs in 100 cells) (Fig 5A and 5B). The PSVs in syp22 was slightly reduced: 10.42  8.5 mum2 (mean  SD; n = 665 PSVs in 100 cells) (Fig 5A and 5B). The PSVs in nhx5 nhx6 were fragmented and showed a significant reduction in average vacuole size: 5.5  3.12 mum2 (mean  SD; n = 1647 PSVs in 100 cells) (Fig 5A and 5B). Interestingly, the triple mutant had a much smaller PSV with an average size of 4.52.12 mum2 (mean  SD; n = 2400 PSVs in 100 cells) (Fig 5A and 5B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g005. Fig 5. . AtNHX5, AtNHX6 and AtSYP22 play an important role in the biogenesis of the PSVs in Aabidopsis.. (A) Morphology of the PSVs. Autofluorescence of the PSVs was visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Bars = 10 mum. (B) Histograms representing a distribution of size and number of vacuoles within a single cell. The X axis indicates the areas of the vacuole. Area of each vacuole was measured from the embryo cells of Col-0 and mutants. 100 cells were measured for PSV analysis.. . . . In addition, the number of the PSVs in the triple mutant was increased significantly. While the average number of the PSVs is 6.5 in wild-type plants, syp22 and nhx5 nhx6 had an average of 6.6 and 16 PSVs, respectively (Fig 5A and 5B). However, the triple mutant had a significantly increased number of PSVs: 24 PSVs per embryo cell (Fig 5A and 5B). These results suggest that AtNHX5, AtNHX6 and SYP22 may involve in the biogenesis of the PSVs in Arabidopsis.. . . Precursors of seed storage proteins are accumulated in nhx5 nhx6 syp22. 12S globulin and 2S albumin are the two major storage proteins of the PSVs in Arabidopsis [10, 20]. They are synthesized as precursors in endoplasmic reticulum and sorted to the PSVs to convert to the mature proteins [20]. It is interesting to ask whether AtNHX5, AtNHX6 and SYP22 control the transport of 12S globulin and 2S albumin into the PSVs in Arabidopsis.. To this end, we examined the profile of seed storage proteins using SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Total proteins were extracted from the mature seeds of wild-type, syp22, nhx5 nhx6, and nhx5 nhx6 syp22 seedlings, respectively. The proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, stained with coomassie blue, and blotted with anti-12S or anti-2S antibodies (Fig 6). A high amount of the mature forms of 12S globulin and 2S albumin were detected in the seeds of wild-type plants; but no precursor proteins were detected (Fig 6A to 6C), indicating that 12S globulin and 2S albumin were transported into the PSVs and converted to their mature forms in wild-type plants. A faint band of the precursor proteins of 12S globulin was detected in the seeds of syp22; but the precursors of 2S albumin was not detected in syp22 (Fig 6A to 6C). Interestingly, nhx5 nhx6 and nhx5 nhx6 syp22 accumulated a significant amount of the precursor proteins of both 12S globulin and 2S albumin, while the mature forms of 12S globulin and 2S albumin were slightly reduced (Fig 6A to 6C). These results suggest that the transport of 12S globulin and 2S albumin was partially impaired, and 12S globulin and 2S albumin were missorted out of the cells in nhx5 nhx6 syp22.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g006. Fig 6. . Precursors of the storage proteins are accumulated in the seeds of nhx5 nhx6 syp22.. (A) SDS-PAGE stained with the Coomassie blue. Total proteins were extracted from the mature seeds. 10 mug proteins were loaded in each lane. (B) and (C) Immunoblot analysis of 12S globulin (B) and 2S albumin (C).. . . . . . Subcellular localization of SYP22 and VAMP727 is altered in nhx5 nhx6. In plant cells, proteins are transported to the vacuole through a vesicle-mediated trafficking pathway that includes the ER, Golgi, TGN, and MVB/PVC [50]. Thus, the Golgi, TGN and MVB/PVC are major protein sorting stations in vacuolar transport [55, 56]. Since AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are localized to the Golgi, TGN and PVC, these two antiporters may involve in protein trafficking towards the vacuole [39]. Studies have shown that the SNARE complex composed of VAMP727, SYP22, VTI11 and SYP51 was localized to PVC to mediate the fusion between the PVC and vacuole [26]. Then, it is interesting to ask whether AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are required for the trafficking and localization of the SNAREs VAMP727, SYP22, VTI11 and SYP51.. To this end, we examined the trafficking and subcellular distribution of SYP22 and VAMP727 by transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts (Figs 7 and 8).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g007. Fig 7. . Subcellular localization of AtSYP22 is altered in nhx5 nhx6.. (A) Subcellular localization of GFP:SYP22. The SYP22:GFP plasmid was co-transformed with the PVC marker mRFP:AtVSR5, TGN marker RFP:SYP61 or Golgi marker Man1:RFP into the leaf protoplasts of Arabidopsis, respectively. Fluorescence was visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope. Bar = 10mum. (B) Quantification of the subcellular localization pattern of AtSYP22. The overlapping percentage of GFP:SYP22 signal with mRFP:AtVSR5, RFP:SYP61 or Man1:RFP, respectively, was determined from more than 100 protoplasts obtained from three independent experiments. Error bars represent SD, n = 3. ***P0.001, *P0.05, by t test.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g008. Fig 8. . Subcellular localization of AtVAMP727 is altered in nhx5 nhx6.. (A) Subcellular localization of VAMP727:mCherry. The VAMP727:mCherry plasmid was co-transformed with the PVC marker GFP:AtVSR1 and TGN marker GFP:SYP41, respectively, into the leaf protoplasts of Arabidopsis. Fluorescence was visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope. Bar = 10mum. (B) Quantification of the subcellular localization pattern of AtVAMP727. The overlapping percentage of VAMP727:mCherry signal with GFP:AtVSR1 or GFP:SYP41, respectively, was determined from more than 50 protoplasts obtained from three independent experiments. Error bars represent SD, n = 3. **P0.01, by t test.. . . . For SYP22 assay, GFP gene was fused to the N-terminal end of SYP22, driven by the 35S promoter. The SYP22:GFP plasmid was transiently co-expressed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with the PVC marker mRFP:AtVSR5, TGN marker RFP:SYP61 or Golgi marker Man1:RFP, respectively. SYP22:GFP fluorescence appeared on the punctate structures in the cytosol (Fig 7A). In Col-0, 79% of the SYP22:GFP fluorescent signals were co-localized with mRFP:AtVSR5, but only 10% with RFP:SYP61 and 11% with Man1:RFP, suggesting that the majority of SYP22 is localized to the PVC in Col-0 (Fig 7A and 7B). In nhx5 nhx6, however, the cellular distribution pattern of AtSYP22 was altered: 47% of SYP22:GFP overlapped with mRFP:AtVSR5, whereas 19% with SYP61and 31% with Man1:RFP, respectively (Fig 7A and 7B). These results suggest that a significant amount of SYP22 is trapped in the Golgi or TGN on the way to the PVC in the absence of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6. AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are required for the localization of SYP22 in the PVC.. For VAMP727 assay, mCherry gene was fused to the C-terminal end of VAMP727, driven by the 35S promoter. The VAMP727:mCherry plasmid was transiently co-expressed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with the PVC marker GFP:AtVSR1 and TGN marker GFP:SYP41, respectively. VAMP727:mCherry fluorescence appeared on the punctate structures in the cytosol (Fig 8A). In Col-0, 91% of VAMP727:mCherry overlapped with the PVC marker GFP:AtVSR1, only 9% with the TGN marker GFP:SYP41, suggesting that the majority of VAMP727 is localized to the PVC in Col-0 (Fig 8A and 8B). By contrast, in nhx5 nhx6, 61% of VAMP727:mCherry overlapped with the PVC marker GFP:AtVSR1, while 38% of VAMP727:mCherry overlapped with the TGN marker GFP:SYP41 (Fig 8A and 8B). These results suggest that the PVC localization of VAMP727:mCherry is considerately repressed in nhx5 nhx6. A significant amount of VAMP727 is trapped in the TGN on the way to the PVC in the absence of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6.. . . AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are co-localized with SYP22 and VAMP727. We examined the colocalization of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 with the SNAREs by transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 were tagged at the N-terminal ends with RFP and YFP, respectively, driven by the 35S promoter. The RFP:AtNHX5 or RFP:AtNHX6 plasmids were transiently co-expressed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with SYP22:GFP, while the YFP:AtNHX5 or YFP:AtNHX6 plasmids were co-expressed with VAMP727:mCherry. As shown in Fig 9, RFP:AtNHX5 and RFP:AtNHX6 fluorescent signals partially co-localized with SYP22-GFP. In addition, YFP:AtNHX5 and YFP:AtNHX6 fluorescent signals were partially co-localized with VAMP727:mCherry. These results suggest that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are co-localized with SYP22 and VAMP727.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g009. Fig 9. . AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are co-localized with SYP22 and VAMP727.. (A) Subcellular localization of RFP:NHX5 or RFP:NHX6 with SYP22:GFP. The RFP:AtNHX5 or RFP:AtNHX6 plasmids were transiently co-expressed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with SYP22:GFP, respectively. Fluorescence was visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope. (B) Subcellular localization of YFP:NHX5 or YFP:NHX6 with VAMP727:mCherry. The YFP:AtNHX5 or YFP:AtNHX6 plasmids were transiently co-expressed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with VAMP727:mCherry, respectively. Fluorescence was visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope. Bar = 10 mum in (A) and (B).. . . . . . AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 do not interact physically with the SNARE complex. We next examined whether AtNHX5 or AtNHX6 interacted physically with the SNARE complex by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig 10).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0151658.g010. Fig 10. . AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 do not interact physically with the SNARE complex.. The transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing GFP-tagged NHX5 or NHX6 were generated in our previous study (Wang et al., 2015). Anti-GFP monoclonal antibody was added to the plant lysate to precipitate NHX5-GFP or NHX6-GFP and their binding proteins. Coimmuoprecipitation of the SNARE proteins was analyzed with immunoblot with antibodies against SYP22, VTI11, or SYP51.. . . . We performed the coimmunoprecipitation using the transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing GFP-tagged NHX5 or NHX6 that were generated in our previous study [49]. GFP was fused with the C-terminus of the AtNHX5 or AtNHX6 genes under the control of 35S promoters. The constructs were introduced into the nhx5 nhx6 and wild-type plants. The chimeric genes coding for NHX5-GFP or NHX6-GFP functioned well since transformation of nhx5 nhx6 with these constructs rescued the mutant phenotype [49]. The wild-type plants expressing GFP-tagged NHX5 or NHX6 were used to conduct the assay. Anti-GFP monoclonal antibody was added to the plant lysate to precipitate NHX5-GFP or NHX6-GFP and their binding proteins, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against SYP22, VTI11, or SYP51. As shown in Fig 10, SYP22, VTI11 and SYP51 were not co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-GFP antibody, indicating that there was no physical interreaction between the SNARE complex and AtNHX5 or AtNHX6..
