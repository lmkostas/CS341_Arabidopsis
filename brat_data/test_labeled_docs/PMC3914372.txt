Results. . Molecular and structural analysis of GTS1. . . . Expression profiling and phylogenetic analysis of GTS1. . . The Arabidopsis GTS1 is highly expressed during seed germination and particularly accumulating in embryo, ovule, and endosperm, (Figure1A, B). It is abundantly expressed in meristemic regions, indicating its crucial role in regulating cell divisions (Figure1A). The strong tissue (abscission zones) specific expression pattern of GTS1 (Figure1A) suggests its regulatory implication in plant growth developmental process (Figure1A, B).. . Figure 1. . Tissue specific expression profile and Phylogenetic analysis of GTS1. A). GENEVESTIGATOR-Microarray data showing highly expressed GTS1 gene in embryo, root apical meristem, root tip, abscission zone and shoot apex [24]. B) Experimental expression analysis of GTS1 showing increased transcript accumulation in germinated seed, young and developed rosette leaves and developed flower. C). Phylogenetic relationships between plant genes containing WD40 repeat domains. The GTS1 genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Zea mays (shown in red), belong to a subclade of the dominate clade (gray branches) containing most of the plant genes listed. Genebank accession numbers were used for all genes with the exception of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa for which the Gene ID number from the SALK database were used.. . . . We confirmed that GTS1 transcript accumulates in several major organs, including developing flowers, germinated seeds, young rosette leaves (Figure1B). Microarray data analysis at different developmental stages also reveals an overlapping expression pattern of cell division/growth induced genes with GTS1 (Additional file 1: Figure S1) as highlighted in Table2[24]. These genes are involved in transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes, and various biochemical pathways (Table2). On the basis of the high level of amino acid identity between Arabidopsis GTS1 and other well characterized WD40 protein homologs (Additional file 2: Figure S2), a phylogenetic analysis showed that Arabidopsis GTS1 is clustered with the rice and maize GTS1 (Figure1C), thus indicating that they are more similar to one another than they are to other GTS1-WD40 repeat sequences (Figure1C). This cluster belongs to a subclade of the dominant clade (Figure1C, gray branches) containing most of the plant GTS1 protein homologs.. . Table 2. .

In order to examine the role of GTS1 in plant growth development, we employed a reverse genetic approach using a SALK_TDNA knockout insertion (Salk_010647) of GTS1 gene (Figure2A) to investigate the effect of loss of GTS1 function in gts1 mutant. The SALK_010647 (gts1) line harbored a T-DNA insertion in the first exon of GTS1 gene (Figure2A), which was PCR-confirmed by using the T-DNA-specific oligonucleotide primer LB1 and the GTS1-specific primers (Table1). We next examined and confirmed the knockout GTS1 mRNA transcript levels in gts1 compared to WT using RT-PCR (Figure2B). When compared to the wild type, the homozygous gts1 mutant (n=16) displayed a faster germination rate (Figure2C-F), and a faster growth rate and higher biomass accumulation than the wild type (n=16) (Figure2G, H), indicating that GTS1 negatively regulates cell division, growth and overall biomass accumulation in meristemic regions. Furthermore, gts1 mutant (n=22) flowers earlier (5days earlier) than the WT (n=16) (Figure3A), as demonstrated by a reduced number of rosette leaves (90.6, n=15) compared to the wild type (150.5, n=20) at bolting time (Figure3B). The mutant (gts1) grows significantly taller than WT at the same day post germination (Figure3A).. . Figure 2. . Physical map of GTS1 knockout gene and phenotypic characterization of gts1 mutant. (A) The GTS1 gene with the positions of exons (numbered black rectangles) and introns (thick lines) are represented. The 5 and 3 untranslated regions are depicted in white rectangles. The location of the gts1 T-DNA insertion is shown using an inverted black triangle. The names and locations of primers used for RT-PCR experiments are also indicated. Bar=0. 5kb. (B) The T-DNA insertion causes a knockout expression of the gene. The quality of the RNA and the loading control was assayed by monitoring ACTIN gene expression. (C-F) GTS1 negatively controls seed germination. gts1 mutant germinated faster at 1 and 3 days after incubation in water (D, F) than the wild type (C, E). (G-H) GTS1 controls biomass accumulation and growth development in Arabidopsis. (H), Growth rate of gts1 is faster than that of WT (G) at 15 DAG. gts1 shows larger leaf area (biomass) (H) than WT (G). DAG=Days after germination.. . . . . Figure 3. . Mutation in GTS1 gene promotes early flowering, growth development and biomass accumulation. A) a faster growth of gts1 mutant compared to WT is depicted with gts1 displaying a taller phenotype than WT. B)gts1 mutant flowers earlier than WT as depicted by a reduced number of gts1 rosette leaves compared to WT at bolting time. Gts1 mutant accumulates higher cell biomass than WT as shown by a bigger overall gts1 rosette leaf area compared to WT (B).. . . . In order to confirm that GTS1 is indeed responsible for these phenotypes, we performed a complementation test by RT-PCR amplifying a 1095bp of GTS1-encoding sequence from WT cDNA (Table1), cloned it into the SmaI site of the pROK2 vector [25] in front of CaMV 35S promoter-driven overexpression [26] and stably transformed gts1 mutant background by the floral dip method [27]. As expected, the overexpression of GTS1 in gts1 mutant background was sufficient to abolishes the above described gts1 phenotypes. The complemented line displayed a WT-like phenotype, indicating that this GTS1 is indeed responsible for the phenotypic characterization in gts1 mutant. Unlike the other co-expression gene patterns (Table2), we interestingly identified a strong gene-to-gene functional relationship between GTS1 (AT2G47790) and the ribosomal protein L19e (At3g16780) (Figure4). This data shows the detail of stability of co-expression between the 2 genes. The co-expression was supported by many factors, where the PCA correlation remained unchanged regardless of the growth parameter/factor considered. Both axes are relative gene expression values in base-2 logarithm against the averaged expression levels of each gene (Figure4). These data argue for a strong gene-to-gene functional gene expression, suggesting that these two genes/proteins may physically interact to regulate/control biological processes in plants.. . Figure 4. . Correlation of expression pattern between GTS1 and the ribosomal protein. Samples whose contribution is more than 1.0 are outputted. The probe pair giving highest correlation is selected from all combination between the probes for the two loci, 266466_at (GTS1) and 258410_at (L19e) respectively. Sample contribution score is calculated as a product of z-scored expression values. The average of the score is the pearsons correlation coefficient.. . . . . . . Searching for structural templates. . . Since we confirmed that GTS1 regulates seed germination and growth development (biomass yield, and flowering time) in plants (Figures2 and 3), we next examined the protein structure scaffold and interacting partners of GTS1 in accomplishing its functions. In order to study the physical interactions of GTS1 with other proteins in regulating growth development in plants, we performed a Protein Data Bank (PDB) search for GTS1 protein with known tertiary structure in PDB. The search yielded the crystal structures/PDB accession numbers 2h9l, 3iz6, 3ow8, 2gnq, and 1tbg, showing the highest sequence identity (22, 17, 16, 24, and 15%, respectively). The suitability of selected model was checked by BioInfoBank Metaserver, which returned 3D Jury scores (J-score) of 208.4 (2h9l), 200.2 (3iz6), 198.5 (3ow8), 205.7 (2gnq), and 201.9 (1tbg) for GTS1, respectively. In order to confirm the best possible templates to use for building the GTS1 structure, Swiss-Model server was used, finding high scores (64, 61, 63, 60, and 69) and very low E-values (1.5E-37, 2.1E-30, 4.9E-29, 2E-10, and 1.8E-43) for the templates 2h9l, (3iz6), 3ow8, 2gnq, and 1tbg respectively.. The same workflow was followed to obtain the best crystal templates in order 3D-structural protein model for the GTS1 ribosomal interacting partners. The search in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for the protein L19e and Nop16 yielded the crystal structures of 3iz5, 3jyw, and 3u5e for L19e, and 2aje, 1w0t, 2juh, 2ckx, and 2roh for Nop16, showing comparable values in identity and suitability by BioInforMank Metaserver and Swiss-Model server analysis.. . . . . Quality of threading models. . . To assess the quality of the protein models I-TASSER and Procheck analysis were performed. The I-TASSER analysis gave the accuracy parameters such as a C-score of -0.9, 0.600.14 TM-score with 1848 decoys and 0.1467 of cluster density for GTS1, while Procheck analysis revealed that the main chain conformations of GTS1 protein model were located in the acceptable regions of the Ramachandran plot. A majority of residues (77.6%) were in the most favorable regions, whereas 14.5% of the residues were placed in the allowed regions, and 6.5% were in generously allowed regions. Only 1.4% of the residues were present in the disallowed regions, respectively. The plot of 1 versus 2 torsion angles for each residue showed that most of the rotamers in GTS1 model was localized in low energy regions. iii) The ProSa analysis gave Z-scores of -5.71 for GTS1. The scores were within the range usually found for native proteins of similar size, i.e., -7.31, -4.02, -6.63, -7.93, and -7.33 for the templates 2h9l, 3iz6, 3ow8, 2gnq, and 1tbg crystal structures, respectively. iv) QMEAN analysis of GTS1 model revealed Q-values of 0.67. A quality factor of 0.793, 0.315, 0.71, 0.786, and 0.849 was estimated for the crystal structures of the templates 2h9l, 3iz6, 3ow8, 2gnq, and 1tbg, respectively, indicating that the GTS1 model is within the range of accuracy of the templates crystallographic structures. v) Root mean square deviation (RMSD) between GTS1 model and the crystal templates Calpha backbones of the closed templates were 2.408 for 2gnq and 3.192 for 2h9l.. All of the above parameters were also determined for L19e and Nop16 protein models resulting in comparable structural quality values of our modeled L19e and Nop16 proteins.. . . . . 3D structure of Arabidopsis GTS1. . . We obtained the best structural models of this newly described Arabidopsis WD40 repeat protein, GTS1, based on homology modeling (Figure5). The 3D structure of Arabidopsis GTS1 belongs to the transducin/WD40 repeat protein family because it shares all the structural characteristics of WD40 proteins (Figure5A), which agree with the general crystal structure of 2h9l or 2gnq template. In general, the structure can be visualized as a short, open cylinder where the strands form the walls. At least four repeats are required to form a beta-propeller. In our case, GTS1 contains 7 WDs, where the final and last (i.e., the N- and C-terminal) WDs participate in the same beta-propeller (Figure5A), potentially reinforcing the structure. Despite the low amino acid sequence identity across species, a relatively good conservation of the overall fold (Calpha carbon chain) of this protein is found among plant species and eukaryotes in general [4,28].. . Figure 5. . Structure of GTS1, a WD40 repeat protein. A) Top, bottom and side views of the seven-bladed beta-propeller structure (most stable form) made by using PyMol software (http://www.pymol.org/), with the N-terminal and C-terminal regions in blue and red color, respectively. A depicted model is included to show the basic WD40 beta-sheet structures conformation of the cylinder structure with a tunnel-like structure in the centre that communicate both top and bottom sides. B) 180 rotated views of the electrostatic potential representation on the GTS1 protein surface. The surface colors are clamped at red (-10) or blue (+10).. . . . Surface electrostatic potential analysis (Figure5B) reveals several prominent positively charged residues (blue regions), predominantly in the walls of the cylinder (tunnel) and C-terminal arm. The environment of this protein is essentially negatively charged (red regions) (Figure5B), as highlighted by the Poisson - Boltzmann electrostatic potential. By assigning a value of +1 to basic residues (R, K) and -1 to the acidic residues (D, E), net charge of protein was calculated to be -22 for GTS1. The central tunnel of the GTS1 structure exhibited a predominantly positive charge in the top view. Comparison between GTS1 and other WD40 repeat proteins, such as templates 2gnq and 2h9l did not exhibited large differences in the general topology as it was further confirmed by the RMSD value of 2.408 and 3.192, respectively, whereas significant differences were found in particular regions of the proteins such as the N-terminal, and C-terminal regions.. . . . Conservational and functional/ligand-binding site analysis. The conservational and ligand-binding or functional features of GTS1 were analyzed (Figure6). Surfaces of Arabidopsis GTS1 (rotated 180) showing the conservation index of residues are depicted in Figure6A. Consurf conservation analysis showed that GTS1 cylinder-like beta-propeller structure is quite well conserved, especially the residues located in the core of the structure (Figure6A). The N- and C-terminals of the protein are other most conserved regions of the protein, besides the core area which has a major role in maintenance of the protein structure [9,29]. This distribution of the core conserved region and surface variable residues helps maintain a similar overall fold among WD40 repeat proteins, but also produces differences observed in terms of a multiple protein interactions along WD40 repeat protein, where it is indicated by a discontinued red line for both ribosomal proteins in the GTS1 structure (Figure6A).. . Figure 6. . Conservational and ligand binding domain analysis of GTS1, a WD40 repeat protein. A) Consurf-conservational analysis of GTS1 protein showed in two individual views rotated 180. The conserved and variable residues are presented as space-filled models and colored according to the conservation scores. The interacting area of the protein with ribosomal counterparts has been highlighted by a red discontinue line. B) Detailed view of the ligand-binding area of GTS1 with a peptide and the spatial distribution of the interacting residues in a detailed view.. . . . Figure2B shows a general view of the amino acids in the tunnel-like structure holding up the interacting peptides. GTS1 exhibit the putative active (most representative ligand-binding) site located in the center of the structure (Figure6B, top view), which normally is another interacting polypeptide, containing several conserved but also few variable amino acids. A detailed view, showing the spatial distribution of residues responsible for the conformation of the ligand binding domain surrounding the ligand and directly implicated in this interaction are Y43, V44, F45, S61, N87, S107, F134, V194, S267, R329, and the peptide chain substrate bound to the tunnel-like structure (Figure6B, detailed view at the right side). Conservational analysis of WD40 repeat proteins with significant close identity to Arabidopsis GTS1 among other species returned a large number of highly variable (bold) and small number of conserved (italic) residues as written above. Conformational predictions indicate that the peptide (ligand) is projected to and partially located inside the tunnel-like structure of GTS1.. The conservational and functional analysis of the ribosomal L19e and Nop16 proteins are depicted in the Figure7. Consurf conservation analysis in the Figure6A showed that Nop16 protein is well conserved, especially in the interacting surface region (red arrows, and Figure7B) and the nucleic acids (blue arrow). Only few light and deep blue residues are around the surface of the protein. Ligand-binding analysis of this protein showed in Figure7B highlights the area of the Nop16 protein where the interaction with nucleic acids takes place. This area is located in a cleft integrated by the N-terminal alpha-helix. The residues implicated in the interaction between the protein and the nucleic acid are L40, M41, T142, and R146, resulting in four not well conserved amino acids (italic).. . Figure 7. . Conservational and ligand binding domain analysis of ribosomal Nop16 and L19e proteins. A) Consurf-conservational analysis of Nop16 protein showed in two individual views rotated 45. The conserved and variable residues are presented as space-filled models and colored according to the conservation scores. The interacting areas of the protein with GTS1 protein and ribonucleic acid have been highlighted in red and blue color, respectively. B) Detailed views of the ligand-binding area of Nop16 protein with a chain of ribonucleic acid and the spatial distribution of the interacting residues depicted in both detailed views. C) Consurf-conservational analysis of L19e protein showed in two individual views rotated 45. The conserved and variable residues are presented as space-filled models and colored according to the conservation scores. The interacting areas of the protein with GTS1 protein and ribonucleic acid have been highlighted in red and blue color, respectively. D) Detailed views of the ligand-binding area of L19e protein with ribonucleic acid and the spatial distribution of the interacting residues depicted in both detailed views.. . . . Consurf conservation analysis showed in the Figure7C highlights an equally distributed number of conserved and variable residues along the surface of L19e protein. The area of interaction with GTS1 seems not to be as well conserved as its counterpart Nop16. Few variable residues (blue color) are located in the area of interaction with the N-terminal tail of GTS1 (red arrows in Figure7C). In addition, among the surface directly implicated in the interaction with the ribonucleic acid (blue arrows in Figures.7C, D), S3, K5, I6, R9, L10, N36 seems to be well conserved, since only one residue, I6, was found to be variable (italic), and the rest exhibit an average index of conservation or highly conserved like R9 (bold).. . . GTS1 interaction mechanism: molecular docking analysis with ribosomal counterparts. In order to get insights into the GTS1 regulatory/multi-interacting mode with other proteins, we analyzed the conformational interaction between GTS1 and two interacting partners involved in the structure and biogenesis of ribosomes in Arabidopsis. This analysis was carried out by molecular docking, using newly modeled structures of the two ribosomal proteins.. Figure8 shows the mode of interaction between Arabidopsis GTS1 and the nucleolar protein 16 (Nop16), involved in the biogenesis of 60S ribosomal subunit. The binding mechanism occurs through the formation of a stoichiometry complex 1:1 between both proteins. A detailed view of this interaction is depicted in the magnified views displayed in Figure8A, where C-terminal arm of GTS1 is located inside the cavity made by N-terminal alpha-helix of Nop16 and neighboring helices, in addition to the direct interaction of this N-t alpha-helix with the beta-propeller 4 structure of GTS1. The N-t alpha-helix of GTS1 is covered completely by the Nop16 cleft, therefore preventing access by other interacting partners to this area. On the other hand, it also partially impedes the interactions that are necessary for binding the nucleic acid to Nop16 by stereological impediment. The interaction is non-covalent, thus it may be reversible by increasing salt concentration and/or pH to alkaline conditions. Figure8B shows the large area of interaction covered by the Nop16 molecule in the GTS1 in a perpendicular (90) view.. . Figure 8. . Analysis of the interaction between GTS1, a WD40 repeat and Nop16 proteins. A) The complex between GTS1 (blue surface and cartoon representation) and Nop16 (white/gray surface and cartoon representation) from the top view. B) Surface/cartoon structure rotated 90 in blue (GTS1) and white/gray (Nop16) are depicted, and highlight the large interacting surface between both proteins. C) Electrostatic potential depicted in both interacting partners, where has been highlighted both areas involved in the interaction by light-blue discontinue arrows. The surface colors are clamped at red (-10) or blue (+10).. . . . With regard to energy, the electrostatic potential analysis for the contact surface of both structures exhibited a highly compatible fingerprint distribution of opposite charges, i.e., positive (in the contact area of Nop16 protein), and negative (mainly for GTS1) (Figure8C). There are not large areas with hydrophilic character in the contact surface between both proteins, and the formation of the complex may be mediated by a high number of direct and water-mediated H-bonds.. Figure9 shows the mode of interaction between Arabidopsis GTS1 and the 60S ribosomal protein L19e. The binding mechanism also occurs through the formation of a stoichiometry complex 1:1 between both proteins. A detailed view of this interaction is depicted in the magnified view (Figure9A), where the N-terminal area of GTS1 hugs the thin structure of L19e, and the neighboring alpha-helix contacts the beta-propeller 4 of GTS1. Additionally, the N-terminal area of the L19e protein directly interacts with the residues of the central bottom side of the GTS1 tunnel, leaving the central top side of the tunnel free as detailed in Figure8B. The same area of L19e protein is also involved in the interaction with ribonucleic acid (Figure7D). The electrostatic potential analysis for the contact surfaces of both structures exhibited a highly compatible fingerprint of opposite charges (positive in the contact area of L19e protein and negative in the contact surface of GTS1) (Figure9C).. .

A detailed view of this interaction has been depicted. The surface colors are clamped at red (-10) or blue (+10)..
