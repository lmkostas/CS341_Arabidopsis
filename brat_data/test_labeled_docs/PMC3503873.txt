Results. . The Identification of abs2-1D Mutant. In our previous work looking for genetic suppressors of the Arabidopsis yellow variegated (var2) mutant, we carried out var2 activation tagging mutagenesis [19]. Activation tagging is a modified T-DNA insertional mutagenesis: on one hand it can generate loss-of-function insertional mutants like the traditional T-DNA mutagenesis; on the other hand this procedure is also capable of producing gain-of-function mutants with the inclusion of four copies of the CaMV 35S enhancers near the right border of the T-DNA [18]. The main mechanism underlying activation tagging is the activation of transcriptions of genes adjacent to the T-DNA insertion site. In our large-scale screens for var2 suppressors, we also identified a series of dominant mutants with altered shoot development that we named abs (abnormal shoot) mutants [20]. One semi-dominant mutant, abnormal shoot2-1D (abs2-1D; D for dominant), was characterized (Figure 1A). Both the heterozygous and the homozygous abs2-1D mutants were smaller in sizes than wild type (Figure 1A). One pronounced feature of the mutants was the abnormal leaf shape (Figure 1B-C). In wild type plants, there were clear distinctions between the leaf petiole and the leaf blade, while in abs2-1D the distinction between these two basic structures of a leaf was obscured and a gradual transition from petiole to blade was observed, and the leaves were also smaller (Figure 1B-C). In addition, abs2-1D mutant plants had a consistently higher leaf initiation rate at the vegetative stage (Figure 1A-B; Figure S1A). At the flowering stage, the heterozygous mutants developed shorter inflorescence than wild type and had reduced fertility, producing siliques that were much shorter than those of wild type (Figure S2A-B). The homozygous mutants were sterile under our growth conditions (Figure 1A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049861.g001. Figure 1. . Phenotypes of abs2-1D.. A.

Cotyledons and rosette leaves of three-week-old wild-type, abs2-1D/+ heterozygous and abs2-1D homozygous plants.

Comparison of the fifth rosette leaves of three-week-old wild type, abs2-1D/+ heterozygous and abs2-1D homozygous plants. Leaves were flattened between glass slides before photographing (Bars, 2 mm).. . . . To investigate whether the phenotype of abs2-1D was linked with T-DNA insertion event(s), we carried out a co-segregation test. In a segregating population of abs2-1D, we performed southern blot analysis to see if T-DNA was associated with the abs2-1D phenotypes. Figure 2A shows that for all the plants that had the abs2-1D phenotypes, they also contained a T-DNA insertion, indicating that a T-DNA insertion is linked with abs2-1D phenotypes. Southern blot analysis with various restriction enzymes also indicated that the T-DNA insertion in abs2-1D was likely a single copy event (Figure 2B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049861.g002. Figure 2. . The cloning of ABS2.. A. abs2-1D was genetically linked with T-DNA. Total leaf DNAs were extracted from 16 progenies of an abs2-1D/+ heterozygous plant. The DNAs were digested with HindIII and restriction fragments were separated with electrophoresis followed by transfer to a nylon membrane. The blot was probed with 32P labeled BAR gene sequences. Plants that did not show abs2-1D phenotypes were indicated by arrows. B. Confirmation of a single T-DNA insertion in abs2-1D. Genomic DNAs from abs2-1D plants were digested with indicated restriction enzymes. After electrophoresis and transfer to a nylon membrane, the blot was hybridized with 32P labeled BAR gene sequences. There is one EcoRI site in the probe sequence so two hybridizing bands were observed. C. Cloning of abs2-1D. In the abs2-1D mutant, activation tagging T-DNA was inserted between At2g36080 and At2g36090. Solid lines represent intergenic regions, while white boxes represent genes in the vicinity of the T-DNA insertion. The right border of the T-DNA was facing At2g36080. D. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the expression levels of At2g36080 and At2g36090 in wild-type, abs2-1D/+ heterozygous and abs2-1D homozygous mutants. Actin2 expression was shown as a control. Total cellular RNAs were extracted from the aerial parts of two-week-old seedlings. 1 g DNase I treated RNA from each sample was used for cDNA synthesis. RT-PCRs were performed with indicated numbers of cycles.. . . . . . The Cloning of ABS2. Since the abs2-1D phenotype was genetically linked with a single T-DNA insertion, we carried out plasmid rescue to identify the T-DNA insertion site in abs2-1D. We chose BamHI as the enzyme because of its relatively smaller southern signal size (Figure 2B). Sequencing of the rescued plasmid showed that plant genomic DNA sequence outside the left border of the T-DNA was recovered and sequence analysis showed that the T-DNA was inserted between genes At2g36080 and At2g36090 on chromosome 2, with the T-DNA right border facing At2g36080. The physical distance between the insertion site and the start codon of At2g36080 was 1367 base pairs (Figure 2C). Given the semi-dominant nature of abs2-1D and the feature of activation tagging, it is likely that the genes flanking the T-DNA, particularly the gene outside of the right border, could be the target gene whose expression is elevated in the mutant. We tested the expressions of At2g36080 and At2g36090 in abs2-1D and semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed increased levels of At2g36080 and At2g36090 transcripts in both the abs2-1D heterozygous and homozygous mutant plants (Figure 2D).. . . At2g36080 is ABS2. To confirm whether the over-expression of At2g36080 or At2g36090, was the cause behind the abs2-1D phenotypes, we carried out independent over-expression experiments. Full-length cDNA of At2g36080 was cloned into a binary vector and placed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. This vector was transformed into wild type Arabidopsis and transgenic At2g36080 over-expression (OE) plants were selected at T1 generation and allowed to self. At T2 generation, multiple At2g36080 OE transgenic lines showed leaf phenotypes similar to those of abs2-1D, in terms of the smaller plant size, the gradual leaf petiole to leaf blade transition and the faster initiation of leaves (Figure 3A-C; Figure S1B). In these lines, expressions of At2g36080 were increased to levels similar to or higher than those in abs2-1D (Figure 3D). These results indicate that the over-expression of At2g36080 is likely the cause for abs2-1D phenotypes and At2g36080 is ABS2.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049861.g003. Figure 3. .

Comparison of the fifth rosette leaf of two-week-old wild type, OE-2, OE-3 and OE-4 plants (Bars, 2 mm). D. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the expression levels of NGAL1 in wild-type, abs2-1D/+ heterozygous, abs2-1D homozygous, OE-2, OE-3 and OE-4 plants. RT-PCRs were carried out as in Figure 2D.. . . . . . Phylogenetic Analysis. The ORF Finder analysis showed that the coding region of ABS2/At2g36080 was 735 bp in length, encoding a protein product of 244 amino acids. Sequence analysis revealed that ABS2 is a member of the RAV subfamily of the plant B3 transcription factors and is closely related to the NGATHA (NGA) proteins [9]. In a previous study, ABS2/At2g36080 was named NGATHA-Like1 (NGAL1) and ABS2/At2g36080 will be referred to as NGAL1 hereafter [9]. To further determine the evolutionary distance among the RAV proteins, phylogenetic analysis was carried out and Figure S3A shows that NGAL1 and NGA proteins were in the same clade, among the seven genes in the RAV sub-family that only contain the B3 domain. To support the phylogeny reconstruction, we compared intron and exon structures of all the RAV subfamily genes from Arabidopsis (Figure S3B). RAV genes have simple gene structures with most members only include one exon. Genes grouped in the clade including NGAL1 have relatively complex gene structures of two or three exons (Figure S3B).. . . Expression Profiles of NGAL1. To examine the tissue expression pattern of NGAL1, we monitored its expressions in different Arabidopsis tissues including roots, two-week-old seedlings, rosette leaves, stems, cauline leaves, siliques, and flowers with semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Figure 4A shows that NGAL1 was most highly expressed in the flower and root tissues. Although at lower levels, NGAL1 transcripts were also present in siliques and two-week old seedlings (Figure 4A). Only very low levels of NGAL1 expression were detected from tissues of rosette leaves, stems and cauline leaves (Figure 4A). Our results indicate that NGAL1 expression shows some level of tissue specificity.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049861.g004. Figure 4. . NGAL1 tissue expression profile and NGAL1 protein localization.. A. Expressions of NGAL1 in different tissues of wild type plants were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNAs were extracted from roots, two-week-old seedlings, rosette leaves, stems, cauline leaves, siliques and flower tissues and semi-quantitative RT-PCRs were carried out as in Figure 2D. Actin2 expression was shown as a control. B-E. Tissue expression pattern of NGAL1 examined by histo-chemical GUS staining. Illustrated are one-week-old seedling (B), flower (C), silique (D) and two-week-old seedling (E) from transgenic plants expressing PNGAL1::GUS fusion construct. F. Nuclear localization of NGAL1-GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. Nuclei of protoplasts were stained by Hoechst 33342. GFP fluorescence and bright field (BF) images of Arabidopsis protoplasts were compared to show the sub-cellular localization of GFP (cytosol and nucleus) and NGAL1-GFP (nucleus).. . . . To further investigate the NGAL1 expression profile, we constructed an NGAL1 promoter-GUS fusion vector using a 1.2 kb promoter region upstream of its start codon. Wild type plants were transformed with this PNGAL1-GUS construct and GUS activities were assayed at T2 generation in six independent transgenic lines and they showed similar GUS activities (Figure 4B-E). Consistent with our RT-PCR results, we found major GUS activities in roots and flowers (Figure 4B-C). In the flowers, NGAL1 expression was found primarily in the filament tissues of the stamen (Figure 4C). In the siliques, NGAL1 was expressed in tissues including pericarp, but not in developing seeds (Figure 4D). In the vegetative tissues, NGAL1 expression was found at leaf petioles (Figure 4E). Promoter-GUS assay further demonstrate the tissue specific expression profile of NGAL1.. . . NGAL1 is Targeted to the Nucleus. To study the sub-cellular localization of NGAL1, the full-length NGAL1 coding sequence was fused in-frame at its 3 terminus with the GFP coding sequence to create a translational NGAL1-GFP fusion protein and the expression of this fusion protein was driven by the CaMV 35S promoter. The control vector contained GFP alone, which was also under the control of the 35S promoter. The two constructs were transformed and transiently expressed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts respectively. Fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 was used to specifically indicate the nucleus [20], [21]. For the control vector, GFP green fluorescence signals were observed in both the cytosol and the nucleus (Figure 4F). In contrast, we observed NGAL1-GFP fluorescence signals that co-localized exclusively with the Hoechst 33342 fluorescence, suggesting that NGAL1 is a nuclear protein (Figure 4F).. . . The Over-expression of NGAL1 Leads to the Loss of Flower Petals. Upon closer examinations of the 35S promoter-driven NGAL1 OE lines, we observed that multiple NGAL1 OE lines showed pleiotropic development defects, in addition to the leaf phenotypes. Independent NGAL1 OE lines, including OE-2 and OE-3, showed clear formations of inflorescence after 4 weeks of growth, when wild type plants were just starting to bolt (Table 1; Figure S4A). NGAL1 OE lines also had more rosette leaves at bolting compared to wild type (Table 1). NGAL1 OE lines produced flowers with reduced sizes and flower organs, including sepals, stamens and carpels were smaller in NGAL1 OE lines compared with those of wild type (Figure 5A). Even more dramatic was the finding that strong NGAL1 OE lines showed the absence of flower petals, the second whorl of the typical four whorls of Arabidopsis wild type flower organs (Figure 5A-D; Table 2). There were also intermediate petal phenotypes as we observed abnormal filamentous structures instead of petals in some flowers (Figure 5E; Table 2). We determined that NGAL1 was indeed over-expressed in the petal-less flowers of independent OE lines, correlating the over-expression of NGAL1 with the loss-of-petal phenotype (Figure S4B). Our results indicate that the over-expression of NGAL1 is capable of altering flower development, particularly petal development in Arabidopsis.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049861.t001. Table 1. .

Note the filamentous structure found in some flowers from OE lines (pointed by the white arrow head).. . . . . . Identification of a NGAL1 Loss-of-function Mutant Allele. The phenotypes we observed with abs2-1D and NGAL1 OE lines were the consequences of gain-of-function genetic manipulations. To investigate potential loss-of-function phenotypes of NGAL1, we searched for its T-DNA insertional mutants in The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) and identified a putative insertion line SALK_146872 (Figure 6A). PCR analysis confirmed that the T-DNA was inserted in the first intron of NGAL1 (Figure 6B). We also found that the inserted T-DNA structure likely included two copies of T-DNAs because we identified both ends of the T-DNA insertion as the left border (Figure 6B). Homozygous line of SALK_146872 (named ngal1-1) was identified and RT-PCR results showed that full-length NGAL1 cDNAs cannot be detected in the floral tissues, where NGAL1 was normally expressed (Figure 6B-C). However, we did detect the presence of transcripts using primer sets that do not span the T-DNA, indicating that certain forms of abnormal transcripts of NGAL1 may exist in ngal1-1 (Figure 6C). Although NGAL1 over-expression led to the loss of flower petals, loss-of-function ngal1-1 plants showed no visible phenotypic changes at vegetative stages when compared with the wild type plants under our growth conditions (Figure 6D). We also did not observe abnormalities with ngal1-1 roots and flowers (Figure 6E-F). Our results suggest that the absence of NGAL1 does not dramatically alter plant development and its activity is likely buffered by redundant genes or activities.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049861.g006.
