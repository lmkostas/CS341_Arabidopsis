Results. . Co-expression of three irx genes encoding Arabidopsis xylan synthase. In Arabidopsis, genes IRX9 (At2g37090), IRX14 (At4g36890), and IRX10 (At1g27440) are members of the GT43A, GT43B and GT47D subfamilies. The nomenclature used here for the different clades in GT43 and GT47 is according to Arabidopsis [28] and Brachypodium [29] studies and differs from that used to designate poplar genes [30]. These IRX genes are all expressed in tissues with secondary wall growth and are involved in xylan backbone synthesis [13], [14]. To view the correlation of their expression patterns across many microarray experiments, we performed a scatter plot analysis using CoexViewer based on the 237 data sets related to developmental series in the ATTED-II database (Figure S1) [31]. Scatter plots of pairwise combinations of the three genes showed very similar patterns and strongly correlated expression, whereas the negative control RALF gene (At4g15800), which is mainly expressed in tissues with primary wall growth (e.g. rosette leaf), did not show any correlation with IRX9 expression. To identify other candidate genes likely to be involved in xylan accumulation, we used the CoexSearch tool available at ATTED-II, which uses MR for evaluation of the correlation between two different gene expressions. Table S1 shows the 300 most highly co-expressed Arabidopsis genes obtained for each of the three baits, IRX9, IRX14, and IRX10. Each co-expression list included the three bait genes as strongly co-expressed genes (low MR), and many genes were shared between the three sets of 300 genes, with a total of 124 genes (ca. 23%) shared amongst all three data sets (Table S2; Figure 1A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0015481.g001. Figure 1. . Comparative co-expression analysis between Arabidopsis and rice.. (A, B) Venn diagrams of the co-expressed genes with each of the three individual baits from Arabidopsis (A) and rice (B). (C, D) Expression profiles of the 25 genes that most closely match with the baits (thick lines). To confirm co-regulation, the transcriptional expression pattern of the top 25 shared genes of the 3-way intersection from Arabidopsis (A) and rice (B) is plotted. The y-axes show relative gene expression values in base-2 logarithm against the average expression levels of each gene.. . . . The significance of this tight linkage amongst the three genes was further examined by analyzing other members of the Arabidopsis GT43 (IRX9-L and IRX14-L) and GT47D (F8H, FRA8 and IRX10-L) families [32]. The maximum MR range for the 300th gene had weaker values ranging from 400 to 600 (except FRA8) when compared to co-expression sets for IRX9, IRX10 and IRX14 where the maximum MR was less than 400 (Table 1). Surprisingly, Arabidopsis FRA8, which appears to be involved in forming the oligosaccharide at the reducing end of xylan, did not tightly co-express with IRX9, IRX10 or IRX14. FRA8 produced a tight network with an MR<192.8 for the 300th most highly co-expressed genes (Table 1), but this network did not overlap considerably with the network defined by xylan backbone synthesis genes IRX9, IRX10 and IRX14. Furthermore, the FRA8 network did not include the two other known genes implicated in synthesis of the oligosaccharide, i.e. IRX8 and PARVUS [4], [13] while both these genes were co-expressed with IRX9/IRX10/IRX14 genes.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0015481.t001.

The MRs for all genes are listed in Table S1 and Table S3.. . . . . . Co-expression analysis of GT43 and GT47D genes in rice. To gain a better understanding of the similarities and difference between xylan gene networks in Arabidopsis and in grasses, we also investigated gene networks in rice. Rice has ten and seven genes belonging to the GT43 and GT47D families, respectively (Table 1). Phylogenic analysis clearly separated the ten GT43 and seven GT47D genes into distinct clades, with six genes in the IRX10/IRX10-L clade, one gene in the FRA8/F8H clade, eight genes in the IRX9/IRX9-L clade, and two genes in the IRX14/IRX14-L clade (Figure 2A). We examined the expression of the rice GT43 and GT47D genes in different developmental stages using rice Affymetrix DNA array GSE6893 data [33]. Interestingly, the expression patterns could be clearly defined into two distinct groups (Figure 2B). One type of expression profile was strongly dependent on tissue development stage and had high expression levels in tissues associated with secondary wall deposition. The other type of expression profile had relatively constant expression levels. For simplicity, we designate these two patterns mountain type and flat type expression, based on the appearance in Figure 2B. Most of the genes showing mountain type had low range of maximum MR for the 300th gene (Figure 2B, Table 1). The high expression level in tissues with secondary wall formation and the strong co-expression indicate that the mountain type genes are the likely homologs implicated in xylan biosynthesis in secondary walls, and hence the functional orthologs of the three Arabidopsis IRX genes used for the analysis above.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0015481.g002. Figure 2. . Rice GT43A, GT43B and GT47D genes.. (A) Phylogenic relationship of rice and Arabidopsis genes. Numbers at branches indicate bootstrap values from 500 trials. Phylogenetic tree was built by neighboring-joining method using ClustalW. The IRX10 and FRA8 genes in GT47D, the IRX9 and IRX14 genes in GT43, and their rice orthologues are clearly separated into distinct clades. (B) The Mountain type expression pattern of the genes showing MR<280 for the 300 most highly co-expressed genes (upper panel). The Flat type expression pattern of the genes which showed MR>280 or had no co-expression data available in ATTED-II (lower panel). Os01g0926700 is included in the mountain type because it has a similar profile, although no co-expression data are available for this gene in ATTED-II. The red and blue arrowheads show the genes used as baits for the final comparative co-expression analysis. The y-axes show raw expression values from rice Affymetrix DNA array GSE6893 data [33]. The x-axes show tissue type: R; Root_7d_seedling, ML; Mature_leaf, YL; Young_leaf, P1; Young_inflorescence_P1, P2-P6, Inflorescence stage P2 to P6; S1-S5, Seed stage S1 to S5.. . . . To select the best rice candidate genes for co-expression analysis we identified the IRX9, IRX10 and IRX14 homologs that fulfilled the following criteria: 1) mountain-type expression profile (Figure 2B), 2) lowest maximum MR in the 300 most highly co-expressed genes and 3) maximum number of shared genes. We selected the IRX9 ortholog designated OsGT43A, IRX14 ortholog designated OsGT43B, and IRX10 ortholog designated OsGT47D and used them as baits for co-expression analysis at ATTED-II (Table 1, Table S3). A large number of shared genes were observed in the pairwise combinations (Figure 1B) with OsGT47D-OsGT43B (165 genes), OsGT47D-OsGT43A (121 genes), and OsGT43A-OsGT43B (123 genes). Combining the three genes, 83 (ca. 14%) of the 300 highest ranked genes were shared (Table S4). These genes included well-known genes such as BC1 encoding COBL4 and cellulose synthase genes OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and OsCesA9, which are involved in secondary wall synthesis [34], [35]. Figure 1 (C and D) illustrates the transcriptional co-regulation of the top 25 shared genes for both species.. . . Development of a Pfam-based predictor for plant endomembrane localization. Knowledge of both co-expression of genes and sub-cellular localization of the corresponding proteins contribute to our understanding of protein function and putative interactions. To date, existing prediction algorithms have been unable to reliably predict localization to the endomembrane system in plants. For other eukaryotes, the pTARGET database employing a genome wide prediction method based on location-specific functional domains currently provides the best prediction for subcellular location in the endomembrane systems [36]. Inspired by this technique we developed a predictor that utilizes Protein functional domain information (Pfam) [37] to predict plant sub-cellular localization. The prediction algorithm required a Pfam training set to establish the baseline distribution of the Pfam domains across multiple subcellular locations. The most comprehensive source of subcellular localization data was obtained from the AmiGO database (http://amigo.geneontology.org). To further improve the robustness of the training set, only 2740 experimentally evidenced (i.e. associated with the IDA tag) entries were selected from the 5077 Arabidopsis proteins found in this database. This experimental AmiGO data set was further segmented into groups based upon the subcellular localization associated with the annotation, and Pfam domain information retrieved for each protein. This analysis resulted in data sets that map any given Pfam domain to an experimentally observed subcellular localization. In contrast to pTARGET, the developed prediction algorithm was modified to allow for more than one Pfam domain to contribute to the determination of localization. The pTARGET algorithm bases predictions upon Pfam domains that are uniquely located in specific subcellular compartments. In Arabidopsis, such a method would lead to, at best, 50% of the proteins being correctly localized. By accepting domains that are distributed across different localizations, all loci with Pfam domains can be identified. The trade-off to this method is that the algorithmic detection can become overly broad, and the specificity of the algorithm is lowered. The efficacy of the algorithm is dictated by the size of the training set, and the number of individual Pfam domains that are found in each subcellular compartment (Table S5). Table S6 can be used for the Pfam-based prediction tool. Subcellular localization prediction using Table S6 are performed by finding Pfam domain of a given target protein. For example, a bHLH protein (AT5G48560) has a PF00010 domain and the highest prediction score for PF00010 is 80.9% for nuclear localization. On the other hand, a LRR protein (AT1G67510) contains three Pfam domains, PF000560, PF00069, and PF08263. The highest prediction scores for these Pfam domains are 82.4%, 70.3% and 87.8% for plasma membrane localization, respectively. The final prediction score for this LRR protein for plasma membrane is then calculated as the geometric mean, i.e. the cubic root of (0.824 * 0.703 * 0.878) =0.80.. . . Characterization of the Pfam-based prediction performance. Characterization of the Pfam-based predictor was carried out by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the predictor upon a non-independent set of proteins. Since the algorithm is highly dependent upon the number and uniqueness of Pfam domains to determine localization, the training set was used as a benchmark set to understand how well the algorithm would work in a best case scenario, since all the Pfam domains have already been seen in the training set. Sensitivity across subcellular localizations ranges from 65% (Vacuole) to 85% (Nucleus), while specificity drops down to only 76% (Table S7). To illustrate the threshold-dependency of the algorithm performance, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot was used (Figure S2). Across the different thresholds for including Pfam data in the final calculation, the localization algorithm performs much better than random localization as shown as dotted line on the ROC plots. This algorithm fills a specific need for the predicted localization of endomembrane system proteins. The performance of this algorithm can be readily compared to the best performing predictors as outlined in SUBA, the Arabidopsis subcellular database (Table S7) [38]. SUBA contains pre-calculated localization scores for all Arabidopsis proteins, and the sensitivity and specificity was calculated for the members of the training set for each of the different predictors. SUBA also makes an all predictors call using a winner-takes-all localization call to combine the results from multiple individual predictors. A comparison of this integrated all predictors call with the Pfam-based predictor indicates that the most significant improvements in sensitivity over current predictors are found for the Golgi, plasma membrane, and vacuole (Figure 3A). In fact only the WoLFPSORT algorithm provides any prediction for these locations, but shows a lower sensitivity rate compared with Pfam-based prediciton. This improvement in localization capability is likely due to the various predictors focusing on properties and datasets not well tailored to the endomembrane system. Based on the improvement in the endomembrane prediction, we named this prediction method PFANTOM (plant protein family information-based predictor for endomembrane) and used Table S6 as the PFANTOM tool.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0015481.g003.

A summary of the localization experiments is shown in Table 2. Scale bar=20 m.. . . . . . Experimental validation of localization predictions. To validate the predictions given by PFANTOM, we selected 16 Arabidopsis proteins predicted by PFANTOM to be located in nucleus, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane (Table 2). Thirteen of the Arabidopsis proteins have not previously been examined for their intracellular distribution, whereas the remaining three proteins (ROP7, RIC2, RIC4) have been reported in fluorescent fusion protein experiments to be located in plasma membrane [39], [40] and were included as positive controls. For all 16 proteins the intracellular localization was determined by transiently expressing YFP-fusion proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana (Table 2, Figure 3). For comparison we also predicted localization with publically available web-based algorithms (Table 2). As predicted by PFANTOM, two transcription factors, bHLH protein (AT5G48560; Figure 3B) and SND1 (AT1G32770; Figure 3C) showed the YFP signal in nucleus. AT3G18660 (PGSIP1; Figure 3G), AT4G33330 (PGSIP3; Figure 3H), AT5G01360 (DUF231 protein; Figure 3I), and AT2G38320 (DUF231 protein; Figure 3J) showed the YFP signal in small, moving, and oval dots very similar to what was seen with the Golgi marker (ST-tmd-GFP; Figure 3D), and clearly different from the ER marker (GFP-HDEL; Figure 3F), which showed typical network pattern. We selected PGSIP1 and PGSIP3, which were both predicted by PFANTOM to be Golgi localized, although PGSIP1 has been reported to be a chloroplast protein [41] and the Arabidopsis protein does have an N-terminal sequence that appears to fulfill the characteristics of a transit peptide according to the TargetP predictor. Furthermore, we also selected two DUF231 proteins, which were ambiguously predicted to be vacuolar, but which belong to a large family of proteins, several of which are known to play a role in cell wall structure [42]. For the Plasma membrane and/or extracellular localized proteins, YFP fusion proteins of GH19 family and GPI anchored proteins such as AT3G16920 (CTL2; Figure 3K), AT5G03170 (FLA11; Figure 3L), AT5G60490 (FLA12; Figure 3M), AT5G15630 (COBL4, IRX6; Figure 3N), AT1G67510 (LRR protein; Figure 3O), AT2G28250 (NCRK; Figure 3P), AT1G27380 (RIC2; Figure 3Q), AT5G16490 (RIC4; Figure 3R), AT5G45970 (ROP7; Figure 3S) showed the YFP signals as a single layer surrounding the cytoplasm identical to what was observed with a plasma membrane marker (pm-rk; Figure 3E). Interestingly, CTL2 and FLA11 show oval dots in addition to the plasma membrane signal. These dots were larger than for Golgi and we are uncertain what they represent. The YFP signal of AT2G45890 (RopGEF4; Figure 3T) belonging to the GEF family, which is recruited to lipid rafts for small GTPase activation [43], [44] was not uniformly distributed but observed as large dots associated within the plasma membrane, suggesting an interaction with endogenous membrane proteins. The results show that for 11 of the 13 proteins (16 proteins excluding the three positive controls), i.e. all the nuclear and plasma membrane proteins and for the PGSIP proteins, there was agreement between the predicted location by PFANTOM and the observed localization (Table 2).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0015481.t002.

Sixteen co-expressed genes were selected and intracellular localization was predicted by iPSORT [77], MitoProt II [78], Predotar [79], TargetP.1 [80], and WoLFPSORT [81]. Pfam was the prediction method described in this study, and experimental data are shown in Figure 5.

Intracellular network for xylan formation in Arabidopsis and rice. In an attempt to integrate the localization predictions based on Pfam and the co-expression information from Arabidopsis and rice, we examined the Pfam domain information from the intersection sets identified in the previous sections, comprising 124 and 83 genes for Arabidopsis and rice, respectively (Figure S3A, Table S2 and S4). Table S8 outlines the Pfam annotations in the high-ranking co-expression sets showing an average MR of less than 70. Interestingly, many of the Pfam domains were identified in both co-expression sets, suggesting functional components present in both Arabidopsis and rice. Furthermore, several sets of Pfam annotations were unique to either Arabidopsis or rice and likely relate to distinct features of their cell walls. Lastly, to obtain an insight into the putative functional interaction at the subcellular level, the localization of high-ranking co-expressed components in Table S8 were predicted by the PFANTOM (Figure S3B, Table S6). Table 3 outlines the putative intracellular distribution of each Pfam domain from the co-expression set. The majority of proteins from this collection of tightly co-expressed genes could be assigned to three distinct intracellular compartments, the Golgi apparatus (13 Pfam domains), the plasma membrane (21 Pfam domains), and the nucleus (8 Pfam domains). This information assisted modeling of potential interactions in the context of shared subcellular localization. An intracellular working model was constructed outlining common and unique machinery in both Arabidopsis and rice (Figure S3C, Figure 4).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0015481.g004. Figure 4. . Working model for xylan synthesis and regulatory components for secondary wall development.. (A) Xylan synthesis candidates in Golgi apparatus. The components in this model correspond to Table S3. In general only the larger gene family name is shown, except for GT8 and epimerases, which have many members of different molecular function and include PGSIP, IRX8, PARVUS, and UXS.

(B) Signaling and regulatory components on the plasma membrane to nucleus in mammals, Arabidopsis and rice. The components in this model correspond to genes outlined in Table 3. Proteins with a predicted location score more than 0.65 with common functional domain group in mammals and plants were selected as the components on plasma membrane. For the nucleus, proteins with functional domain typically annotated as transcription factor and with a predicted location score greater than 0.8 are shown in this model.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0015481.t003.

The table shows groups, where at least one gene exhibited an average MR of less than 70. The number of genes corresponding to each Pfam is from the entire co-expression set in Arabidopsis (Table S1) and rice (Table S3). The AGI and RAP codes are listed in Table S8. The predicted location and score are shown according to the Pfam-based predictor. Abbreviations for subcellular compartments are the same as in Table 2.. . . . a)PF01370, PF03005, PF04669, PF03151, PF4577, and PF07779 proteins have been observed in Golgi apparatus (unpublished data) [82]. Based on the references they were categorized into Golgi apparatus, although they showed a low score by PFANTOM.. . . . . . PGSIP proteins are putative glucuronyltransferases involved in glucuronoxylan synthesis. The co-expression analysis identified a number of GTs located in the Golgi apparatus (Table 3, Figure 4). Most of these were the IRX genes already known to be involved in xylan biosynthesis. The four additional GT groups identified were RGP (GT75) and GT61 in rice, PGSIP1 and PGSIP3 in Arabidopsis, and GT31 proteins in both species but most highly co-expressed in rice. The rice RGPs (UAM1 and UAM3) have been shown to be UDP-arabinose mutases [45]. Since arabinose is abundant in rice xylan but has not been detected in Arabidopsis xylan, the data suggest that GT61 could be xylan arabinosyltransferases, in agreement with earlier speculations [1], [46]. The GT31 proteins do not have an obvious suggested function, but they may be involved in synthesis of arabinogalactan proteins, e.g. the FLA11 and FLA12 proteins that are also seen in the co-expressed data sets. PGSIP1 and PGSIP3 proteins belong to GT8 family which in contrast to GT61 and GT31 contains retaining enzymes [47]. PGSIP proteins are only distantly related to the PARVUS and IRX8 proteins. Therefore, the most obvious function of PGSIP1 and PGSIP3 would be as xylan alpha-glucuronosyltransferases, given that a major difference between rice and Arabidopsis secondary walls is the 10-fold higher GlcA/Xyl ratio in Arabidopsis (data not shown). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed an Arabidopsis mutant in the PGSIP1 gene, which is more highly expressed in stems than PGSIP3. The pgsip1 mutant has a T-DNA insertion in the coding region and plants carrying the homozygous insertion were selected by PCR. No functional transcript could be detected in plants homozygous for the insertion (Figure 5). Although no morphological or irx phenotype was observed for the pgsip1 mutant line [11], the monosaccharide composition of cell walls from pgsip1 stems revealed a highly significant 66% reduction in the content of GlcA compared to the wild type (Figure 5c). None of the other monosaccharides showed a difference. We furthermore tested the xylan GlcA transferase activity in microsomes isolated from stems, using an assay with exogenous xylohexaose as acceptor. The results showed that the GlcA transferase activity in pgsip1 was only about 50% of the wild type level (Figure 5D). This data strongly supports the hypothesis that PGSIP1 (and likely PGSIP3 as well) is a xylan alpha-glucuronosyltransferase. Obviously, it will be necessary to substantiate this hypothesis by analysis of an independent allele or complementation of the mutant.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0015481.g005. Figure 5. . Analysis of an Arabidopsis pgsip1 mutant.. (A) A T-DNA insertion mutant carrying an insertion in the third exon of PGSIP1 (AT3G18660) was obtained. White arrows indicate primer-annealing sites used for genotyping of the plants, and black arrows indicate primer-annealing sites used for RT-PCR. (B) No functional transcript could be detected by RT-PCR in homozygous individuals. (C) Cell wall material isolated from the first to the third internode of inflorescence stems showed significantly lower contents of GlcA compared to wild type (Col-0) plants (five biological replicates, values are mean  SD, significantly different at p<10-6 (t-test)). (D) Xylan glucuronosyltransferase activity was determined in microsomes prepared from the second internode of inflorescence stems. Data shown are mean  SD with three biological replicates, each consisting of stem internodes from four plants. The activity is shown in dpm, where the maximal activity determined for Col-0 is about 400 dpm corresponding to 0.15 nmol GlcA incorporated per mg of protein..
