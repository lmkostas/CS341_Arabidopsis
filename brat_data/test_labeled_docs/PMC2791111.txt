Results. . Arabidopsis genotype analysis. Leaf DNA was extracted from individuals of Arabidopsis thaliana that putatively contained a mutant allele (with a T-DNA insertion) and from Col-0 (the background genotype of the putative mutant). This was used as the template in PCRs using a combination of primers specific to either the AAP6 locus or to the T-DNA used for mutagenesis. It was confirmed that individuals of the SAIL line used contain a T-DNA insertion (within intron 2). To determine the effect of the T-DNA insertion in the aap6 locus, the abundance of its transcript was assessed using RT-PCR. Although the predicted 1400 bp amplification product of the AAP6 transcript was readily detectable in extracts from the wild-type rosette leaves, no such product was amplified from aap6 mutant samples (Fig. 1). Amplification products representing a part of a positive control transcript (an actin mRNA) were detected in both wild-type and aap6 mutant samples.. . Fig. 1.. . RT-PCR analysis on cDNA obtained from aap6 mutant and wild-type rosette leaves using: (a) AAP6 gene-specific primers with aap6 cDNA; (b) AAP6 gene-specific primers with WT cDNA; (c) actin2-specific primers with aap6 cDNA; (d) actin2-specific primers with WT cDNA. The four lanes show PCR amplification after 20, 22, 24, and 26 cycles.. . . . Southern blot analysis was carried out using genomic DNA extracts from mutant aap6 leaves in order to determine the number of T-DNA inserts within the genome of this line. The HindIII-digested DNA samples were probed with a portion of the bar gene, which forms part of the T-DNA construct used to produce the SAIL insertion library. The results (Fig. 2) are consistent with the occurrence of a single T-DNA insertion into the genome and the size of the hybridizing restriction fragment is the same as that predicted by the allele model presented (Fig. 2d) where 4.7 kbp separate HindIII restriction sites within the T-DNA and the AAP6 gene.. .

Effects of abolition of the function of AAP6 on plant phenotype. . Whole plant. There were no obvious developmental differences between wild-type and homozygous aap6 mutant plants. However, measurement of quantitative characters revealed some small but significant changes (Table 1). For example, at the time of flowering, the mean rosette width of the aap6 mutant was significantly larger than the wild type and it had a greater number of cauline leaves. Seeds from the aap6 mutant were significantly larger (0.061 mm3) than those from the wild-type plants (0.056 mm3) (P=0.01).. . Table 1.. .

The total amino acid concentration of SE sap of aap6 plants was significantly lower than that of the wild-type plants (56.049.30 mM and 184.7160.45 mM, respectively; P=0.032, Fig. 3). Similarly, the mean concentrations of essential and non-essential amino acid concentrations in SE sap of aap6 mutant plants were significantly lower than those of the wild types.. . Fig. 3.. .

Insert indicates the total concentration of amino acids. Asterisks denote significant differences at P<0.05 in the concentration (mM) of amino acids between wild-type and aap6 mutant plants.. . . . Sixteen amino acids were individually identified and quantified; histidine and valine co-eluted and are reported together (Fig. 3). Lysine, phenylalanine, leucine, and aspartic acid were all significantly lower in concentration in aap6 mutant plants compared with wild-type plants, being reduced to 27%, 29%, 32%, and 20% of the wild-type values respectively. The large variances resulted in non-significance of the differences between the mean values of the remaining amino acids.. The mean osmotic pressures of SE sap of the homozygous aap6 mutant and wild-type plants were not significantly different (0.800.04 MPa and 0.730.04 MPa, respectively).. . . . Effects of the plant mutation on aphid phenotype. . Aphid reproductive performance. Despite the large reduction in SE amino acids, aphid reproductive performance, assessed as rm, was only slightly reduced when feeding on aap6 mutant plants (0.2680.008 compared with 0.2430.008, respectively; P=0.039).. . . Aphid feeding behaviour. The results from the EPG experiments analysing aphid feeding behaviour on wild-type and aap6 mutant plants are summarized in Table 2. The mean duration of individual successful E1 periods (the salivation period which precedes SE sap ingestion by the aphid) was significantly greater for aphids feeding on aap6 mutant plants than on wild-type plants (P=0.01). There were no other differences in any of the parameters measured for aphids feeding on the two genotypes (P>0.05).. . Table 2.. . Summary of EPG parameters measured. . . . . .

The mean duration of individual successful E1 periods (the salivation period which precedes SE sap ingestion by the aphid) was significantly greater for aphids feeding on aap6 mutant plants than on wild-type plants (P=0.01).. . . . . . Honeydew production. The absence of large differences in the EPG feeding behaviour between aphids feeding on wild type and aap6 mutants was paralleled by parity in honeydew production. Aphids feeding on wild-type plants produced 2.50.2 droplets h-1, compared with 2.50.3 droplets h-1 for aphids feeding on aap6 mutant plants. Similarly, there was no difference in the mean volumes of individual honeydew droplets produced by aphids feeding on wild-type plants (10.32.7 nl) and aap6 mutants (11.53.1 nl). The rates of droplet production and volumes were combined to compare the rate of honeydew volume production (Fig. 4). Overall, there was no difference between the volume of honeydew produced h-1 for aphids feeding on wild-type and aap6 mutant plants.. . Fig. 4.. . Rate of honeydew production by aphids feeding on wild type or aap6 mutants over a 12 h period commencing at 08.00 h. Each point is the mean of 14 determinations of droplet production rate SE. ANOVA indicated no significant difference in honeydew production over time or between genotypes.. . . . . . Honeydew amino acids. The mean total concentration of amino acids in the honeydew from aphids feeding on aap6 mutant plants was 17.110.5 mM compared to 2.20.8 mM for those feeding on wild-type plants (Fig. 5); these differences were not significant (P=0.157). There were also no differences in the mean concentrations of essential, non-essential or individual amino acids in the honeydew produced by aphids feeding on each plant type (P>0.05). The mean osmotic pressures of honeydew droplets produced by aphids feeding on wild-type and aap6 plants were similar at 0.840.03 MPa and 0.780.03 MPa, respectively. In addition, there were no differences in the concentrations of total, essential and non-essential amino acids in the haemolymph of aphids feeding on the two plant genotypes (data not shown, P>0.05) nor in the concentrations of individual amino acids.. .
