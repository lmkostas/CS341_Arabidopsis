Results. . AtCBP60g Expression is Induced in Response to Pathogen Attack and MAMPs. We noticed that, according to microarray data, Arabidopsis CBP60g (CaM-binding protein 60-like.g; At5g26920) was strongly up-regulated in response to infection by the virulent strain Psm ES4326 [48]. We used the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to monitor expression of this gene. Figure 1A shows that expression of CBP60g was induced between three and six hours after Psm ES4326 infection, and expression remained high for at least 24 hours. CBP60g expression was also induced between six and nine hours after infection by P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (Pst DC3000), but to a lesser extent. We further investigated CBP60g expression after MAMP treatments. We inoculated wild-type plants with Pst DC3000 hrcC, a strain defective in delivery of type-III effectors [49]. By three hours after inoculation, and continuing for at least 24 hours, CBP60g transcript levels were higher than in mock-treated controls. Infiltration with the purified MAMP, flg22, had an even stronger effect (Figure 1B). These results indicate that expression of CBP60g is induced in response to bacterial pathogens and MAMPs.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g001. Figure 1. .

(B) CBP60g expression in response to Pst DC3000 hrcC or flg22 inoculation.. . . . . . Mutations in AtCBP60g Result in Enhanced Susceptibility to P. syringae. We studied the function of CBP60g using loss-of-function mutants. We acquired two T-DNA insertion mutants of CBP60g, SALK_023199 and GABI_075G12, and named them cbp60g-1 and cbp60g-2, respectively. According to the SIGnAL database (http://signal.salk.edu/), the T-DNA insertion of cbp60g-1 is located in the third exon of At5g26920, while in cbp60g-2 it is in the fifth exon, as shown in Figure 2A. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) showed that the CBP60g transcript was absent in cbp60g-1 homozygotes and only partial in cbp60g-2 homozygotes (Figure 2B), suggesting that neither mutant allele produces functional CBP60g protein.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g002.

(C) Bacterial growth assays using Psm ES4326. Each bar at 0 hours or 72 hours represents data from 4 or at least 16 replicates, respectively. Error bars represent standard deviation from 16 samples. Asterisks, p<0.05. P values were calculated using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. Similar results for the cbp60g mutants were obtained in two other independent experiments. Complemented, cbp60g-1 plants carrying wild-type CBP60g as a transgene; Without transgene; siblings of the complemented plants lacking the transgene.. . . . To test cbp60g mutants for enhanced susceptibility to P. syringae, wild type (Col-0), cbp60g-1, and cbp60g-2 plants were inoculated with Psm ES4326, and bacterial titer was determined three days later. Figure 2C shows that both mutant lines supported significantly more bacterial growth than wild-type plants, but less than the extremely susceptible pad4 plants [22]. The fact that two independent mutations in CBP60g result in similar enhanced susceptibility phenotypes strongly suggests that these phenotypes result from mutations in CBP60g. This idea was further verified by introducing a genomic clone containing CBP60g and its promoter (1093 base pairs upstream of its start codon) into homozygous cbp60g-1 plants. The progeny of a transformant that was hemizygous for the transgene were infected with Psm ES4326 and bacterial titers in individual plants were determined three days later. The average titer in plants carrying the wild-type transgene was similar to wild-type plants, while the average titer in sibling plants lacking the transgene was significantly higher and similar to untransformed cbp60g-1 homozygotes. Pst DC3000 also grew to higher titers in cbp60g mutants than in wild-type plants, and this phenotype was also complemented by a wild-type CBP60g transgene as shown in Figure 2D. Based on these experiments, we conclude that CBP60g is required for wild-type levels of resistance to both Psm ES4326 and Pst DC3000.. . . Expression Profiling of cbp60g-1 Suggests a Defect in MAMP-Triggered SA Signaling. In an effort to understand how cbp60g mutations affect defense responses against bacterial pathogens, we conducted microarray profiling experiments using a customized long-oligonucleotide microarray with probes for 464 pathogen-responsive genes, representing diverse expression patterns [50]. Expression profiling and data analysis using the custom microarray were carried out as described in Methods. First, we compared wild-type and homozygous cbp60g-1 plants 24 hours after inoculation with Psm ES4326. Other than CBP60g itself, there was only one gene (COR47, At1g20440) that was significantly different from wild-type by more than two-fold (Table S1). These results indicated that CBP60g did not have a major effect on gene expression 24 hours after Psm ES4326 infection.. Since CBP60g is also inducible by MAMP treatments, we tested the cbp60g-1 mutant for alterations in gene expression following inoculation with Pst DC3000 hrcC. Wild-type and cbp60g-1 plants were mock-inoculated or inoculated with Pst DC3000 hrcC, and samples were collected after three and nine hours, when MAMP-triggered responses generally occur [51],[52]. At three hours after inoculation with Pst DC3000 hrcC, 31 genes showed differential expression between wild-type and cbp60g-1 plants (q<0.05) as shown in Table S2. At nine hours, 43 genes were differentially expressed (q<0.05). Clearly, the effect of CBP60g on gene expression changes during a MAMP response is larger than it is 24 hours after Psm ES4326 inoculation.. To determine in which sector of the defense signaling network CBP60g acts, we compared the effects of cbp60g-1 on the response to DC3000 hrcC to the effects of other mutations that perturb the defense signaling network. We chose pad4 and sid2, which reduce SA signaling [26],[53]; coi1 and dde2, which reduce JA signaling [54],[55]; ein2, which reduces ethylene signaling [56], and mpk3, which may affect MAMP signaling [57]. Wild-type and mutant plants were inoculated with Pst DC3000 hrcC and wild-type plants were also mock-inoculated. Samples were again collected after three and nine hours. We selected genes with significantly different expression levels in at least one of the seven mutants compared to wild-type, after Pst DC3000 hrcC inoculation (q<0.05; Table S2). Among these, we further selected genes that were induced or repressed by at least two-fold in wild-type plants inoculated with Pst DC3000 hrcC compared to mock-inoculated wild-type plants. For the 88 genes that met these conditions at the three hour time point, the log2 ratios of cbp60g to Col-0, coi1-1 to Col-0, dde2-2 to Col-0, ein2-1 to Col-0, mpk3 to Col-0, pad4-1 to Col-0, and sid2-2 to Col-0 were subjected to complete-linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering [58]. The same procedure was carried out on the 77 genes that met these conditions at the nine hour time point. Figure 3 shows that the effects of cbp60g most closely resembled those of sid2 and pad4, which disrupt SA signaling during the MAMP response. At nine hours, the correlations between the cbp60g to Col log2 ratios and the pad4 to Col and sid2 to Col log2 ratios were 0.75 and 0.68, respectively as shown in Table 1. As PAD4 and SID2 function in SA signaling, these strong correlations between the effects of cbp60g and those of mutations known to disrupt SA signaling suggested that CBP60g functions in activation of SA signaling during the MAMP response.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g003. Figure 3. . Expression patterns identified by agglomerative hierarchical clustering.. The log2 ratios of each indicated sample comparison were used for the analysis.

SID2 Expression and Free SA Levels Are Reduced in cbp60g Mutants. The microarray data also revealed that SID2 was induced by Pst DC3000 hrcC inoculation in wild-type plants (1.74-fold at three hours and 3.02-fold at nine hours), and that this induction was attenuated in cbp60g mutant plants (the ratio of SID2 expression in cbp60g-1 to wild-type is 0.34 at three hours and 0.38 at nine hours). The qRT-PCR results shown in Figure 4A confirmed that SID2 expression was induced by DC3000 hrcC inoculation and flg22 treatment, as we have reported previously [33]. SID2 expression was reduced in both cbp60g mutants, with statistically significant differences observed three hours after flg22 treatment and nine hours after DC3000 hrcC inoculation. Since SID2 is required for SA synthesis during the defense response, we suspected that SA accumulation was also compromised in cbp60g mutants.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g004. Figure 4. . SID2 expression and SA accumulation in cbp60g mutants.. (A) SID2 expression in Col-0 and cbp60g mutants after flg22 or Pst DC3000 hrcC (hrcC) treatment. Each bar represents the log2 expression value relative to ACTIN2. Data was obtained in three independent experiments, each with two technical replicates, analyzed by ANOVA. Error bars represent standard error. (B) Measurement of free SA after flg22 or Pst DC3000 hrcC treatments. (C) Measurement of free SA after Psm ES4326 treatment. For B and C, data from two independent experiments, each consisting of one sample of each type, was analyzed by ANOVA. Error bars represent standard error.. . . . To determine whether SA levels were lower in cbp60g mutants, we measured free (non-conjugated) SA levels in wild-type, cbp60g, and sid2 plants following mock treatment, flg22 treatment, and DC3000 hrcC inoculation. Figure 4B shows that SA levels in both cbp60g mutants were significantly lower than in wild-type plants at six and nine hours following flg22 treatment and at nine hours following DC3000 hrcC inoculation (note the log10 scale). SA levels in sid2 plants were very low and did not respond to treatments. We also measured free SA levels in cbp60g-1 following inoculation with Psm ES4326 or the avirulent strain Psm ES4326 avrRpt2. After Psm ES4326 inoculation, the SA level in cbp60g-1 was only lower than in wild-type plants at nine hours after inoculation (q=0.002) but not 24, and the extent of the reduction at 9 hours was less than in the case of flg22 or Pst DC3000 hrcC treatments (Figure 4C). To verify that the SA difference we observed in Psm ES4326-inoculated plants was not due to enhanced bacterial growth in the cbp60g-1 mutant, we monitored bacterial titers in the plants used for SA extraction. As shown in Figure S2, no significant differences in titer were observed among wild type and cbp60g-1 mutants at 9 or 24 hours after inoculation. After Psm ES4326 avrRpt2 inoculation, there were no significant differences (q<0.05) in SA accumulation between wild-type and cbp60g mutants (Figure S3). Taken together, these results show that CBP60g contributes to SA accumulation during the MAMP response and at early times during attack by Psm ES4326.. . . CBP60g Mutants Do Not Affect the flg22-Triggered ROS Burst, Callose Deposition, or flg22 Inhibition of Seedling Growth. Having observed that cbp60g mutants were deficient in MAMP-induced SA accumulation, we tested cbp60g mutants for defects in other MAMP-triggered responses. Three characteristic MAMP signaling responses are transient production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), deposition of callose, and inhibition of seedling growth [51]. We monitored flg22-induced ROS production in wild-type, cbp60g-1, cbp60g-2, and fls2 plants. FLS2 encodes the flagellin receptor, thus fls2 mutants do not respond to flg22. There was no difference in production of ROS between wild-type plants and cbp60g mutants, while ROS production was abolished in fls2 plants (Figure S4). Callose deposition at twelve hours after flg22 treatment was assayed by aniline blue staining and image analysis. No significant differences were observed among wild type and cbp60g mutants (Figure S5). No callose deposition was observed in pmr4 mutants, which lack a callose synthase [59]. Clearly, cbp60g mutants are not defective in flg22-induced ROS production or callose deposition. Seedling growth is inhibited by flg22. We tested wild-type, cbp60g, pad4, sid2, and fls2 seedlings for inhibition by flg22. We found that cbp60g, pad4, and sid2 plants all showed growth inhibition similar to wild-type plants, while fls2 mutants showed very little growth inhibition (Figure S6). Thus, mutations that reduce MAMP-induced SA production do not have a major effect on inhibition of seedling growth by flg22.. . . CBP60g Is a CaM Binding Protein with the Calmodulin Binding Domain Located at the N Terminus. Five of the eight CBP60 proteins have a CaM binding domain (CBD) at the C terminus [44]. However, the corresponding sequence of CBP60g is poorly conserved (Figure S1). In order to test whether CBP60g binds to CaM and identify possible CBD domain(s) of CBP60g, we predicted its coiled coil domains using the PredictProtein algorithm [60], as this protein secondary structure is shared by nearly all known CBDs [61]. Figure 5A shows the positions of the predicted coiled coil domains.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g005. Figure 5. . Mapping and site-directed mutagenesis of the CBP60g CaM-binding domain..

(C) Helical wheel projection of the CBP60g CaM-binding domain. Amino acids selected for mutagenesis are circled. (D) CaM binding assay of mutated GST-tagged CBP60g proteins. Upper picture, CaM binding; lower picture, detection of GST.. . . . We tested the ability of CBP60g to bind CaM by constructing a GST-CBP60g protein fusion and expressing it in Escherichia coli. Western blotting with anti-GST antibody showed that a protein of the expected molecular weight (approximately 89 kilodaltons) was produced. A replicate blot was incubated with biotinylated CaM. Bound CaM was then detected with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Figure 5B shows that full-length CBP60g protein bound to CaM. No binding was observed in the absence of Ca2+ (Figure S7).. We then tested various CBP60g deletion mutants (Figure 6A) in an effort to locate the CaM binding domain (CBD). Figure 6B shows that a 76 amino acid fragment from the N-terminus of the protein was sufficient for CaM binding. Further deletions revealed that a fragment of only 45 amino acids retained CaM binding capability (Figure S8). According to the CaM target database (http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb), this amino acid sequence does not contain any of the known CaM-binding motifs. However, as shown in Figure 5c, it does contain a predicted coiled coil domain, and it is amphipathic, a property shared by almost all CBDs [61].. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g006. Figure 6. .

Error bars represent standard deviation. P values were calculated using two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. Asterisks indicate p<0.05. (C) Measurement of free-SA after flg22 and Psm ES4326 treatment. Data were pooled from two independent experiments. Samples were extracted from six leaves for each genotype in each replicate. Error bars represent standard error calculated by ANOVA. Asterisks indicate p<0.01.. . . . Previous studies showed that disruption of amphipathic properties of CBDs abolished CaM binding [41],[62], so we further defined the CBD of CBP60g using site-directed mutagenesis. Based on the helical wheel projection of the CBP60g CBD (Figure 5C), we mutated the codons for all four hydrophobic amino acids (three valines and one phenylalanine) on the hydrophobic side to create codons for hydrophilic amino acids (arginine or lysine). As controls we also mutated codons for two amino acids on the hydrophilic side of the CBP60g CBD and one amino acid just outside the CBD. These changes did not affect the amphipathic nature of the predicted helix. Figure 5D shows that loss of any of the four hydrophobic amino acids on the hydrophobic side of the CBD abolished CaM binding, while none of the other mutations had a detectable effect. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that CBP60g is a CaM-binding protein, and defined the CBD in the N-terminus of the protein.. . . CaM Binding Is Required for CBP60g Function in Disease Resistance and SA Accumulation. CaM binding often modulates protein function [40]. To investigate whether CaM binding affects the function of CBP60g in defense responses, we engineered transgenic plants carrying mutated CBP60g proteins that no longer bind CaM in the cbp60g-1 mutant background. We then tested them for defects in limiting bacterial growth and SA accumulation. We transformed cbp60g-1 mutant plants with modified genomic constructs including both CaM-binding (F41K) and non-CaM-binding (V28K, V29R) versions of CBP60g, which were fused to a c-Myc epitope tag at their C-termini. A wild-type version of the CBP60g c-Myc fusion construct (WT) was also made as a control. Primary transformants containing single copies of the transgenes were selected by qPCR, and their progeny were used for analyses. First, we tested expression of the modified proteins by immunoblotting using c-Myc antibody. None of the c-Myc fusion proteins were detected in untreated plants, but they were all present in plants inoculated with Psm ES4326. This was also true for the wild-type CBP60g c-Myc fusion construct (Figure S9A). Thus, the Psm ES4326-induced increase in the CBP60g transcript level is reflected in the protein level. We then measured bacterial growth and SA accumulation in the transgenic plants. Figure 6A shows that 2 days after inoculation with Psm ES4326, bacterial titers in transgenic lines carrying non-CaM-binding constructs were similar to the titers in cbp60g-1, while titers in transgenic lines carrying the CaM-binding construct were similar to those in wild-type plants. We assayed four additional independent transgenic lines for bacterial growth, yielding consistent results (Figure S9B). This shows that CaM binding is required for complementation of the enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype of cbp60g-1. We also measured free SA levels in leaves after treatment with flg22 or infection by Psm ES4326. Figure 6B shows that the non-CaM-binding proteins, V28K and V29R, failed to complement the SA accumulation defects of cbp60g-1, while the protein that did bind CaM, F41K, restored SA to wild-type levels. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CBP60g requires CaM binding for its function in disease resistance and MAMP-induced SA accumulation..
