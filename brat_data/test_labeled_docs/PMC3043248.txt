Results. . Establishment of an experimental system in which nitrate and organic nitrogen can be varied independently of each other. Addition of nitrate to a plant alters the level of nitrate, the levels of downstream metabolites, and the rate of growth. Previous studies used genotypes with low or no NR activity to separate these responses. For studies of flowering, this approach has two disadvantages. First, although low-NR genotypes allow nitrate to be varied independently of downstream events, this is achieved against a background of low levels of N-containing metabolites and slow growth. To study flowering, it would be more appropriate to use a treatment that allows nitrate to be varied in the presence of high organic N, to avoid possible complications due to non-specific effects of slow growth per se. Second, it would be very tedious to screen the interaction between N and existing floral induction pathways in this genetic background, because this would require lengthy crossing programs to generate genotypes that are homozygous for multiple mutations or transgenes. For this reason, we explored whether glutamine supplementation can be used as an alternative approach. In this approach, the nitrate concentration is varied, while supplying glutamine as a constitutive source of N. Addition of 4mM glutamine to Arabidopsis growing on 0.2mM nitrate restored growth to above that seen on 10mM nitrate (data not shown). Other amino acids including asparagine, aspartate, glutamate and alanine were less effective (data not shown).. Figure2 summarizes the response when the Arabidopsis accession C24 is grown with 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine as a constitutive N source on nutrient agar in weak light in a 12h light/12h dark photoregime. The plants were visually scored each day for the presence of a flower bud. At the time when ca. 30% of the plants in a given treatment had started to flower, all plants with a flower bud were harvested for destructive analysis. The remaining plants were visually scored for flowering for the remainder of the experiment. Decreased nitrate led to flowering at an earlier time (Fig.2a), after producing fewer leaves (Fig.2b) and with a lower shoot fresh weight at the time of flowering (Fig.2c). Similar results were obtained for Laer (see Supplemental Fig. S1) and Col-0 (see below).Fig.2Influence of nitrate on the transition to flowering and metabolite levels in the Arabidopsis accession C24 grown with glutamine as a constitutive N source. Plants were grown on medium supplemented with 4mM glutamine and 1 (grey), 10 (red) or 35 (blue) mM nitrate, or on non-glutamine supplemented medium with 0.5 (yellow) or 10 (brown) mM nitrate, in a 12h light/12h dark photoperiod (120mumolm-2s-1) at 20C. The percentage of plants with a visible floral bud was scored each day after germination (a). On the day when about 30% of the plants had a visible floral bud, all plants with a floral bud were harvested. This corresponded to 22, 26 and 30days for plants on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate, respectively (the plant age at harvest is noted above). Key colours corresponding to the different treatments mentioned above are similar to panel a, but in this case it is necessary to differentiate between shoot (clear) and root (hatched) tissues. This material was analysed to determine leaf number (b), shoot fresh weight (FW, c) and root FW (not shown), from which the shoot/root ratio (d) was calculated. The shoots and roots were also analysed for nitrate (e), total amino acids (f), glucose (g), sucrose (h) and starch (i). Metabolite levels in the shoot and root are shown as plain and hatched bars, respectively. The results are the meanSE of 10-15 individual plants per treatment. Total plant fresh weight when ca. 30% of the plants had started to flower was 187, 325 and 554mg for plants growing on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate (Fig.2c, data not shown). This corresponded to day 22, 26 and 30 after germination, respectively. Based on the total plant weight and a seed weight of 0.025mg, and assuming exponential growth over the life cycle of the plant, we estimated an average relative growth rate of about 0.24, 0.22 and 0.21 on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate, respectively. This provides direct evidence that inclusion of glutamine in the medium largely reverses the inhibition of growth in low nitrate. The shoot/root ratio typically decreases in low N, because root growth is inhibited less strongly than shoot growth. It is known that this response is regulated by nitrate. This decrease of the shoot/root ratio occurred when nitrate was decreased in the presence of glutamine (Fig.2d).. Metabolites were measured in the shoot and roots as flowering commenced. Low nitrate in the medium led to a decrease of the internal nitrate pool (Fig.2e), and a general increase of amino acids (Fig.2f). The latter was partly due to an increase of glutamine, but analyses of the amino acid composition revealed that the levels of most other amino acids were unaltered or increased slightly in low nitrate (data not shown). There was also a small increase in the levels of glucose (Fig.2g), fructose (not shown), sucrose (Fig.2h) and starch (Fig.2i), compared to plants grown on higher nitrate.. For comparison, C24 was also grown with 0.5 and 10mM nitrate in the absence of glutamine (right hand side of the panels in Fig.2). In these conditions, low nitrate did not lead to earlier flowering with respect to time (Fig.2a), but it did lead to earlier flowering when this is related to leaf number or shoot weight basis (Fig.2b, c). The acceleration of flowering by low nitrate is masked when flowering is scored on a time basis, because growth is much slower. The impact of external nitrate on internal nitrate levels was similar to that seen in the presence of glutamine (Fig.2e). The levels of amino acids were lower than in the presence of glutamine, and decreased slightly in low nitrate. The levels of carbohydrates in low nitrate were much higher in the absence of glutamine. This is probably due to the very slow rate of growth in these conditions.. . . Interaction of nitrate with the photoperiod. Figure3 shows a more extensive experiment in which the accession Col-0 was grown in long (16/8), neutral (12/12) or short (8/16) day conditions in the presence of 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate on glutamine-supplemented medium. As in the experiment of Fig.2, when circa 30% of the plants in a given treatment had floral buds these plants were harvested for further analyses, and the remaining plants were scored visually for the remainder of the experiment. The times of harvest are noted in the legend of Fig.3.Fig.3Influence of nitrate on the transition to flowering and metabolite levels in the Arabidopsis accession Col-0 grown with glutamine as a constitutive N source in long, neutral and short-day conditions. Plants were grown on 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine, at 20C and a light intensity of (120mumolm-2s-1) in a 16h light/8h dark, 12h light/12h dark or 8h light/16h dark photoregime (long, neutral and short days, respectively). The percentage of plants with a visible floral bud was scored each day after germination (a). On the day when about 30% of the plants had a visible floral bud, all plants with a floral bud were harvested. This was after 22days for all plants growing in a 16/8 cycle, after 27, 33 and 37days for plants growing in a 12/12 cycle on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate, respectively, and after 75, 82 and 116days for plants growing in a 8/16 cycle in 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate. This material was used to determine leaf number (b), shoot FW at the transition to flowering (c), the shoot/root ratio (d), nitrate (e), total amino acids (f), glucose (g), sucrose (h) and starch (i). For details and colour scheme, see the legend to Fig.2. The results are the meanSE of 10-15 individual plants per treatment. As expected, on high nitrate flowering occurred earlier in long-day conditions than in neutral or short-day conditions (Fig.3a). Low nitrate did not alter the flowering time in long days, but led to earlier flowering in neutral conditions, and under short-day conditions, flowering was more rapid in nitrate-limiting conditions (Fig.3a). Leaf number and shoot biomass at flowering were unaffected by nitrate in long days, but were decreased by low nitrate in neutral and short days (Fig.3b, c). The shoot/root ratio decreased in low nitrate, especially in neutral and short-day conditions (Fig.3d).. Using the procedure outlined above, we estimated that plants growing on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate had average relative growth rates of 0.21, 0.24 and 0.23 in a 16/8 cycle, 0.21, 0.18 and 0.17 in a 12/12 cycle, and 0.085, 0.082 and 0.063 in a 8/16 cycle. Thus, inclusion of glutamine in the medium reverses the inhibition of growth of Col-0 in low nitrate, as already seen for C24.. Analyses of plants harvested when flowering was just starting in each treatment showed that internal nitrate fell to low levels in the 1mM nitrate treatment in all of the photoperiod regimes, and remained high in the 10 and 35mM nitrate treatments in all three photoperiod regimes (Fig.3e). The differential response of flowering to nitrate in the three photoperiods is therefore not due to day-length-dependent changes of internal nitrate. The trend to slightly increased levels of amino acids (Fig.3f) and increased levels of carbohydrates (Fig.3g-i) in low nitrate noted for C24 is confirmed in Col-0. This trend is seen in all three photoregimes. As expected, carbohydrates were lower in short days than in neutral or long-day conditions. Amino acids were also lower; this may be due to a restriction on nitrogen metabolism due to a lower supply of carbon in short-day conditions (Matt et al. 1998).. . . Influence of nitrate on flowering in mutants in known floral induction pathways. Figure4 summarizes a set of experiments with mutants and transgenic plants altered in the activity of the autonomous, GA, photoperiod or vernalization floral induction pathways, and with transgenic plants with lesions that affect the floral integrators. All these experiments were carried out in a 12h light/12h dark photoregime, with plants growing on nutrient medium supplemented with 4mM glutamine and provided with 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate. Some of the mutants are in the Laer background, and some in the Col-0 background (see legend). Both wild types show a weak response to nitrate in these conditions. The complete data set is provided in the supplemental material (Supplemental Table S1).Fig.4Summary of the response of flowering to nitrate in mutants in the floral induction pathways and the floral integrators. The percentage of plants with a visible floral bud was scored each day after germination and, in order to get an overview of the flowering time for the different genotypes, the time at which 30% of the plants induced to flower is represented as the meanSD. All genotypes were grown on 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine as a constitutive N source in a 12h light/12h dark (ca. 120mumolm-2s-1) at 20C. a Autonomous pathway (fwa-1, fve-1, fy-1; see supplemental Fig. S2 for the original data), b gibberellic acid pathway (gai, ga1-3; see Supplemental Fig. S3 for the original data), c photoperiod pathway (35S::CO, co2 tt4; see Fig.5 for the original data), d constitutive overexpression of FLC (35S::FLC), e the fca co2 ga1-1 triple mutant (see Fig.6) and floral integrators lying downstream or CO and FLC (ft-7,soc1-1, ft-7 soc1-1, fd-1, lfy, tfl-1; see Fig.5; supplemental Fig. S2 for the original data). The wild-type background was Laer for all the mutants. The response in wild-type Laer and wild-type Col-0 is shown for comparison. All experiments were performed with 11-22 individual plants per treatment. Open circle means that no plant showed floral bud in that condition. Response to different nitrate concentrations was analysed for each genotype (*P<0.05, determined with one-way ANOVA for independent samples). **Pairwise significant differences between means (relative to wild-type Laer) determined with one-way ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison test (Tukeys honestly significant difference test). As expected, flowering was delayed in mutants in the autonomous pathway (fwa-1, fve-1, fy-1) (Fig.4a, see Supplemental Fig. S2 for more data) and a CONSTANS knock-out mutant (co-2 tt4) (Fig.4c, see also Fig.5c) compared to the corresponding wild type. Mutants in the GA pathway (gai, ga1-3) (Fig.4b, see Supplemental Fig. S3 for more data) only showed a tendency. The co-2 mutant that was used carries the transparent testa4 (tt4) mutation (Putterill et al. 1995; Onouchi et al. 2000). This causes a white seed colour phenotype and was used as a visible marker to indicate the presence of the co2 mutation, but should not affect flowering time. These mutants showed a clear tendency to flower more rapid in low nitrate. This response was retained but not strengthened in the GA-pathway mutants. The response to nitrate was significant in the autonomous pathway mutants fwa-1, fy-1, where it was more marked than in the corresponding wild type.Fig.5Response to nitrate in mutants in the photoperiod pathway, and in floral integrators lying downstream of this pathway. All genotypes were grown on 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine as a constitutive N source in a 12h light/12h dark (ca. 120mumolm-2s-1) at 20C. a Laer wild-type, b35S::CO, cco2 tt4, dsoc1-1, eft-7 and fft-7 soc1-1 double mutant. All experiments were performed with 11-22 individual plants per treatment. For colour scheme, see Fig.2. The triple mutant fca1 co-2 ga1-3 is compromised in photoperiod, autonomous and GA-dependent flowering, and does not flower under either short- or long-day conditions (Reeves and Coupland 2001). No floral buds were seen when this triple mutant was grown for up to 90days in the presence of 35mM nitrate (Figs.4d, 6). Strikingly, flowering occurred after ca. 75 and 50 when nitrate was decreased to 10 and 1mM, respectively.Fig.6Response to nitrate in the fca co2 ga1-3 triple mutant. The triple mutant was grown on 1 (grey circle), 10 (red triangle) or 35 (blue square) mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine as a constitutive N source in a 12h light/12h dark (ca. 120mumolm-2s-1) at 20C. 12-15 individual plants were used per treatment. The response in wild-type Laer is shown in Fig.5a. The experiment was performed three times with similar results. For colour scheme, see Fig.2. The photoperiod, GA and autonomous pathways act by inducing floral integrators like FT, FD,SOC1, TFL and LFY (Fig.1). FD and SOC1 have been implicated in the signalling pathway downstream of FT, while TFL is thought to antagonise LFY. Low nitrate accelerated flowering in ft-7,fd-1, lfy, and tfl-1 single mutants (Figs.4e, 5). The only exception was soc1-1, where flowering was hardly delayed. The latter experiment was repeated three times (Figs.4e, 5). Flowering was strongly delayed in the ft-7 soc1-1 double mutant (Figs.4e, 5). The response to nitrate was qualitatively stronger after repressing some of these floral integrators, including ft-7 single mutant and the ft-7 soc1-1 double mutant. These results suggest low nitrate promotes flowering via a mechanism that operates independently of the photoperiod, GA and autonomous floral induction pathways, and that enters downstream of the known floral integrators.. The finding that the response to nitrate is stronger in co-2 tt4, the ft-7 soc1-1 double mutant and the fca1 co-2 ga1-3 triple mutant could be explained if nitrate acts in parallel with other signalling pathways, and its impact can be more clearly detected when their pathways are inhibited. In this case, constitutive activation of other floral induction pathways should override the effect of low nitrate. As already noted, nitrate has a strong impact on flowering time in short days, but little effect in long days when the photoperiod pathway is activated. This indicates that nitrate acts in parallel to and is redundant with the photoperiod pathway. Flowering is also independent of the nitrate supply in 35S::CO mutants, where the photoperiod pathway is constitutively activated (Fig.5b). The autonomous pathway and the vernalisation pathways both act by repressing FLC (Fig.1). The interaction of nitrate with these pathways was investigated in 35S::FLC mutants, which have constitutive overexpression of FLC and strongly delayed flowering. The response to nitrate was abolished in 35S::FLC mutants (Fig.4d).. Summarizing, the promotion of flowering by low nitrate becomes more marked when the other signalling pathways are attenuated or inhibited, but is blocked by constitutive overexpression of FLC. These observations are consistent with the idea that nitrate modulates flowering time via a pathway that acts in parallel with the autonomous, photoperiod and GA pathways, that enters downstream of the known floral integrators, but is repressed by FLC.. . . Response to low phosphate. To investigate whether other nutrients modulate flowering via a similar mechanism to nitrate, wild-type Laer and the fca1 co-2 ga1-3 triple mutant were grown in the presence of excess (3mM) and limiting (0.2mM) phosphate (Fig.7). Low phosphate led to earlier flowering in wild-type Laer (Fig.7a). Flowering in the triple mutant was suppressed for at least 75days in high phosphate (plants never flowered), but was initiated after 30-50days in 0.2mM phosphate (Fig.7b).Fig.7Response of flowering time to low phosphate. a Laer, wild type grown on 1mM KNO3 (n=14), 35mM KNO3 (n=22) or 0.2mM KH2PO4 (n=41). bfca co2 ga1-3 triple mutant on 1mM KNO3 (n=15), 35mM KNO3 (n=14) or 0.2mM KH2PO4 (n=48). Treatments of 1mM and 35mM KNO3 contained 3mM phosphate, so that, were used for comparison to the 0.2mM phosphate treatment. All mediums were supplemented with 4mM glutamine. Plants were grown in a 12h light/12h dark photoperiod at 20 C day/night and 12h of light period. . . Response to abiotic stresses. General stress can also lead to early flowering. To provide further evidence that low nitrate does not act via a general stress pathway, we investigated whether abiotic stresses can trigger flowering in the fca1 co-2 ga1-3 triple mutant (Fig.8). High light (Fig.8a), high temperature (Fig.8b), photochilling (Fig.8c) and continuous light treatments (Fig.8d) lead to earlier flowering in wild-type Laer. Except for photochilling, the effect was similar to or larger than the effect of nitrate in wild-type plants (see e.g., Fig.5a). None of these treatments induced flowering in the triple mutant.Fig.8Response of flowering time to abiotic stress in wild-type Laer and the fca co2 ga1-3, triple mutant.
