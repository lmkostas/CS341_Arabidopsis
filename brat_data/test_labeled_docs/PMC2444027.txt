Results. . Identification of PSI2 as AtPP7. Coarse mapping had located the psi2 locus between two markers at the bottom of chromosome 5 [26]. Using ecotype polymorphism detection, the site of the psi2 mutation was narrowed to a region shorter than 1 cM (Figure 1A). A strategy of inducible transposition was selected to identify the PSI2 gene. Arabidopsis lines containing a single inducible transposon system (Ds 392-13, located at 9.4 cM upstream of the psi2 locus) were crossed with transposase-containing plants to generate random selectable transpositions [27]. Plants positive for transposition, and presenting visible characteristics similar to the EMS psi2 mutant phenotype were isolated. Two candidates combining both characters were identified (psi2-DS1, psi2-DS2). These lines were then backcrossed in WT and tested for allelism with the EMS psi2 mutants. Examination of the F1 and F2 generations revealed that both transposon-insertion mutants were recessive and allelic to the EMS mutants for all the phenotypic characteristics previously identified. PCR amplification with specific nested primers [28], [29] of the circularized DNA adjacent to the Ds transposon insertion site in psi2-DS1 identified a fragment of sequence corresponding to a leftward transcription unit called MGI19.6, and annotated as the Serine/Threonine protein phosphatase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan) named AtPP7 [30]. The Ds insertion in the second allelic transposon mutant psi2-DS2 was located near the right border of the sixth exon of the same gene (Figure 1A; data not shown). The level of MGI19.6 messenger in the WT and mutant plants was determined with a cDNA probe (from EST 122A12T7) through RNA gel blot analysis; results confirmed that both psi2-DS1 and psi2-DS2 are complete knock-out mutants (Figure 1B). The two EMS alleles psi2-1 and psi2-2 display less transcript than the isogenic related C24 ecotype, suggesting that the loss of AtPP7 activity in the chemically-induced alleles may be due to protein sequence variation. This was confirmed by sequencing of the At5G63870 locus in those alleles. In psi2-1 a G to T substitution led to an arginine to lysine substitution, whereas in psi2-2 the addition of a G caused a frameshift in the sequence.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002699.g001. Figure 1. . Chromosome 5 contains the psi2 locus and the gene responsible for the psi2 phenotype.. (A) Rough mapping has located the psi2 mutation between markers LFY3 and g2368 in the C24 ecotype. Transposition of a mapped Ds-element present in the line Ds-392-13 (No-0 ecotype) was induced to identify the PSI2/AtPP7 gene. The Ds sequences in psi2-DS1 and psi2-DS2 plants allelic to psi2-1 has reinserted in the region corresponding to P1 clone MGI19. (B) RNA gel blot analysis of total RNA extracted from WT and psi2 mutants. The expression of the MGI19.6 gene corresponding to the AtPP7 gene was absent in the DS1 and DS2-transposon-induced psi2 mutant. Each line contained 20 g RNA.. . . . The identification of PSI2 as the AtPP7 gene was confirmed by complementation of psi2-1 and psi2-DS1 with a 2.8-kb genomic fragment corresponding to the MGI19.6 gene (AT5G63870). The control transformations consisted of both an empty vector and the most proximal gene called MGI19.5 (AT5G63860) annotated as a GTP/GDP exchange factor. Results showed that only lines containing MGI19.6 (genomic AtPP7) completely revert to WT the psi2 phenotype (Figure 2; Figure S1). Reversion of the hypersensitivity to red and far-red light was further examined in the complemented psi2 plants (Figure 2, Table S1, and Figure S3). These plants were first subjected to high fluence of red light and examined for the presence of light-inducible and phytochrome-dependent HR (Hypersensitive Response) on leaves using microscopy (Figure 2B). Both HR induction and PR1 expression induced by light were reverted in the MGI19.6-complemented psi2 lines (Figure 2B, 2D). The hypocotyl elongation responses under different wavelengths of light were measured for the complemented lines (Figure 2C), as well as the enlargement of cotyledons in red light (Figure S3). Since the complemented lines contain the CAB2-luciferase reporter gene, video imaging was used to monitor the expression of the luciferase gene for CAB gene induction after exposure to short red and far-red light pulses (Table S1) using the conditions described in [26]. In this phenotypic analysis, statistical complementation of the psi2 phenotype was observed in lines containing MGI19.6. For instance, the p-value of the t-test comparing the elongation of C24 and the complemented psi2-1 line (Figure 2C) is 0.63 in low far-red and 0.55 in low red light, indicating strong similarity. The sensitivity of the same lines to short light pulses was reduced to the WT level (Table S1) further confirming that the presence of intact MGI19.6 complements defects in the psi2 mutants.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002699.g002.

(A) Morphology of WT seedlings, psi2 mutants, a transformed psi2 mutant plant containing a genomic sequence of AtPP7, and a psi2 mutant transformed with the control gene MGI19.5. Plants were grown for 5 days in continous light. Fluence rates in mol m-2 s-1: far-red (FR), 5; red (R), 8; D, darkness. Bar: 5 mm. (B) The red light induction of HR-like lesions (arrows) on leaves of psi2 were abolished by the presence of an intact genomic sequence of AtPP7. Plants were exposed to 50 mol m-2 s-1 continuous red light at constant 20C temperature. Bar: 0.7 mm. (C) The hypersensitivity to red and far-red light-induced block of hypocotyl elongation is suppressed in psi2-DS1 transformed with intact AtPP7. Seedlings were grown 5 days under the following light exposure (fluence rates in mol m-2 s-1: low red, 1; high red, 40; low far-red, 0.4; high far-red, 13; low blue 2; high blue, 38. (D) Amplification of SA-dependent PR1 induction in the mutant psi2 is complemented by an intact genomic sequence of AtPP7. Plants were grown for 2 weeks under 10 mol m-2 s-1 white light at 22C and then transferred to continuous red light of 30 mol m-2 s-1 during 48 h at the same temperature.. . . . . . AtPP7 interacts with nucleotide diphosphate kinase 2 (NDPK2). To locate the site of action of the AtPP7 protein in the phytochrome signaling pathway, we conducted a screen for AtPP7-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. Since the central part of the protein (Figure 3A) is highly similar to other phosphatases, only the N- and C-termini sequences of AtPP7 cDNA were used for a screen against a cDNA library of Arabidopsis [31]. Both identified a same interactor in the screen (Figure 3C), whose sequence encodes the Arabidopsis nucleotide diphosphate kinase 2 (NDPK2), a protein that has been shown to interact with phytochrome [32]. Since the interaction screen was conducted with only short portions of the AtPP7 protein, the interaction between the full length AtPP7 and the complete NDPK2 was further studied and confirmed using FLAG-tagged AtPP7 and 6xHis-tagged NDPK2 (Figure S4, Text S1) and tested in vivo using transgenic lines containing AtPP7-GFP protein fusion in the psi2-DS1 background (Figure S2) and a coimmunoprecipitation strategy using anti-GFP antibody to precipitate proteins binding AtPP7-GFP in vivo in dark conditions and after a pulse of 5 min red light at 10 mol m-2 s-1 (Figures 3D, 3E). An Arabidopsis line containing nuclear-expressed ankyrin-GFP fusion has been used as negative control in this experiment. Results of these assays confirm that NDPK2 binds AtPP7 in vivo in a light dependent manner, since no binding is detected in darkness, whereas a pulse of red light induces the association of the two proteins (Figure 3E). Coprecipitation of phyA in the same assay suggests that AtPP7-GFP binds to NDPK2 associated with the light-activated form of phyA, most likely after transport of the complex in the nucleus, as indicated by the strong reduction of this association in darkness, when phyA is mostly cytoplasmic [33].. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002699.g003.

(D) Level of NDPK2 and phyA protein in ndpk2 and phyA null mutant lines and their related wild types grown 4 days in darkness at 22C. Western blot analysis were performed as described in text. (E) NDPK2 and phyA interacts with AtPP7 in vivo. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing either a AtPP7-GFP fusion or a constitutive nuclear ankyrin-GFP fusion were grown 4 days in darkness and exposed to a 5 min pulse of red light 10 mol m-2 s-1 at 22C (D: dark control; Rp: red pulse). Protein extracts from these plants were incubated with agarose-bound anti-GFP antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitated NDPK2, phyA and DET3 were then detected after SDS-PAGE separation on nitrocellulose-blotted gel using specific antibodies. Input samples contained total protein extract.. . . . . . ndpk2 is epistatic to psi2 in the regulation of phytochrome signaling. A double mutant psi2-DS1 ndpk2 was produced to determine whether the modulation of phytochrome signals by AtPP7 depends on its interaction with NDPK2. In this double mutant, a clear reversion of the phenotypic reduction of cell elongation in the psi2-DS1 mutant was observed in continuous white light (Figure 4A), as well as in continuous low red light (Figure 4B), a discriminating condition for the involvement of both phyA and phyB in the psi2 phenotype [26]. This reversion notably affected both the expression of the PR1 gene after treatment with 250 M SA (Figure 4C) and the formation of HR at high light (data not shown). Besides its activity in the regulation of development by phytochrome, NDPK2 is also likely to be the upstream component of the phytochrome pathway controlling the switching and modulation of the SA-dependent defense pathway by light [22].. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002699.g004. Figure 4. . AtPP7 controls the level of phytochrome signals through NDPK2..

Plants were exposed to continuous low fluence rate of red light (1 mol m-2 s-1, shaded boxes) and far-red light (0.4 mol m-2 s-1, grey boxes) for 7 days before measurement of hypocotyl elongation. Dark control: black boxes. (C) NDPK2 controls the modulation of SA-induced PR1 gene expression by light. 3 week-old plants of the described genotypes have been treated with 250 M SA; total RNA was extracted 48 h after treatment (80 mol m-2 s-1 white light) and used for RNA gel blot analysis. Each line contains 20 g RNA.. . . . . . Increased activity of phytochrome signaling in psi2 alleles of AtPP7. A former study has shown that the responses of Arabidopsis to blue light are dependent on the level of AtPP7 expression [34]. Transgenic plants with reduced expression of AtPP7 display a lower sensitivity to blue light, whereas overexpression of AtPP7 does not modify the perception of this light wavelength [34]. These results clearly assign to AtPP7 the role of a positive regulator of the blue light signaling pathway. In addition, AtPP7 also regulates the activity of phytochrome signaling pathway, since a complete absence of AtPP7 as in the psi2-DS mutants trigger a strong increase in the sensitivity of the plant to red and far-red light (Figure 2, Table S1), an effect which is not seen in antisense lines [34]. To test whether the different amount of AtPP7 in these plants caused distinct effects, we compared the blue light response of seedlings containing decreasing amount of AtPP7 expression (Figure 5). The AtPP7 antisense lines (L5, L7), the lines of psi2-DS1 mutants transformed with genomic sequence of AtPP7 but expressing the transgene in lower amount than WT (LXC1, LXC2, LXC3), and the two psi2-DS mutants were exposed to 10 mol m-2 s-1 of continuous blue light for 5 days and their response compared to their level of AtPP7 expression (Figure 5A, Figure S5). Low expressors showed less sensitivity to blue light than WT No-0, whereas the plants with no detectable amount of AtPP7 presented a WT response for both hypocotyl elongation and anthocyanin accumulation. In order to determine whether phytochromes were involved in this recovery in blue light perception, we tested the response of a double mutant phyA-phyB and triple mutant phyA-phyB-psi2-DS1 (Figure 5B). The phyA-phyB mutant displayed a reduced sensitivity to blue (p-value<0.001) and the triple mutant an even stronger insensitivity, comparable to the response of the AtPP7 antisense lines (the p-value of the t-test comparing the triple mutant elongation with the L5 and L7 line elongation in blue light is 0.80 and 0.12, respectively). In white light however, phyA phyB psi2 had the same phenotype as phyA phyB (Figure 5) (p-value: 0.67).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002699.g005. Figure 5. . Blue-light perception defect at decreasing levels of AtPP7 expression is compensated under a triggering threshold.. (A) Different lines of psi2-DS1 mutants transformed with a 2.8-kb genomic fragment of AtPP7 showing a lower AtPP7 expression level than WT No-0 (LXC-1, LXC-2, LXC-3) or a higher level than No-0 (OXC-1) due to positional effect (open squares), have been exposed to continuous blue (10 mol m-2 s-1; filled circles) or white light (40 mol m-2 s-1; filled triangles) for 5 days before the measurement of hypocotyl length and AtPP7 expression. (B) AtPP7 antisense lines L5 and L7 (in Col-0 ecotype) described in Mller et al. (2003), phyA-phyB and phyA-phyB-psi2-DS1 multiple mutants were grown in the same light conditions as in panel (A). 30 g of total RNA extracted from each line have been submitted to RNA gel blot analysis using cDNA fragment of AtPP7 as a probe, and quantitatively estimated by phosphorimaging. The values of AtPP7 expression (open squares) have been normalized using 18S-rRNA amounts and expressed relatively to the No-0 content (=100). Note the reversion of the defect in hypocotyl elongation under blue light in complete absence of AtPP7 in panel (A)..
