Results. . 1. Kinome profiling of MeJA and SA treated plants using PepChip arrays. To obtain the kinome fingerprint of plants treated with defense related hormones, Arabidopsis accession Columbia-0 (Col-0) seedlings were incubated for 1 h and 6 h with MeJA, SA or a combination of the two (SA/MeJA). Specificity of MeJA and SA responses was confirmed 6 h post-incubation by quantification of transcript accumulation of the inducible marker genes PDF1.2 (MeJA) and PR1 (SA), by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). As expected, PR1 expression was up regulated by SA and SA/MeJA, whereas PDF1.2 expression was up regulated by MeJA and down regulated in the SA/MeJA combination treatment, compared to JA-treatment alone [3], [9], [42], [43].. A total of twelve PepChips containing 1178 consensus peptides (in duplicate) were incubated with extracts obtained from three independently grown biological replicates treated for one hour with either control solution, MeJA, SA, or SA/MeJA (Dataset S1). Several peptides showed differences in intensity between treatments, indicating differential phosphorylation (Figure S1). The majority of phosphorylated peptides was phosphorylated to similar levels in all treatments, and supposedly represent general peptides that detect kinase activities involved in basic cellular functioning [29].. Compared to control treatment, we identified 75 significantly differentially phosphorylated peptides upon MeJA treatment, 63 upon SA treatment and 123 upon the combination treatment (for a complete list see Table S1). Surprisingly, many spots were uniquely differentially phosphorylated by either SA, MeJA, or SA/MeJA, and relatively little overlap was found (Figure 1). This indicates that signaling following SA/MeJA treatment is not simply the sum of the signaling that occurs after SA and MeJA single treatments.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.g001. Figure 1. . Venn diagram of differentially phosphorylated substrates upon treatment (MeJA, SA or SA/MeJA) versus control (C).. The individual differentially phosphorylated peptides are shown in Table S1; peptides that are differentially phosphorylated after two or more treatments are represented in the table in subsequent rows. Of the nine (8+1) spots, differentially phosphorylated by both MeJA and SA, all were changed in the same direction, this was also observed for those that were differentially phosphorylated by SA/MeJA and overlap with SA or MeJA.. . . . . . 2. General description of differentially phosphorylated peptides by plant defense hormones. The PepChip analysis showed that 37 substrate residues annotated to detect Tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation were differentially phosphorylated; generally the phosphorylation-level is increased upon each of the treatments (Table SI). Although tyrosine phosphorylation in plants is debated in general, and tyrosine receptors are controversial, examples of tyrosine phosphorylation are present (Text S1). Also Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity in plants is controversial. The artificial substrate Kemptide (RRASLG) is generally used to monitor PKA activity in animal tissues and is shown to be a substrate of Arabidopsis AGC-kinase 2 [44]. Several Kemptide analogues showed increased phosphorylation after the treatments (12 out of 15; Table SI). Two exceptions were the more divergent peptides RRAASVA and RRASS, which had decreased phosphorylation. Other differentially phosphorylated targets of PKA and PKC, together belonging to the AGC-kinases, were generally increased (20 out of 27; Table SI). Substrates of the Casein Kinase II (CKII) showed generally decreased phosphorylation after different treatments (13 out of 15).. Cell Division Cycle 2 (CDC2) is represented on the PepChip by the peptide GEGTYGVVY, which is identical in the Arabidopsis CDC2 orthologue (At3g48750). On this peptide consensus motifs for the inhibitory kinases WEE and MYT (also found in Arabidopsis) are present [45], [46]. MeJA treatment increased phosphorylation of the peptide, which suggests inhibition of CDC2 activity. On the other hand, several CDC2 target substrates were higher phosphorylated after SA and SA/MeJA treatment. One CDC2-annotated peptide was also higher phosphorylated after JA, but another showed lower phosphorylation upon MeJA treatment.. Two substrate peptides present in Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH; DPGTSYRTR and YSGHSMSDP) had increased phosphorylation after MeJA treatment (one also after SA/MeJA) indicating activation of PDH-kinase. Both peptides are highly similar to peptide sequences in the orthologous Arabidopsis PDHs (At1g24180 and At1g59900). For a more elaborate presentation of differentially phosphorylated peptides, see Text S1.. . . 3. Kinome and transcriptome analysis reveals regulation of plant specific processes by jasmonate. Ten PepChip peptide substrates are derived from plant-specific proteins (Table 1). None of the plant-specific peptides showed significantly differential phosphorylation after SA treatment. However, four were differentially phosphorylated after MeJA treatment: an aquaporin water channel derived peptide, a Phosphoenol Pyruvate Carboxylase (PEP carboxylase) derived peptide, a Photosystem II D protein (PSII D) derived peptide and the photoreceptor phytochrome A (PhyA) derived peptide (Table 1). Additionally, peptides of PhyA, PSII D and a Sucrose Synthase showed enhanced phosphorylation after combined SA/MeJA treatment (Table 1). This indicates that the proteins from which these peptides are derived are post-translational regulated during MeJA and SA/MeJA signaling.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.t001. Table 1. .

Footnote: Plant-specific peptide-substrates are shown that are increased () or decreased () phosphoryated (P) compared to control (C). Peptide sequence (motif), phosphorylation site (P-Site), predicted kinase to phosphorylate the target peptide, and target protein from which the peptide sequence is derived (SWISS annotation) are indicated as presented in supporting PepScan documentation (www.pepscanpresto.com). Significant differences in phosphorylation (p<0.05) compared to control (C) were determined using a Student's t-Test on three replicates of plants grown at different moments in time.. . . . The MeJA control of photosynthesis and light-related factors as suggested by kinomics is supported by transcriptomics data. Re-evaluation of previously published microarray data [1], [47] by MapMan analysis revealed that the significantly (p<0.05) altered bins in plants incubated for 1 h with MeJA, were stress, signaling and photosynthesis (PS; Table 2). After 3 h and 6 h incubation several other bins became significantly altered. PS and stress were the only ones that remained significantly different at all tested time points. The PS bin contains three sub-bins (Table S2). At all time points the light reaction bin (1.1) was significantly different. Within this sub-bin, PSII (bin 1.1.1) was consistently significantly down regulated after MeJA treatment. In addition, light signaling (bin 30.11, harboring among others the phytochrome photoreceptors) was also significantly down regulated after 3 h (p=1.15E-2) and 6 h (p=1.01E-3) of MeJA treatment. Genes involved in SA, ET and JA metabolism are grouped in bin 17 (hormone metabolism) which was significantly different at 3 h and 6 h after MeJA treatment (Table S3). As expected, MeJA induced several JA biosynthetic genes [48] (e.g. LOX2, data not shown).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.t002. Table 2. .

Footnote: Bins show clusters of genes (elements) designated to a bin, and the probability that the genes within the bin are differentially expressed upon 1 h, 3 h and 6 h MeJA treatment. Significant probabilities (p<0.05) are designated in bold.. . . . These transcriptomics data corroborate our PepChip results, suggesting that MeJA influences light-related factors. It seems that this occurs at both the transcriptional and posttranslational level. Together, these results predict interaction between the JA pathway and light signaling, which is in accordance with recently published data [25].. . . 4. Jasmonate controls low light-induced differential hyponastic petiole growth. To confirm the predicted interaction between JA and SA/MeJA signaling and light signaling, we tested interference of MeJA with low light intensity-induced upward leaf movement (hyponastic growth), as this response is controlled by both PhyA and photosynthesis-related signals [40], [41], [49].. First, we assessed if MeJA had an effect on petiole angles under standard light conditions (200 mol m-2 s-1). Vegetative Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were soil drenched with 100 M MeJA or mock (control) solution 1 h prior to the start of observation. Kinetics of petiole movement was subsequently monitored during the next 24 h using a time-lapse camera-setup [40], [50]. In control conditions, petiole angles slightly decreased over time due to aging and diurnal effects [40]. This decrease was enhanced by MeJA (Figure 2A; Figure 3).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.g002. Figure 2. . MeJA effects on light controlled leaf movements.. (A-F) effect of (1 h) pre-treatment with 100 M MeJA (closed circles), compared to mock (open circles), or (G-I) infestation with Pieris rapae (closed triangles) caterpillars compared to control (open triangles), on Arabidopsis petiole angles. Plants were (A,F) in standard light (200 mol m-2 s-1) or (B-E,G-I): treated with low light (200 mol m-2 s-1 to 15 mol m-2 s-1). (A,B,G) Col-0 wild type; (F) Col-0 wild type treated with 10 M 3-(3,4-dichlorphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU); (D,I) coi1-1; (C) Landsberg erecta (Ler) wild type; (E) phytochrome A (phyA-201) mutant (in Ler); (H) Col-5 wild type. Note that the Y-axis in panel (A) is different from the other panels (b-i) as here the angle relative to the horizontal is depicted, as opposed to (B-I) which shows pair-wise subtracted values per time point for the corresponding response in control conditions. Error bars represent SE, n>12 petioles.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.g003. Figure 3. . Typical effects of MeJA on leaf movement.. Hyponastic growth phenotype of Arabidopsis Col-0 in control conditions or after 10 h low light (LL; 200 mol m-2 s-1 to 20 mol m-2 s-1) treatment in the presence of MeJA, or a mock solution. Note that the petiole-lamina border was painted to facilitate time-lapse measurement of leaf angle kinetics.. . . . Hyponastic growth, as induced by low light-intensity (reduction of the photosynthetic active radiation from 200- to 15 mol m-2 s-1), was repressed by MeJA in both Col-0 and Landsberg erecta (Ler) (Figure 2B, C; Figure 3). Initially, leaf inclination keeps track of non-MeJA treated plants, but after 8 h, the MeJA-treated plants reached equilibrium, whereas petiole angles in non-MeJA treated plants steadily increased. As expected, MeJA did not affect low light-induced hyponastic growth in the JA-insensitive coronatine insensitive1-1 receptor mutant (coi1-1 in Col-5) [51] (Figure 2D). This confirms that JA signaling is involved in the repression of low light-induced hyponastic growth. MeJA did also not influence hyponastic growth induced by low light in the phya mutant background (in Ler; Figure 2E), indicating the involvement of PhyA in the interference of JA signaling with this response.. To investigate the involvement of photosynthesis signaling in the observed phenomenon, we repressed photosynthetic electron transport by 3-(3,4-dichlorphenyl)-1, 1-dimethylurea (DCMU). This results in a hyponastic growth phenotype under standard light conditions and is indicative for the involvement of photosynthesis-related signals in the control of petiole angles [41]. Application of MeJA to DCMU treated plants suppressed the DCMU-induced hyponastic response (Figure 2F), indicating that MeJA interferes with signals originating from reduced photosynthesis.. Tissue chewing caterpillars such as larvae of the small cabbage white butterfly Pieris rapae, induce JA accumulation in Arabidopsis [1]. P. rapae was applied to Col-0 plants 20 h before the switch to low light. Severe damage (of each leaf 50% was eaten) was visible at the start of the low light treatment (data not shown) and was comparable in Col-0 and Col-5 plants that lack trichomes [52]. Hyponastic growth was repressed by P. rapae in a similar manner as was seen for MeJA (Figure 2B, G, H). When P. rapae infested JA-signaling deficient coi1-1 plants, the hyponastic response to low light conditions was not influenced (Figure 2I). This suggests that the reduction of hyponasty as seen after P. rapae infestation is a direct consequence of the JA response induced by the caterpillar and is not resulting from physical damage.. Together, the data on hyponastic growth support the kinome- and transctiptome-derived predictions that MeJA interferes with light-signalling.. . . 5. Salicylate suppresses hyponastic growth to low light synergistically to jasmonate. The PepChip data showed no significant changes in phosphorylation of plant-specific substrate peptides after SA treatment. However, a non-significant increase in phosphorylation of the PhyA and PSII D peptides was observed (data not shown) and the combined treatment (SA/MeJA) resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylation of both peptides (Table 1).. Application of SA to Arabidopsis plants suppressed low light-induced hyponastic growth (Figure 4A), similar to MeJA treatment. The combination SA/MeJA showed synergism, since this resulted in complete abolishment of the hyponastic growth response (Figure 4B). The SA-insensitive non-expresser of PR genes 1 (npr1-1) mutant showed a normal low-light induced hyponastic growth response in the presence of SA (Figure 4D). This indicates that the repression by SA depends on intact SA signaling routes. MeJA repressed low light-induced hyponastic growth in npr1-1 (Figure 4C). Vice versa, SA application to the JA-signaling mutant coi1-1 led to repression of low light-induced hyponastic growth (Figure 4E).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.g004. Figure 4. . SA and SA/MeJA effects on light-controlled leaf movements.. (A,D,E) Effect of 1 h pre-treatment with 1 mM SA (closed circles), (C) 100 M MeJA (closed squares) and (b) the combination SA + MeJA (SA/MeJA, 100 M, closed squares) compared to mock (open symbols), on Arabidopsis petiole angles in low light. (A,B) Col-0 wild type; (C,D) npr1-1; (E) coi1-1. Values were pair-wise subtracted per time point for the corresponding response in control conditions. Error bars represent SE, n>12 petioles.. . . . Together, these data suggest that besides JA, also SA is a modulator of light intensity-dependent differential petiole growth. Furthermore, MeJA and SA appear to act additive and exert their function via at least partially different JA- and SA-specific signaling routes..
