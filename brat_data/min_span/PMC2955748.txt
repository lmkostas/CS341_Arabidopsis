Results. . The coi1-16 mutant shows reduced response to ACC-induced root growth inhibition. Seedlings of Arabidopsis accession Col gl (wild-type) and the mutant coi1-16 were grown in CL on media containing a range of compounds at concentrations that inhibit root growth, including MeJA, ACC, EBR, SA, and the cytokinin BAP, and their root growth was compared. coi1-16 displayed significantly less response than the wild-type to root growth inhibition induced by MeJA and by ACC (Figs 1, 2A). These results suggest that COI1 is required for part of the ACC-induced root growth inhibition and for most if not all of the MeJA-induced root growth inhibition. The role of COI1 on root growth in response to ACC was investigated.. . Fig. 1.. . Effect of various root growth inhibitors on coi1-16. Seedlings were grown for 7d in continuous light (CL) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar supplemented with either methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), epi-brassinolide (EBR), salicylic acid (SA), or the cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) at the indicated concentration. Root lengths of treated seedlings compared with that of control seedlings are expressed as the mean of relative root growth (%, n 23). Bars indicate the standard error (SE).

The scale bar indicates 5mm.. . . . . . ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition is via ethylene and does not require JA biosynthesis and perception. ACC is the direct precursor of ethylene. Tests were therefore carried out to determine whether ethylene had similar effects to ACC on root growth of wild-type and coi1-16 seedlings. Ethylene, like ACC, induced root growth inhibition in the wild-type but to a lesser extent in coi1-16 (54.4% root growth for the wild-type and 69.5% for coi1-16, P <0.05). This suggests that the reduced response of coi1-16 to ACC is due to its reduced response to ethylene.. COI1 is required for most JA responses reported, including JA-induced root growth inhibition. If ethylene enhanced JA biosynthesis, as is found in tomato (Sivasankar et al., 2000), then this could account for the reduced response of coi1-16 to ACC-induced root growth inhibition. To test this possibility, experiments were conducted to examine whether ACC also inhibited root growth in the JA biosynthesis mutants allene oxide synthase (aos) (Park et al., 2002; von Malek et al., 2002) and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (opr3) (Stintzi and Browse, 2000). Both mutants showed a wild-type (Col gl for aos, and Ws-0 for opr3) response to ACC-induced root growth inhibition (Table 1). This indicates that JA synthesis is not required for the ACC-induced, COI1-mediated response. JASMONATE RESISTANT1 (JAR1) (Staswick et al., 1998) encodes a JA-amido synthetase which catalyses the formation of biologically active JA-Ile conjugate (Staswick and Tiryaki, 2004), and JASMONATE INSENSITIVE1 (JIN1) (Berger et al., 1996) encodes an ATMYC2 transcriptional activator (Lorenzo et al., 2004). The mutants jar1-1 and jin1 showed a wild-type response to ACC-induced root growth inhibition (Table 1). This indicates that COI1, but not JAR1 or JIN1, is required for response to ACC.. .

If the gene is/is not required in each light condition this is indicated as +/-.. . . . . . Light is required for ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition. COI1 is required for part of ACC- and ethylene-induced root growth inhibition. Experiments were therefore carried out to investigate whether the ethylene receptor ETR1 was also required for this response. A dominant mutant, etr1-1, was less responsive to ACC-induced root growth inhibition in continuous darkness (CD), as reported (Chang et al., 1993), but was only marginally less responsive than the wild-type in the light (Table 1; Figs 2B, 3A). In contrast, coi1-16 had a wild-type response to ACC in the dark (Table 1; Fig. 3A) as reported (Ellis and Turner, 2002). To test whether COI1 and ETR1 contributed additively to the ACC-induced, light-dependent root growth inhibition, the etr1-1;coi1-16 double mutant was constructed. etr1-1;coi1-16 showed reduced response to MeJA both in the light and in the dark, and was unresponsiveness to ACC in the dark (Fig. 3A), as expected from the phenotypes of the parental single mutants. However, the double mutant was less responsive than either coi1-16 or etr1-1 to ACC in terms of root growth in the light (Table 1; Figs 2B, 3A). This shows that the coi1-16 and etr1-1 mutations contribute additively to unresponsiveness to ACC in the light. Since this coi1-16 mutant line, from which the double mutant was constructed, was later found to contain a second mutation, pen2 (Westphal et al., 2008), seedlings containing a single coi1-16 mutant allele were treated with silver thiosulphate (STS) solution to inhibit ethylene perception in the light. STS restored root growth of ACC-treated wild-type and coi1-16 to 62.33.0% and 85.03.1%, respectively. Evidently, in the light, when the ethylene signalling is abolished by the etr1 mutation, or by silver ions, there remains a response to ethylene which requires COI1.. . Fig. 3.. .

An additional interaction between COI1 and ETR1 was observed: on media containing MeJA, and in the dark, the percentage germination of the wild-type, etr1-1, and etr1-1;coi1-16 was 96, 3.3, and 86.7%, respectively (Table 2). A similar, though less extreme, pattern was observed in the light. Evidently, the ability of ETR1 to bind ethylene and, in turn, activation of its downstream pathway, antagonises the effect of JA-induced, COI1-mediated germination inhibition.. . Table 2.. .

Seedlings were grown for 7d in CD or CL on MS agar supplemented with 50muM MeJA or 4muM ACC. At least 15 seeds were sown per genotype. The germination ratio is shown as a percentage (%).. . . . . . COI1 is not required for ACC-induced root hair elongation or gene expression. Exogenous ethylene or ACC increases the number and length of root hairs in Arabidopsis, in the light and in the dark (Tanimoto et al., 1995). Tests were conducted to determine whether this response required COI1. ACC induced root hair elongation in both wild-type and coi1-16 seedlings in the light and in the dark (Fig. 3B, data not shown). In contrast, etr1-1 and etr1-1;coi1-16 seedlings showed no visible root hair elongation in the presence or absence of ACC (Fig. 3B). The ethylene-insensitive mutants listed in Table 1 were germinated in the light and in the dark on MS and on ACC. All had shorter root hairs compared with the wild-type, except ein4, as previously reported (Cho and Cosgrove, 2002) (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light requires both the COI1 and ETR1 pathways, whereas ACC-induced root hair elongation requires the ETR1 pathway but not the COI1 pathway.. Expression of ethylene-responsive genes was also investigated in coi1-16. Genes that are induced by ethylene but not differentially regulated by JAs were selected according to a previous report (Hua et al., 1998) and Genevestigator (Hruz et al., 2008). Seedlings were grown in the light on MS and on ACC for 7d, and expression of ETR2 and ERS2 was determined by qRT-PCR. In the wild-type, ETR2 and ERS2 were induced >2-fold by ACC (Fig. 4). In coi1-16, induction was marginally less compared with that of the wild-type (Fig. 4); however, the difference was not statistically significant, indicating that COI1 is not required for ACC-induced expression of ETR2 and ERS2.. . Fig. 4.. . Ethylene-responsive gene expression in the wild-type and coi1-16. Seedlings were grown for 7d in continuous light (CL) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar supplemented or not with 4muM ACC. Ten to 15 seedlings were harvested per sample and three biological replicates were tested for gene expression of ETR2 and ERS2. The average expression ratios of ACC-treated samples to controls are expressed in a log2 scale. Bars indicate the standard error (SE).. . . . . . Involvement of other ethylene perception-response components in ACC-induced, light-dependent root growth inhibition. To identify other ethylene perception-response genes involved in ACC-induced, light-dependent, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition, a range of mutants was tested for light-induced response to ACC (Table 1). The reasoning behind this was that if the mutations defined genes that were in the signalling pathway for ACC-induced, light-dependent, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition, then the mutant plants would show less response to ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light than in the dark; that is, their phenotype would be similar in this respect to that of the coi1-16 mutant. The ethylene receptor mutants, ers1-1, ers2-1, etr2-1, and ein4 were less responsive to ACC than the wild-type, both in the light and in the dark, and were less responsive to ACC in the dark than in the light, similar to etr1-1. The constitutive ethylene response mutant ctr1-1 was partially responsive to ACC in the dark and in the light. ein2-1 and ein3-1 were less responsive to ACC than the wild-type in the light and in the dark, and were less responsive to ACC in the dark than in the light. A transgenic line overexpressing ERF1, 35S::ERF1, showed a slightly enhanced response to ACC to a similar extent in the light and in the dark, suggesting the existence of a positive feedback of this pathway. These results suggest that ERF1 could be required for both ACC-induced COI1-mediated and ETR1-mediated root growth inhibition pathways, whereas ETR2, EIN4, ERS1, ERS2, EIN2, EIN3, and possibly CTR1 are on the same pathway as ETR1.. Results in Fig. 3A show that the etr1-1;coi1-16 double mutant was less responsive to ACC-induced root growth inhibition than the single mutants. The double mutants ers1-1;coi1-16, ers2-1;coi1-16, ein2-1;coi1-16, and ein3-1;coi1-16 also showed less response than the single parental mutants to ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light (Table 1). These results indicate that COI1 functions additively with the known ethylene signalling pathway in ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light. The double mutant ctr1-1;coi1-16 was severely stunted and infertile.. . . ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition is independent of individual photoreceptors, but dependent on photoperiods. The results indicate that ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition requires light. To investigate whether the known photoreceptors were required, photoreceptor mutants were tested for ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light. These included the far-red/red light receptor mutants, phytochromeA (phyA) and phyB, and the UV-A/blue light receptor mutants, cryptochrome1 (cry1), cry2, phototropin1 (phot1) and phot2, the double mutants cry1;cry2 and phot1;phot2, and the quadruple mutant cry1;cry2;phot1;phot2. All of the tested mutants showed a wild-type response to ACC in the light (data not shown).. These results indicate that none of the known photoreceptors appears to be individually required for ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition. Therefore, the effect of different photoperiods, including CD, short day (SD, 8/16h light/dark), long day (LD, 16/8h light/dark) and CL, on ACC-induced root growth inhibition of the wild-type and coi1-16 was examined (Table 3). coi1-16 showed significantly less response (P <0.001) to ACC than the wild-type in CL and LD (Table 3). coi1-16 was significantly less responsive than the wild-type to MeJA-induced root growth inhibition in all light conditions, and a tendency for a greater response to MeJA in the longer photoperiods was suggested (Table 3).. .

Root lengths of treated seedlings compared with that of control seedlings are expressed as the mean of relative root growth SE (%, n 12).. . . . . . MeJA and ACC inhibit root cell elongation. MeJA and ACC inhibit root growth in light-grown seedlings, wholly or partially through COI1. To investigate whether this was through reducing cell elongation or reducing cell division, seedlings were grown for 7d in the light on MS agar containing each inhibitor, and the lengths of mature root epidermal cells were measured under a brightfield microscope. Treatment of wild-type seedlings with MeJA reduced mature cell length and root length to 46.7% and 26.3% of those of controls, respectively (Table 4). Therefore, the reduction in cell length could account for 72% of the observed reduction in root length. In contrast, treatment of coi1-16 seedlings with MeJA reduced mature cell length only to 92.1% of that of controls, although root length was reduced to 79.1%. This means that the reduction in cell length could only account for 38% of the observed reduction in root length, indicating that COI1 plays a major role in the MeJA-induced inhibition of cell elongation. Treatment of wild-type seedlings with ACC reduced cell length and root length to 48.0% and 56.2% of those of controls, respectively, and treatment of coi1-16 seedlings with ACC reduced cell length and root length to 90.7% and 76.5%, respectively (Table 4). Therefore, reduction in cell length could account for most if not all of the observed reduction in root length in the wild-type and 40% of the observed reduction in root length in coi1-16.. .

Standard error (SE) is shown for the value of cell length and cell elongation.. . . . . . ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition does not require SCF complex assembly but requires the LRR domain of COI1. The previous section described the possibility of different mechanisms by which MeJA- and ACC-induced COI1-mediated root growth inhibition might be regulated. To investigate this point further, the coi1-16 mutant was examined after various COI1 constructs had been introduced. The plants carrying the F-box or LRR region of COI1 and the COI1 gene with a substitution at Trp44 to alanine (W44), all fused to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in the Col background (Devoto et al., 2002), were crossed to coi1-16. The F3 lines that were confirmed to be homozygous for coi1-16 with each transgene expressed were used for the analyses. The parental transgenic lines F-box, LRR and W44 showed a wild-type response to MeJA and ACC in the light and in the dark (Fig. 5). The transgenic lines in the coi1-16 background (coi1-16;F-box, coi1-16;LRR, and coi1-16;W44) showed a statistical difference compared with the wild-type in response to MeJA, indicating that none of these transgenes is sufficient to complement completely the reduced response of coi1-16 to MeJA. In contrast, in response to ACC in the light, coi1-16;F-box showed a coi1-16-like response, and coi1-16;LRR and coi1-16;W44 showed a wild-type response, indicating that transgenes encoding the intact LRR domain are sufficient to complement the reduced response of coi1-16 to ACC in the light. Interestingly, the W44 transgene partially restored infertility of the coi1-1 null mutant, but not the F-box or LRR transgenes.. . Fig. 5.. . Complementation of coi1-16 with various COI1 constructs.
