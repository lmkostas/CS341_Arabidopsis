Results. . Curation of the Arabidopsis RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase protein sequences. To re-confirm the published RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase proteins encoded in Arabidopsis genome the 27,667 Arabidopsis proteins from the latest genome annotation release (ARA11) were scanned for RING domains. Through filtering the signatures in Gene3D, SUPERFAMILY, ProSiteProfiles, SMART, Pfam, ProSitePatterns altogether 509 putative RING domain containing protein sequences were obtained (Supplemental Table 2). RING gene names and descriptions were obtained from Araport using Thalemine tool (Supplemental Table 2). Araport used curated but also automatic gene annotation, therefore many RING domain containing proteins were annotated as RING/U-box protein although they did not contain U-box domain. Similarly, some were annotated as RING/FYVE/PHD zinc finger superfamily proteins. The 509 RING sequences were compared to the previously described RING-type protein sequences (Kosarev et al., 2002; Stone et al., 2005). From the 509 identified RING domain proteins 457 matched with the 490 previously described, thus resulting in 31 non-matching sequences (Figure 2). These non-matching sequences were thoroughly analyzed and, 6 of them were found to be merged with other gene models, 10 had no RING domain, 3 were not found in the database, 3 corresponded to pseudogenes, 7 were split and a new locus identifier had been assigned for them, and 2 were transposable elements (Supplemental Table 3A). The 50 additionally identified RING domain proteins were shown to represent diverse RING domains such as, 1 of D type, 4 of C2 type, 20 of H2, 16 of HC, 2 of S/T, and 7 of V (CH) type, according to the Stone et al. (2005) classification (Supplemental Table 2).. . Figure 2. . RING gene family of 509 as identified by: this study (Kosarev et al., 2002; Stone et al., 2005). This study brought in 50 new RING genes and 31 from the earlier studies were excluded.. . . . . . Differential gene expression data identifies 122 flower related RING ubiquitin E3 ligases. To associate the RING domain proteins with flowering or flower development two approaches were followed: (1) identifying those with gene expression enhanced or enriched during flower development or in flower organs, and (2) by searching RING proteins interacting with known flower regulators. For the first approach Genevestigator (Hruz et al., 2008) tool was used to rank differentially expressed genes (DEG) of the identified RING genes over Arabidopsis developmental stages and in flower organs relative to their expression in developed rosette (Figures 3A,B). In the selected experiments in Genevestigator database, probes were available for 393 of the 509 RING E3 ligases analyzed. The cut off for DEGs was set at 2-fold to be included in the selection resulting in lists of genes of interest for each of the categories. This process was repeated to identify gene expression enrichment at each of the development stages of bolting, young flower, developed flower, and flower and siliques. For the developmental categories altogether 71 DEGs were identified (Figure 3C). In addition to the developmental stages, enrichment for shoot apical meristem, sepal, petal, stamen and pistil organs were retrieved and resulted in 109 DEGs (Figure 3D). Some of the RING genes were common between these two categories and in total 122 unique RING genes were up-regulated in the flower related processes. The gene identifying AGI codes of these 122 flower related candidates are provided in the Supplemental Table 3B.. . Figure 3. .

For the second approach we identified 6 additional genes of interest through literature study and from interaction networks of CO, COP1, and TOE2 from BioGRID (http://thebiogrid.org/). Based on these interaction screens 5 RING E3 ligases were selected to the study, represented by the following mutant lines; N656705 (AT5G65683), N686069 (AT1G61620), N372291 (AT3G29270), N2037522 and N67002 (AT4G17680), and N742646 (AT2G44410). In addition, a mutant line for COP1, cop1-6, and RED AND FAR-RED INSENSITIVE 2 (RFI2) for which a role in mediating red and far-red light signaling and ubiquitination activity has been shown in vitro, were included (Stone et al., 2005; Chen and Ni, 2006a). This E3 ligase was selected as a candidate since its expression is regulated by circadian clock and rfi2-1 mutant flowers early (Chen and Ni, 2006b). Thus, one mutant allele for RFI2 (N878610) was included in the study. Mutants representing these genes were analyzed together with the flower up-regulated RINGs and were named flower related UPS candidates in the Supplemental Table 1.. . . Representative mutant collection. For functional characterization of the 122 flower related UPS candidates and those selected based on literature, a mutant collection was obtained from the NASC stock center. The mutants represented lines from CATMA, SAIL, SALK, and GABI-Kat collections (Alonso et al., 2003; Rosso et al., 2003; Schmid et al., 2005; Kleinboelting et al., 2012). Altogether 43 lines were shown to contain T-DNA insertion in one locus, six were doubtful and were omitted from the analysis. To confirm that the T-DNA insertion had interrupted the gene of interest, their altered expression levels were confirmed by qPCR analysis with primers listed in Supplemental Table 1. For 43 accessions representing 30 unique loci from the 122 flower related UPS candidates and the selected candidates a differential gene expression pattern was analyzed. Altogether 19 lines were knock-outs, and 13 knock-down mutants, and for 10 lines up-regulation of the gene of interested was observed (Supplemental Table 1). For one line, no differential expression was confirmed and this was excluded from the phenotyping. For 14 lines alleles were available with similar or opposite gene expression patterns.. . . Phenotypic screen of the mutant accessions. From the genotypically and qPCR confirmed T-DNA insertion mutant lines, 43 were subjected to phenotypic characterization by top view RGB imaging using the PlantScreen system. Image series of each analyzed line were collected daily allowing analyzing the growth and changes in morphology over time. For scoring those lines showing phenotypes, we fitted general additive models (GAM) to each parameter of each analyzed lines (data not shown). Most of the lines showed no differences to their corresponding Col-0 controls. However, three lines were consistently different across the experiments compared to Col-0 in both growth and rosette morphology: csu1-4 (cop1 suppressor 1-4, N686069), sinal7-2 (seven in absentia like 7-2, N833574) (Peralta et al., 2016) and rha1a-1 (ring-h2 finger a1a-1, N2045046) (Table 1, Supplemental Tables 1, 4). The csu1-4 mutant rosette was clearly smaller than Col-0 and showed a yellowish coloration (Figure 4). The mutant line rha1a-1 seemed to have smaller leaves than Col-0, however, at the end of growth it appeared to have more leaves that resulted in similar final rosette area as compared to Col-0. This line also had shorter petioles and leaf serration. The third line sinal7-2 rosette was clearly larger than Col-0 but did not show major differences in color, shape or number of leaves (Figure 4).. . Table 1. .

Representative rosette images are shown from days 10 to 20 after stratification. DAS, days after stratification.. . . . To further analyze these three lines, mixed non-linear models were fitted to their data using several order polynomials for parametric analysis of the models. This analysis confirmed the earlier observations of significant changes in growth and development for these lines over time (Table 1). Line csu1-4 showed slower growth, reduced rosette area and perimeter compared to Col-0 along the complete measured period (Figures 5A,D). For line rha1a-1 the rosette area was very similar to Col-0 being, however, slightly but significantly larger over time probably due to its higher number of leaves (Figure 5B, Table 1). Although the differences between rha1a-1 and Col-0 were small the statistical model was able to capture those. Conversely, sinal7-2 showed both area and perimeter larger than Col-0 indicating more vigorous growth (Figures 5C,F).. . Figure 5. . Growth measurements from day 10 to 20.

DAS, days after stratification.. . . . . . Circularity parameters. Morphological data for parameters of circularity that include roundness, roundness 2 and isotropy were also evaluated for these lines (Figure 1). Line csu1-4 showed increased roundness over the total period analyzed in comparison to Col-0 (Figures 6A-C, Table 1). However, csu1-4 roundness curve had similar pattern to Col-0 but shifted to the right (Figure 6A). Similar situation was observed for sinal7-2, where the roundness curve shape was almost identical to Col-0 but in this case was shifted to the left, showing lower roundness along the total time period (Figure 6C, Table 1). Roundness curve of rha1a-1 was neither shifted nor similar to Col-0 curve. This line showed a lower roundness than Col-0 at the beginning of the analysis, reaching a stabilization point around 16 DAS (Table 1). For Col-0 plants roundness continued decreasing until it become lower than rha1a-1 (Figure 6B).. . Figure 6. . Circularity measurements from day 10 to 20.

DAS, days after stratification.. . . . Line csu1-4 showed a similar roundness 2 pattern as Col-0 that is shifted to the right by approximately 2 days (Figures 6D-F). Line rha1a-1, showed an oscillating pattern too, however, its roundness 2 values were constantly close to 0.9 with less steep peaks than Col-0, presenting the highest differences between days 12 and 16 (Figure 6E, Table 1). Similarly, to line csu1-4, line sinal7-2 presented an oscillating pattern very similar to Col-0, however, this time the curve had shifted to the left by approximately 1 day (Figure 6F).. Isotropy showed similar results as roundness and roundness 2, where line csu1-4 and sinal7-2 had similar oscillating pattern as Col-0, but csu1-4 curve is shifted to the right, while the curve for sinal7-2 is shifted to the left (Figures 6G-I). Line rha1a-1 showed a constant high isotropy value decreasing over time until reaching Col-0 pattern by day 23 (Figure 6H, Table 1).. . . Symmetry parameters. The morphological parameters describing symmetry were eccentricity and rotational mass symmetry (RMS) (Figure 1). For eccentricity, line csu1-4 showed a similar pattern as Col-0 plants with a large and a small eccentricity peak, but shifted to the right (Figure 7A). Line rha1a-1 presented no shift in its curve, but it showed a rather flat peak around days 11 and 15, remaining lower than Col-0 until the end of the analysis (Figure 7B, Table 1). This result shows that rha1a-1 is less eccentric than Col-0 along the complete analysis. Line sinal7-2 showed also a similar pattern to Col-0 plants with two eccentric peaks, but slightly shifted to the left (Figure 7C). For RMS line csu1-4 showed similar pattern as Col-0 plants, but shifted again to the right about 1 day for the highest peak and remained higher than Col-0 in the last days of the analysis (Figure 7D). On the other hand, rha1a-1 presented no shift in its curve, but it showed a decrease in the peak around days 11 and 15, decaying faster and remaining lower than Col-0 plants (Figure 7E, Table 1). Like in eccentricity, sinal7-2 was almost indistinguishable from the Col-0 plants, except for a slight shift to the left captured by the model (Figure 7F).. . Figure 7. .

DAS, days after stratification.. . . . . . Center distance parameters. The last two morphological parameters analyzed were compactness and slenderness of the leaves (SOL), which were based on the center distance (Figure 1). Here line csu1-4 showed a decay of compactness overtime in a similar way to Col-0 plants, but its curve was shifted to the right (Figure 8A). Lines csu1-4 and sinal7-2 presented quite normal compactness curves, while for rha1a-1 the pattern that was less compact than Col-0 plants at the beginning of the analyzed period (Figure 8B, Table 1). The compactness later rises above Col-0, showing higher compactness values. Like for the previously described parameters, sinal7-2 compactness curve showed slightly lower values than Col-0, except for the last 2 days where Col-0 plants reached sinal7-2 compactness (Figure 8C).. .

DAS, days after stratification.. . . . Line csu1-4 showed lower SOL values than Col-0, while rha1a-1 and sinal7-2 showed higher SOL values than Col-0 (Figures 8E,F, Table 1). The main differences in SOL could be observed during the exponential growing phase of the rosette and reaching a plateau at the end of the analyzed period where the differences to Col-0 plants become insignificant (Figures 8D-F).. . . Flowering time phenotypes. Flowering time mutants identified in the screen represented both with reduced and increased leaf numbers at bolting (Table 2). Line csu1-4 (AT1G61620) was clearly early-flowering in both experimental replications. AT5G63970, a putative forkhead box protein, mutant line was early flowering in one of two experimental replications. SBP (S-ribonuclease binding protein) family protein (AT4G17680) was late flowering in both experimental replications. As already shown by others, cop1-6 mutant was early flowering in both LAB (7) and DTB (22). In most of the mutant lines, LAB did not differ from Col-0 in all experimental replications, but the trend was observed in both or all. LAB or DTB of sinal7-2 did not differ from Col-0 in either of the experimental replications.. . Table 2. .

Mutation in SINAL7 causes flower growth phenotypes. Flower morphology of the analyzed mutants was observed under stereomicroscope. The mutant line sinal7-2 was found to produce flower buds of abnormal shape, characterized by presence of cavities in the bud tips (Figures 9A,B). These openings were present at one or both sides of the affected buds and were caused by tips of the lateral sepals bending inwards (Figures 9E,F). Also medial sepals frequently showed altered morphology: their tips covered the buds to a lesser extent than in Columbia, resulting in their blunt appearance. Whereas these phenotypes were present in all 18 analyzed inflorescences of sinal7-2 plants, regardless of the plant age-only two out of 13 analyzed wild type inflorescences showed similar sepal features, restricted to the first six flowers on the main stems. Scoring flowers stage late 12-15 (located between positions 1st and 20th on the main inflorescences) revealed that in 54% of the mutant flowers (43/80) at least one lateral sepal tip was bent inwards-as compared to 6/50, i.e., 12% in Col-0 (the analyzed flowers came from 13 to 9 individual plants, respectively).. .

Dissecting flower buds at the end of stage 12 revealed that the occurrence of ingrown lateral sepal tips was accompanied by petal wrinkling, as the sepal shape interfered with elongation of the petals (Figures 9G,H). Indeed, in some of the mature flowers with bent lateral sepal tips, the petal blades remained wrinkled; in several cases also pistil or stamen shape was affected (Figures 9C,D,I,J).. SINAL7 has been shown to mediate ubiquitination of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GAPC1) enzyme in vitro and to affect its enzymatic activity and subcellular localization in Arabidopsis (Peralta et al., 2016). In plants lacking GAPC1 male sterility was observed (Rius et al., 2008). To investigate whether deficiency of SINAL7 impairs male fertility in the sinal7-2 mutant, pollen viability was inspected according to the modified Alexander method (Peterson et al., 2010). Anthers of 12 mutant and 11 Col-0 flowers in the developmental stages late 12 and 13 were stained (early and late flowers, originating from at least five individual plants per line). However, no difference between the mutant and Col-0 pollen was observed: anthers of both lines contained almost exclusively viable pollen grains (Figures 9K,L)..
