ResultsEstablishing a high-throughput genetic screen for mutants with improved tolerance to low sulphateTo meet the high-throughput criterion, the procedure must allow thousands of seeds to be screened on a single plate. It was found that, in order to suppress the wild-type seedling growth, it was necessary to set up a sulphur-free growth condition. Therefore, a sulphur-free medium was developed that contained no added sulphur, which is described in the Supplementary data at JXB online. On this medium, the wild-type seeds were able to germinate, the cotyledons were able to open but arrested at the cotyledon stage. Although occasionally one pair of true leaves emerged, further growth was stopped (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the mutants continued to grow. The emergence of two to three pairs of true leaves and a rapidly elongating primary roots were also evident in the mutants (Fig. 1A). These characteristics were used as visual selection markers for our mutant screen. In addition, up to 3500 seeds could be screened in a single 150 mm plate, rendering the screen high-throughput. Therefore, a simple high-throughput genetic selection on sulphur-free agarose medium was capable of screening for Arabidopsis mutants with alterations in their growth in a sulphur-limited environment.Fig. 1.Arabidopsis mutants with improved low-sulphur tolerance isolated with a high-throughput genetic screen. (A) Primary screen. Seeds from the activation-tagging library were germinated on sulphur-free medium as described in the Materials and methods. Three putative mutants in the image taken at day 12 post-germination show continued growth as evidenced by 2-3 pairs of true leaves and long roots in contrast to the rest of the seedlings with arrested growth on the plate. (B) Secondary screen of sue3. To confirm the phenotype of the mutants from the primary screen, a secondary screen was conducted as described in the Materials and methods. The wild-type (wt) and the mutant seeds (sue3) were sown on sulphur-free medium. Continued growth was evident for the mutant. The image was recorded when seedlings were 10 d old. (C) Secondary screen of sue4. To confirm the phenotype of the mutants from the primary screen, a secondary screen was conducted as described in Materials and methods. The wildtype (wt) and the mutant seeds (sue4) were sown on sulphur-free medium. Continued growth was evident for the mutant. The image was recorded when seedlings were 10 d old. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)Isolation of Arabidopsis mutants with improved tolerance to low sulphateTo facilitate the isolation of gain-of-function mutants with improved abiotic stress tolerance, an activation-tagging library of 55 000 independent lines was generated with the T-DNA mutagen pSKI015 as described by Weigel et al. (2000). This library was used for isolating mutants with improved tolerance to drought and salt (Gao and Xiang, 2008; Yu et al., 2008). A few low-nitrogen-tolerant Arabidopsis mutants were also isolated from this library (Yu et al., 2004).Using the above-established conditions, the whole activation-tagging library was screened. Approximately 15 000 seeds were screened from each pool. The primary screen resulted in the isolation of 55 putative mutants that were rescued and grown to maturity and their seeds harvested. All the mutants were subjected to a secondary screen to confirm their mutant phenotype as demonstrated in Fig. 1B and C. After the secondary screen, only three gain-of-function mutants were confirmed and designated as sueN (sulphate utilization efficiency, N being a numeric). All these mutants were able to continue to grow after the cotyledon stage on the sulphur-free medium and showed similar phenotypes with the emergence of two to three pairs of true leaves. As a result, the biomass of the mutants was significantly higher than that of the wild type. The mutants sue3 and sue4 were characterized further.The well-developed root system of sue3 and sue4Besides the continued growth of shoots on sulphur-free medium, the mutants also showed faster root elongation. To display the root phenotype better, the mutants were germinated and grown vertically as shown in Fig. 2. On MS medium containing 1.5 mM sulphate, both mutants showed similar growth of roots and shoots to that of the wild type (Fig. 2A, C). However, on the sulphur-free medium, both mutants displayed a phenotype of longer primary root length (Fig. 2B, D). The primary roots of the mutants elongated much faster than those of the wild type. At day 12 after sowing, the primary root length of the mutants was about twice that of the wild type (Fig. 2E, F). These results suggest that the root elongation of the mutants were more responsive to the low-sulphur condition.Fig. 2.Primary root elongation on MS and sulphur-free medium :wild type versus mutants. Seeds of the wild type and the mutant were germinated on the MS or sulphur-free medium and the plates were placed vertically. The image was recorded when seedlings were 12 d old. (A) The wild type (wt) versus sue3 on MS medium. (B) The wild type (wt) versus sue3 on sulphur-free medium. (C) Growth curves of primary roots. The primary root length was measured every 3 d for the wild type and sue3 grown on MS as in (A) (wt/MS versus sue3/MS) and sulphur-free medium as in (B) (wt/-S versus sue3/-S). Values represent the mean of >30 plants and error bars represent SEM. (D) The wild type (wt) versus sue4 on MS medium. (E) The wild type (wt) versus sue4 on sulphur-free medium. (F) Growth curves of primary roots. The primary root length was measured every 3 d for the wild type and sue4 grown on MS as in (A) (wt/MS versus sue4/MS) and sulphur-free medium as in (B) (wt/-S versus sue4/-S). Values represent the mean of >30 plants and error bars represent SEM. (G) Shoot weight to root length. The primary root length was measured as in (C) and (F), and the fresh weight of shoot was measured after 12 d. Values represent the mean of >30 plants and error bars represent SEM. **P <0.01, ***P <0.001. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)The sue3 and sue4 mutants had a more established primary root system than the wild type, which might contribute to the better growth of mutants on sulphur-free medium. Therefore, shoot weight to primary root length was measured. At day 12 after sowing, the ratio of shoot weight to primary root length of sue4 was about twice that of the wild type on the sulphur-free medium (Fig. 2G), while sue3 was about 50% higher than the wild type. On the normal medium no significant differences were observed between the mutants and the wild type (Fig. 2G).The mutant phenotype is specific for sulphur deficiency.To confirm whether the mutant phenotype is specific for sulphur deficiency, root elongation was examined on nitrogen-, phosphate-, and potassium-deficient medium. Figure 3 shows that the increased elongation rate of the primary roots in the mutants was specific for sulphur-deficiency. On the N-, P-, and K-deficient medium, root elongation of both wild type and mutants was greatly inhibited. However, under N-deficiency sue4 roots grew significantly longer than sue3 and the wild type. However, under P- and K-deficiency medium, the difference of primary root elongation was not statistically significant between the wild type and mutants. Both mutants showed a significantly faster root growth rate on the S-deficient medium, indicating that the root elongation of the mutants is a specific response to sulphur deficiency.Fig. 3.Mutant phenotype is specific for sulphate deficiency. The specificity to nutrient deficiency was assayed for the mutants on the medium with specific nutrient deficiency (N, nitrogen; P, phosphate; K, potassium; S, sulphur) as described in the Materials and methods. The seeds of the mutant sue3 and sue4 and the wild type (wt) were sown on the same plate, germinated vertically, and grown for 12 d before primary root length was measured. Values represent the mean of >30 plants and error bars represent SEM. *0.05< P <0.01, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)No growth difference under normal sulphur conditions between the mutants and the wild typeUnder normal sulphur conditions (750 muM sulphate on 1/2 MS), no obvious difference was observed between the mutants and the wild type throughout their life cycle (Fig. 4A, D). However, in low-sulphur hydroponic culture with 75 muM sulphate, flowering was delayed in sue4 compared with that in the wild type. The wild type and sue3 showed a bolting frequency of 70% while sue4 only 33% at the same time after growth in low-sulphur hydroponic culture for 4 weeks (Fig. 4E, F). No significant difference was observed between sue3 and the wild type. Both mutants did not show any significant difference in flowering timing in normal-sulphur hydroponic culture (liquid 1/2 MS medium) (Fig. 4F).Fig. 4.Growth behaviour of sue3, sue4, and the wild type under normal conditions and hydroponic culture. (A) 8-d-old seedlings grown on MS medium, sue3 versus wt (upper) and sue4 versus wt (lower). (B) 2-week-old plants grown in soil, sue3 versus wt (upper) and sue4 versus wt (lower). (C) 4-week-old plants grown in soil, sue3 versus wt (upper) and sue4 versus wt (lower). (D) 7-week-old plants grown in soil, sue3 versus wt (upper) and sue4 versus wt (lower). (E) After 3 weeks grown in hydroponics system with sulphate concentration of 75 muM, the wild type and the sue3 began to bolt, while sue4 was delayed. (F) Bolting frequency under low sulphur stress. The wild type (wt) and sue4 seeds were sown on 1/2 MS medium (750 muM sulphate) and low sulphur medium (75 muM sulphate) for 7 d, and the contents in the low sulphur medium is the same as in the 1/2 MS medium except the sulphur concentration. Then seedlings were translated in hydroponics system containing 1/2 MS medium and low sulphur medium for 3 weeks. Values represent the mean of >20 seedlings. Error bars represent SEM. *0.05< P <0.01, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)The mutants show improved tolerance to heavy metal and oxidative stressThe sulphur nutrient level is directly linked to heavy metal and oxidative stress tolerance (Noctor and Foyer, 1998). To find out whether the mutant has improved tolerance to heavy metal and oxidative stress, they were assayed for growth on 1/2 MS medium supplemented with heavy metal CdCl2 or paraquat. The results in Fig. 5A show that the mutants had significantly higher germination frequency in the presence of various concentrations of CdCl2. Within the range of CdCl2 concentrations tested, the higher the CdCl2 concentration the greater the difference between the wild type and the mutant. At 100 muM CdCl2, the mutant showed a germination frequency of more than 60% while wild-type control only 20%. This suggests that the tolerance to heavy metal stress was significantly improved in the sue3 and sue4 mutants.Fig. 5.Improved tolerance of the mutants to heavy metal and oxidative stress. (A) Germination frequency under heavy metal stress. The wild type (wt) and mutant (sue3 and sue4) seeds were sown on 1/2 MS medium (750 muM sulphate) containing heavy metal CdCl2 of indicated concentrations. For each treatment, 25 seeds of each mutant and the wild type were sown on the same plate. Four replica plates were used. Germination frequency was scored 12 d after sowing. Values represent the mean of >100 seeds and error bars represent SEM. *P <0.01, **P <0.001. (B) Germination frequency under oxidative stress. The wild-type and mutant seeds were germinated on 1/2 MS medium supplemented with paraquat of indicated concentrations. For each treatment, 25 seeds of each mutant and the wild type were sown on the same plate and four replica plates were used. Germination frequencies were scored 12 d after sowing. Values represent the mean of 100 plants and error bars represent SEM. *P <0.01, **P <0.001.The germination frequency under oxidative stress was assayed by germinating seeds on the 1/2 MS medium containing 0, 1, 2, and 3 muM paraquat. The results in Fig. 5B show that wild-type seedlings were more rapidly bleached and their germination frequency decreased as paraquat concentration increased in the medium. By contrast, the germination frequency of both mutants was still above 70% under the same conditions. These results indicate that the tolerance of the mutants to oxidative stress was significantly improved compared with the wild type.Sulphate uptake, non-protein thiols, total sulphur, and free sulphate content in the mutants versus the wild typeConsidering that sulphate uptake may be one of the major determinants of sulphate utilization efficiency, sulphate uptake experiments were conducted as described in the Materials and methods using Na235SO4. The kinetics of sulphur uptake are shown in Fig. 6. The results of dose-dependent sulphate uptake experiments (with different sulphate concentrations) in Fig. 6A indicate that the mutants had the same Vmax values as the wild type, and the results of time-dependent sulphate uptake experiments in Fig. 6B indicate that the mutant sue3 had a significantly higher rate of sulphate uptake than the wild type at low sulphate levels (10 muM) while sue4 had a rate similar to the wild type.Fig. 6.Kinetics of sulphate uptake. (A) Dose-dependent sulphur uptake. Na235SO4 uptake experiments were conducted in medium with the indicated concentration of sulphate, and every medium contented 10 muM Na235SO4. Uptake was allowed for 6 h before samples were prepared for scintillation counting as described in the Materials and methods. Values represent the mean of three experiments and error bars represent SEM. (B) Time-dependent sulphur uptake. Sulphate uptake experiments were conducted in sulphur-free medium supplemented with 10 muM Na235SO4. Uptake was allowed for the time indicated before samples were prepared for scintillation counting as described in the Materials and methods. Values represent the mean of three experiments and error bars represent SEM.To determine whether sulphate metabolism is changed in the sue mutants, the non-protein thiols cysteine and GSH were quantified using HPLC as described by Xiang and Oliver (1998) as well as free sulphate and total sulphur content as described by Kolthoff (1969) for the mutants and the wild-type plants. Figure 7A and B show that under normal sulphur conditions, the GSH content was significantly higher in sue mutants than in the wild type. After being shifted to sulphur-free medium for 48 h, the GSH content was significantly higher in sue4 while that in sue3 was significantly lower than the wild type. The cysteine content showed a similar result to GSH except under normal conditions when no difference was observed between sue4 and the wild type.Fig. 7.Non-protein thiols, total sulphur, and free sulphate content in the mutants versus the wild type. (A, B) 7-d-old sue4 and the wild type were transplanted from MS hydroponic medium (Normal) to sulphate-free hydroponic medium (Sulphur-free) for 48 h before tissue extracts were prepared for quantification of GSH and cysteine. Three replicate experiments were conducted for each treatment. Error bars represent SEM. *0.05<P <0.01, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001. (C) Total sulphur content of seedlings and seeds. Seeds of the wild type and the mutants were germinated on the MS or low-sulphur medium (75 muM sulphate) for 4 d, then transplanted into MS medium (Normal) or sulphur-free medium (Sulphur-free) for 10 d before quantifying total sulphur content. Air-dry wild-type and mutant seeds were directly quantified for total sulphur content (Seed). For each treatment, three replica experiments were used and error bars represent SEM. *0.05<P <0.01, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001. (D) Free sulphate content. Seeds of the wild type and the mutants were germinated on the MS or low-sulphur medium (75 muM sulphate) for 7 d, respectively. MS medium-germinated seedlings were transferred to soil and grew for 42 d before free sulphate quantification (Normal). Low-sulphur medium-germinated seedlings were transferred to sulphur-free hydroponic medium and grew for 42 d before free sulphate quantification (Sulphur-free). For each treatment, three replica experiments were used and error bars represent SEM. *0.05< P < 0.01, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001.Figure 7C shows that total sulphur after acid hydrolysis was not significantly different between sue4 and the wild type under both normal conditions and after sulphur-free stress. However, sue3 had a significantly higher total sulphur content than the wild type under normal conditions while after sulphur-free stress total sulphur content in the sue3 dropped to the level in the wild type. Total sulphur content in seeds of sue3 was significantly higher than that of the wild type and sue4 while no difference was observed between sue4 and the wild type.Free sulphate content was not significantly different between the mutants and the wild type (Fig. 7D) under either normal sulphur conditions (soil-grown) or sulphur-free stress (hydroponic culture). As expected, the free sulphate level was greatly reduced for all under the sulphur-free stress compared with that under normal conditions. This is also true for non-protein thiols and total sulphur except for the cysteine level in sue4 under sulphur-free conditions which was similar to that under normal conditions.Genetic analysis of sue3 and sue4To reveal the nature of the mutations in both mutants, crosses were made for genetic analysis. The wild type as female parent was crossed with the homozygous mutant as the pollen donor. F1 plants were selfed to obtain F2 seeds. Both F1 and F2 seeds were assayed for growth on the sulphur-free medium.For mutant sue3, all 24 F1 seeds were sensitive to low sulphur levels. Among the F2 seeds that resulted from F1 selfing, 59 seeds were low-sulphur-tolerant and 161 were low-sulphur-sensitive. A chi square analysis showed that this did not deviate significantly from a 1:3 (tolerant to sensitive) segregation ratio (chi2=0.388, P >0.1). These results indicate that the sue3 mutant was caused by a single recessive nuclear locus. The recessive nature of the mutation implies that the tagged gene was probably disrupted by the T-DNA insertion.For the mutant sue4, 360 F1 seeds were low-sulphur-tolerant and 19 were low-sulphur-sensitive. The segregation was close to the expected 379 to 0 ratio (chi2=0.953, P >0.1). The 19 sensitive seeds might result from non-viable seeds. Among the F2 seeds that resulted from F1 selfing, 140 seeds were low-sulphur-tolerant and 49 were low-sulphur-sensitive. A chi square analysis showed that this did not deviate significantly from a 3:1 (tolerant to sensitive) segregation ratio (chi2=0.492, P >0.1). These results indicate that the sue4 mutant was caused by a single dominant locus. Moreover, the mutant phenotype co-segregated with herbicide resistance (data not shown). The dominance of the mutation suggests that the tagged gene is activated by the enhancers on the T-DNA.Identification of T-DNA tagged loci in the mutantsBy using TAIL-PCR (Liu et al., 1995), the T-DNA insertion junction of sue3 was amplified and sequenced, three copies of T-DNA were identified, one was inserted around 382 bp upstream of the ATG codon of At5g62200, the other two copies were inserted at the same location in inverted repeats in the second intron of the At1g43700 (see Supplementary Fig. 1A at JXB online). RT-PCR analysis indicated that there were no significant changes of transcript level of At5g62200 and At5g62210 between the wild type and sue3 (see Supplementary Fig. 1B at JXB online), indicating that the T-DNA insertion did not affect the expression of these two genes. However, At1g43700 was completely disrupted (Fig. 8), consistent with the genetic analysis results. The full length of At1g43700 is 2011 bp, with four exons and three introns (Fig. 8A). At1g43700 is the previously identified VirE2-interacting Protein1 (VIP1), which mediates nuclear translocation of VirE2 (Tzfira et al., 2001; Li et al., 2005).Fig. 8.Multiple mutant allele analysis of low sulphur tolerance for the At1g43700 locus. (A) Illustration of At1g43700 gene structure and location of T-DNA insertions. The arrows indicate the positions of the T-DNA insertions within the sue3 and Salk_001014 (Col-0 background). At1g43700 are represented by exons (red rectangles) and introns (black lines). (B) Confirmation of the knockout of At1g43700 in Salk_001014 (salk) and sue3 by RT-PCR. Tubulin was used as loading control. (C) Primary root length of Salk_001014 versus wt. For each treatment, 10 seeds of each line were vertically germinated and grown on the same normal sulphate (Normal) or sulphur-free (Sulphur-free) medium for 12 d before primary root length was measured. Three replicate plates were used and error bars represent SEM. *0.05< P <0.01, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001. (D) A typical result of root elongation experiment in (C), showing wild-type seedlings (wt) and Salk_001014 vertically grown on normal and sulphur-free medium for 12 d. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)In sue4, two copies of T-DNA were also detected by Southern blot and identified via TAIL-PCR and sequencing (data not shown). It was found that the two copies were inserted in inverted repeats at the same position that is 1758 bp from the stop codon of At3g55870 and 930 bp from the ATG codon of At3g55880. The At3g55880 locus comprises four exons and three introns (Fig. 9A) and is predicted to encode an unknown small membrane protein with four membrane-spanning domains. Based on the dominance nature of the mutation from our genetic analysis, the results of real-time RT-PCR analysis in Fig. 9B and C indicated that At3g55880 was activated while its neighbouring genes At3g55870 and At3g55890 were not. In the wild type, At3g55880 is expressed at low levels in seedling and rosette leaves, roots, and inflorescence stems of mature plants. In sharp contrast, At3g55880 is constitutively expressed at high levels (Fig. 9E, F).Fig. 9.At3g55880 locus is activated in sue4 mutant. (A) Illustration of At3g55880 locus in sue4. Two copies of T-DNA were inserted in an inverted orientation at position 20597, 1758 bp downstream from the stop codon of At3g55870 and 930 bp upstream from the ATG codon of At3g55880. (B) RT-PCR analysis of transcript levels of the neighbouring genes. Transcript levels for At3g55870, At3g55880, and At3g55890 were compared in the wild type and the sue4 mutant. The experiment was repeated three times, and a typical result is presented. (C) Real-time RT-PCR analysis of transcript levels of the neighbouring genes. Using the same samples and primers as in (B), real-time RT-PCR was performed for 30 cycles. The relative transcript level was obtained as folds of the tubulin transcript level, which was used as the internal control. Values represent the mean of three experiments and error bars represent SEM. (D) RT-PCR analysis of the expression patterns of At3g55880 in the mutant and the wild type. RNA was isolated from seedlings (Sd), roots (R), rosette leaves (R-leaf), cauline leaves (C-leaf), inflorescence stem (St), flowers (Fl), and siliques (Si) of the wild type and sue4 plants, respectively. Tubulin was used as a loading control. The experiment was repeated three times, and a typical result is presented. (E) Real-time RT-PCR analysis of the expression patterns of At3g55880 in the mutant and the wild type. Using the same samples and primers as in (D), real-time RT-PCR was performed for 30 cycles. The relative transcript level was obtained as folds of the tubulin transcript level, which was used as the internal control. Values represent the mean of three experiments and error bars represent SEM.As the phenotype of sue mutants seems to be specific to sulphur deprivation, it is important to determine whether SUE3 and SUE4 are regulated by sulphur. The results of RT-PCR analysis indicate that neither At1g43700 nor At3g55880 was responsive to low-sulphur stress (see Supplementary Fig. 1D at JXB online).Multiple mutant allele analysis for low-sulphate tolerance of sue3To confirm the gene-to-trait relationship in sue3, one Salk T-DNA insertion line Salk_001014 was obtained. The position of the T-DNA insertion is shown in Fig. 8A. In order to analyse the low sulphate tolerance of Salk_001014, the homozygous lines were isolated first with genomic PCR as described by Alonso et al. (2003). The homozygous plants were identified (see Supplementary Fig. 1C at JXB online). The disruption of At1g43700 in sue3 and Salk_001014 was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. The results shown in Fig. 8B indicate that both sue3 and Salk_001014 had undetectable transcript levels of At1g43700.The homozygous mutant of Salk_001014 was subsequently assayed for low-sulphur-tolerance phenotypes. Figure 8C and D show the markedly elongated primary roots of the knockout mutant under sulphur-free conditions compared with that of the wild type, while no difference in root elongation was observed under normal sulphur conditions between the mutant and the wild type. These results confirm that loss-of-At1g43700 caused the low-sulphur-tolerance phenotype in sue3.Recapitulation of sue4 phenotype in the wild type by overexpressing the tagged gene At3G55880To confirm that the low-sulphur-tolerance phenotype was conferred by the activated expression of At3g55880, the cDNA of At3g55880 was cloned into the binary expression vector pCB2004 for generating transgenic plants. The cDNA was under the control of the 35S promoter. Homozygous lines (T2 generation) were confirmed for the transgene over-expression (Fig. 10A). Results of the low-sulphur tolerance assay experiments are shown in Fig. 10B and C. Under normal sulphur conditions (1/2 MS), there was no significant difference in root development between the pCB2004-SUE4 transgenic line, sue4, and the wild type. However, under sulphur-free conditions, the primary root of the transgenic line and sue4 was significantly longer than that of the wild type. This result confirms that over-expression of the At3g55880 confers the improved low-sulphur tolerance in sue4.Fig. 10.Recapitulation of sue4 phenotype in the wild type by overexpressing At3g55880 cDNA. (A) Illustration of the overexpression construct pCB2004-SUE4 and verification of the overexpression transgenic line (ox) via RT-PCR analysis. Tubulin was used as loading control. (B) Root elongation assay. The wild type (wt), sue4, and the ox seeds were vertically germinated and grown for 12 d on 1/2 MS medium and sulphur-free medium (-S) before primary root length was measured. (C) Primary root length after 12 d growth as in (B). Values represent the mean of >30 plants and error bars represent SEM. *0.05 < P <0.01, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)Constitutively overexpressing At3g55880 confers low-sulphur tolerance in transgenic tobaccoThe same pCB2004-SUE4 construct was transferred into tobacco. Three transgenic lines 4-6, 9-6, and 9-7 were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 11A) and assayed for low-sulphur tolerance. The transgenic lines displayed a more elongated primary root under sulphur-free conditions compared with the wild type (Fig. 11B, C). The representative line 9-7 is shown in Fig. 11B. The tolerance to oxidative and heavy metal stress was also improved in the transgenic lines compared with the wild type (Fig. 11D, E). These results with transgenic tobacco not only further confirm that activated expression of SUE4 causes the low-sulphur-tolerance phenotype, but also demonstrate the potential of this gene to improve low-sulphur-tolerance of crops.Fig. 11.Overexpression of SUE4 in tobacco recapitulates sue4-like phenotype. (A) Verification of overexpression transgenic lines in tobacco via RT-PCR analysis. Tubulin was used as loading control. (B) Root elongation assay. The pCB2004-SUE4 was used to generate transgenic tobacco plants. The overexpression line 4-6, 9-6, 9-7, and the wild type were assayed for primary root elongation on 1/2 MS medium (normal) and sulphur-free medium. Primary root length was measured at day 20 after sowing. (C) Primary root length after 20 d growth as in (A).
