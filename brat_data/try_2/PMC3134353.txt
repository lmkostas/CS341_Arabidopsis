Results. . YUCCA6 over-expression plants exhibit delayed leaf senescence. YUCCA6 (At5g25620) encodes a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) (Kim et al., 2007). It is one of 11 Arabidopsis thaliana YUCCA family members that have been reported to be involved in de novo auxin biosynthesis (Zhao et al., 2001). The dominant A. thaliana yuc6-1D activation mutant contains elevated levels of free IAA due to the over-expression of YUCCA6 and exhibits phenotypes which are typical in auxin-overproducing plants, for example, curled rosette leaves and long hypocotyls (Kim et al., 2007). The yuc6-1D mutant also has a dramatically delayed senescence phenotype. As shown in Fig. 1, yuc6-1D and 35S:YUC6 plants show a prolonged life span. Five-month-old mutants even produce new shoots and flowers (Fig. 1A, B). The loss of total chlorophyll content in yuc6-1D leaves during the natural senescence process is delayed compared with that in wild-type leaves (Fig. 1C).. . Fig. 1.. . YUCCA6 over-expression plants display the staygreen phenotype. Five-month-old yuc6-1D (A) and 35S:YUC6 plants (B) are shown along with their wild-type (WT) controls. New shoots and flowers produced from 5-month-old YUCCA6 over-expression lines are shown in the insets. (C) Total chlorophyll content of the 3rd and 4th rosette leaves of the wild type and yuc6-1D are compared. Data represent the mean SD (n=10-12).. . . . The role of auxin in senescence was investigated further by the classic, detached-leaf dark-induced senescence assay system (Miller and Huffaker, 1985; Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005). Fully grown third and fourth rosette leaves from the wild type and yuc6-1D and 35S:YUC6 transgenic plants were detached and incubated under dark conditions. Total chlorophyll degradation and the loss of photosystem II efficiency during the dark treatment were measured as senescence indicators (Kim et al., 2009). As shown in Fig. 2, loss of total chlorophyll content and photosystem II efficiency during dark-induced senescence was delayed in both yuc6-1D and 35S:YUC6 leaves compared with their isogenic wild-type controls. The transcript of SAG12 (At5g45890), a well-characterized senescence marker which encodes a cysteine protease, increases specifically during senescence (Nam, 1997; Noh and Amasino, 1999). The accumulation of the SAG12 transcript was found to be delayed in yuc6-1D and 35S:YUC6 leaves during dark-induced senescence compared with wild-type leaves (Fig. 2D, H). Together, these measurements show that over-expression of YUCCA6 delays dark-induced leaf senescence.. . Fig. 2.. . Over-expression of YUCCA6 is associated with a delay of dark-induced senescence in detached leaves. Third and fourth rosette leaves from 3.5-week-old wild type (WT), yuc6-1D, and 35S:YUC6 plants were detached and incubated in 3 mM MES buffer (pH 5.7) in the dark. (A, E) Leaves were photographed 4 d after incubation in the dark. (B, F) Total chlorophyll content of detached rosette leaves at different time points during dark incubation is shown. (C, G) Photosystem II efficiency (Fv/Fm) of dark incubated rosette leaves is depicted. The data in (B), (C), (F), and (G) represent the mean SD (n=12). (D, H) Shown are the mRNA levels of senescence associated gene 12 (SAG12) normalized to UBQ10 (At4g05320) mRNA levels over the dark-incubation period. mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR. Data represent the mean SD of three biological repeats. Asterisks indicate P <0.05 from Student's t test.. . . . . . Plants over-expressing mutated YUCCA6 do not exhibit delayed leaf senescence or phenotypes typical of auxin hyper-accumulation. Multiple sequence alignments of animal, yeast, and A. thaliana FMO genes revealed that YUCCA6 contains conserved binding sites for the cofactors NADPH and FAD. Previous reports have shown that Gly residues in these NADPH and FAD binding sites are required for cofactor binding and enzyme activity of FMOs from both A. thaliana and animals (Kubo et al., 1997; Bartsch et al., 2006). The conserved Gly residues in the NADPH binding motif of YUCCA6 were therefore changed to Ala (G204A) and Val (G206V) by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3A). Mutated YUCCA6 ORF under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter was transformed into wild-type plants and several single-insertion homozygous lines were identified. Among these homozygous lines, two transgenic lines over-expressing mutated YUCCA6 were chosen and named as mYUC6-16 and mYUC6-11. Both show enhanced YUCCA6 transcript expression levels similar to yuc6-1D plants and were used for further study (Fig. 3B).. . Fig. 3.. . Over-expression of mutated YUCCA6 does not result in delayed dark-induced leaf senescence. (A) NADPH binding motif and conserved amino acids in Arabidopsis YUCCA family members are shown. Mutated amino acids are marked with asterisks. Glycine-204 and glycine-206 were changed to alanine and valine, respectively. (B, C) Shown are transcript levels of YUCCA6 and IAA2 in leaves of 3.5-week-old wild-type plants untransformed (WT) or transformed with YUCCA6 having mutations in the NADPH binding site (35S:mYUC6-11 and 35S:mYUC6-16). Also shown for comparison are transcript levels of YUCCA6 and IAA2 in leaves of 3.5-week-old yuc6-1D mutant plants. Data represent the mean SD (n=3). (D) Shown are 4-week-old WT, yuc6-1D, 35S:mYUC6-11, and 35S:mYUC6-16 plants. (E) WT, 35S:mYUC6-16, and yuc6-1D leaves were detached and photographed 4 d after dark incubation. (F) Shown are total chlorophyll contents and photosynthesis efficiencies (Fv/Fm) of untreated leaves (Light) and 4-d dark treated (Dark) WT, 35S:mYUC6-16, and yuc6-1D leaves. Data represent the mean SD (n=8).. . . . One function of YUCCA6 is to produce free IAA by catalysing the rate-limiting step in tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Accordingly, the yuc6-1D mutant that over-expresses YUCCA6 has elevated free IAA levels. By extension, transgenic plants over-expresssing mYUC6 should have the same IAA contents as untransformed control plants because mYUC6 is expected to be catalytically inactive. A reflection of the elevated free IAA levels in the yuc6-1D mutant is the up-regulation of over 30 auxin-responsive genes, including members of the AUX/IAA family of IAA-induced proteins, and the small auxin up RNA (SAUR) family (Kim et al., 2007). The auxin-responsive gene IAA2 (At3g23030), that was identified as a highly up-regulated gene in yuc6-1D by microarray analysis (Kim et al., 2007), was therefore selected to indirectly compare auxin levels in leaves. As expected, expression of IAA2 was highly increased in yuc6-1D leaves but not in leaves of mYUC6-11 and mYUC6-16 (Fig. 3C). Another indicator of auxin over-accumulation is the morphological phenotype of narrow and downward curled rosette leaves. This narrow and curled rosette leaf phenotype is observed in Arabidopsis lines over-expressing YUCCA1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 (Zhao et al., 2001; Marsch-Martinez et al., 2002; Woodward et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Fig. 3D). However, mYUC6-11 and mYUC6-16 mutants did not display curled leaf morphology even though these mutants contain over-expressed mutated YUCCA6 (Fig. 3B, D). The wild-type level of auxin-inducible gene expression and no high-auxin morphological phenotype in mYUC6-11 and mYUC6-16 plants suggest that over-expression of mutated YUCCA6 could not elevate the auxin level. Dark-induced senescence was then tested with detached mYUC6-16 rosette leaves. The total chlorophyll content and photosystem II efficiency of mYUC6-16 and wild-type leaves that had been dark-treated for 4 d were comparable, whereas leaves of the yuc6-1D mutant retained more chlorophyll and greater photosystem II efficiency (Fig. 3E, F). These results suggest that the conserved NADPH binding site of FMOs that is required for catalytic activity is also required for YUCCA6 to function in auxin biosynthesis and delayed leaf senescence. This led to the hypothesis that the delayed leaf senescence phenotype of yuc6-1D is mediated by auxin.. . . Delay of dark-induced leaf senescence in yuc6-1D is mediated by auxin. To investigate whether elevated auxin levels in yuc6-1D actually result in a delayed senescence phenotype, A. thaliana 35S:iaaL transgenic plants that constitutively over-express IAA-lysine synthetase (iaaL) under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (Romano et al., 1991) were used. The iaaL gene encodes the Pseudomonas savastanoi IAA-lysine synthetase. In tobacco, constitutive overproduction of iaaL leads to a 20-fold reduction in free IAA with a concomitant increase in IAA-lysine resulting in morphological changes associated with auxin deprivation (Romano et al., 1991). The phenotype of transgenic Arabidopsis plants that express 35S:iaaL is also consistent with a reduction in free IAA (Jensen et al., 1998). Therefore yuc6-1D was crossed with a 35S:iaaL transgenic plant to eliminate the effects of excess auxin and phenotypes of the yuc6-1D parent and F1 progeny (35S:iaaLyuc6-1D) were compared. yuc6-1D plants exhibit long hypocotyls and increased expression of IAA2 due to elevated auxin levels in yuc6-1D (Fig. 4A-C). Hypocotyls of F1 progeny of the 35S:iaaLyuc6-1D plants failed to elongate as in yuc6-1D. Expression of the auxin-response gene IAA2 in 35S:iaaLyuc6-1D was not as high as in yuc6-1D (P <0.01) also indicating that over-expressing the iaaL gene in yuc6-1D plants reduces the effects of the elevated auxin level observed in yuc6-1D plants (Fig. 4C). Finally, a dark-induced senescence assay was performed with 35S:iaaLyuc6-1D F1 leaves. As shown in Fig. 4D, the loss of total chlorophyll content in 35S:iaaLyuc6-1D leaves during dark-induced senescence is not delayed as in yuc6-1D, while the loss of total chlorophyll content in 35S:iaaL during dark-induced senescence is more than in wild-type plants. This suggests that elevated free auxin levels in planta protect against leaf senescence.. . Fig. 4.. . The effects of excess auxin are eliminated in 35S:iaaL transgenic plants. (A) Eight-day-old wild-type (WT), yuc6-1D, 35S:iaaL, and 35S:iaaL X yuc6-1D seedlings are shown. (B) Shown are lengths of hypocotyls of 8-d-old seedlings of the indicated lines. Data represent the mean SD (n=10-12). (C) Depicted are the relative expression levels of the auxin response gene IAA2 in rosette leaves of 3.5-week-old plants that were measured by real-time PCR. UBQ10 was used for internal control. Data represent the mean SD (n=3). (D) Shown are per cent total chlorophyll contents during dark-induced senescence in detached leaves of 3.5-week-old WT, 35S:YUC6, 35S:iaaL, and 35S:iaaL X yuc6-1D leaves. The percentage total chlorophyll content was calculated from the ratio of the average of the chlorophyll content at the designated time to the average of the chlorophyll content at day zero (n=10-12).. . . . . . Auxin levels decrease during dark-induced senescence. Since auxin accumulation causes delayed senescence, it should follow that auxin levels decrease during dark-induced senescence. To test this hypothesis, free IAA levels were measured in dark-treated wild-type leaves and it was found that free IAA levels gradually decreased during dark-induced senescence (Fig. 5A). Transcript levels of the auxin-inducible gene, IAA2, decreased during dark-induced senescence in wild-type leaves, which is consistent with the observed decrease in free IAA content (Fig. 5A, B).. . Fig. 5.. . Auxin level decreases during dark-induced senescence. All measurements were made using detached 3rd and 4th rosette leaves of 3.5-week-old wild-type plants. The leaves were incubated in 3 mM MES buffer (pH 5.7) in the dark to induce senescence. (A) Shown are the free IAA levels in the leaves over the dark treatment. Twenty leaves from each time point were pooled for IAA measurement. Data shown are the means SD from three biological and technical repeats. (B) Shown are expression levels of the auxin response gene (IAA2) during dark-induced senescence. (C) Shown are expression levels of the auxin conjugating enzymes (GH3.1, GH3.3, GH3.5, and GH3.6) and the auxin biosynthesis genes (YUCCA1 and YUCCA6) during dark-induced senescence. Gene expression levels (B, C) were monitored by real-time PCR. UBQ10 was used for internal control. Data represent the mean SD from three biological and technical repeats.. . . . The free IAA pool is determined by multiple metabolic processes, which include de novo auxin biosynthesis, inactivation or storage of IAA by conjugation, and degradation of free IAA. Members of the GH3 family encode IAA-amino synthetases that function in the storage or inactivation of IAA by conjugation to amino acids (Staswick et al., 2005). As shown in Fig. 5C, the expression of GH3.1 (At2g14960), GH3.3 (At2g23170), GH3.5 (At4g27260), and GH3.6 (At5g54510) was gradually increased during dark-induced senescence, which is consistent with previous reports that also showed the increase of GH3.2 (At4g37390), GH3.5, and GH3.17 (At1g28130) transcripts during natural senescence and dark-induced senescence (Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005; van der Graaff et al., 2006). Considering that GH3 members are auxin-inducible genes, there appears to be a senescence-specific regulatory mechanism controlling GH3 transcript accumulation. Arabidopsis YUCCA family members, such as YUCCA1 and YUCCA6, function in de novo auxin biosynthesis (Zhao, 2008). Therefore, transcript levels of YUCCA1 (At1g21430) and YUCCA6 were measured and it was found that they were decreased during dark-induced senescence (Fig. 5C). Thus both increased expression of the GH3 family of auxin-conjugating enzymes and decreased expression of auxin biosynthesis components (exemplified by YUCCA1 and YUCCA6) contribute to the gradual reduction of free IAA levels during dark-induced senescence.. Plants over-expressing YUCCA1, similar to plants over-expressing YUCCA6, display phenotypes typical of plants with high levels of endogenous auxin indicating its involvement in auxin biosynthesis (Zhao et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2007). If it is really the free auxin level that determines the degree of senescence, it should follow that (i) over-expression of YUCCA1, that is down-regulated during senescence like YUCCA6, should result in delayed senescence and (ii) exogenous application of auxin to wild-type leaves should delay dark-induced senescence. To test this hypothesis, rosette leaves of yuc1-ox which is a YUCCA1 over-expression line were detached and incubated in the dark. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, yuc1-ox plants also showed delayed dark-induced senescence compared with the wild type. Furthermore, when the synthetic auxin alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) was exogenously applied to wild-type leaves, dark-induced senescence was delayed compared with mock-treated leaves (Fig. 6C, D). Considered together with data showing that 35S:iaaLyuc6-1D leaves tend to senesce at a rate similar to the wild type (Fig. 4D), these data support the hypothesis that elevated auxin delays dark-induced leaf senescence.. . Fig. 6.. . Over-expression of YUCCA1 and exogenous auxin treatment result in delayed dark-induced leaf senescence. All experiments were performed with detached 3rd and 4th rosette leaves of 3.5-week-old plants. (A) Shown are wild type (WT) and yuc1-ox detached leaves that were dark-treated for 4 d. (B) Chlorophyll contents from WT and yuc1-ox were measured at different time points during dark incubation. Data represent the mean SD (n=10-12). (C) Shown are detached WT leaves that were incubated in 3 mM MES buffer (pH 5.7) with DMSO or 20 muM NAA for 4 d under dark conditions. (D) Shown are total chlorophyll contents of detached WT leaves incubated as in (C) for 5 d. Data represent the mean SD (n=10). Asterisk indicates P <0.05 from Student's t test.. . . . It has been reported that mature rosette leaves of the yuc6-1D mutant have a higher auxin content than those of wild-type plants (Kim et al., 2007). Consequently, the free IAA content of detached yuc6-1D leaves, which also decreased during dark-induced senescence, remained proportionately higher than that of the wild type over the duration of the treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). The extent of senescence in detached leaves (Fig. 2A-D) was inversely correlated with intracellular auxin levels (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online).. . . YUCCA6 over-expression affects the expression of senescence-associated genes. Among hundreds of senescence-associated genes (SAGs), SAG12 expression is regulated in a senescence-specific mode. Specifically, SAG12 expression is limited to actively senescent tissues. SAG12 expression was down-regulated during dark-induced senescence by over-expression of YUCCA6 (Fig. 2D, H). It has been reported that application of auxin to wild-type Arabidopsis leaves during dark-induced senescence down-regulates the transcript level of SAG12 compared with mock-treated leaves (Noh and Amasino, 1999). Therefore, down-regulation of SAG12 expression during dark-induced senescence by over-expression of YUCCA6 (Fig. 2D, H) is likely to be mediated by auxin.. Transcription factors are fundamental elements of the central regulatory networks for plant processes. It has been shown that the expression of 185 transcription factor genes changes during senescence (Balazadeh et al., 2008). Specifically, NAC family transcription factors are shown to be involved in senescence (Guo et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2009). Among over 100 NAC family members, the transcripts of 20 NAC transcription factors including A. thaliana NAC1/ANAC021 (At1g56010) and NAC6/ANAC092 (At5g39610) are up-regulated during the senescence process (Balazadeh et al., 2008). Kim et al. (2009) showed that loss-of-function mutation in NAC6 resulted in delayed leaf senescence and NAC6 transcripts increased during senescence. Accordingly, it was found that the expression of A. thaliana NAC1 and NAC6 gradually increased in wild-type leaves during dark-induced senescence (Fig. 7B, D), paralleling the decrease in the free IAA content of the leaves (Fig. 5). Expression of NAC1 and NAC6 gradually increased in yuc6-1D leaves also during dark-induced senescence (Fig. 7B, D), albeit to a much lower extent compared with the wild type. NAC1 and NAC6 expression in leaves of a 35S:YUC6 transgenic plant also remained lower than in the wild type but was comparable with that of yuc6-1D during dark-induced senescence (Fig. 7A, C). These data provide further molecular evidence that over-expression of YUCCA6, and thereby elevated auxin, delays dark-induced leaf senescence. Since NAC6 is known to control age-related senescence positively, NAC6 transcripts are up-regulated during senescence and microarray analyses have shown that NAC6 controls the expression of a large percentage of SAGs (Kim et al., 2009; Balazadeh et al., 2010), it is possible that elevated auxin delays senescence, in part through the regulation of levels of the transcription factor NAC6.. . Fig. 7.. . Over-expression of YUCCA6 suppresses the up-regulation of NAC1/ANAC021 and NAC6/ANAC092 during dark-induced senescence. Third and fourth rosette leaves of 3.5-week-old plants were detached and incubated in 3 mM MES buffer (pH 5.7) in the dark. (A) NAC1 and (C) NAC6 expression levels were measured in wild-type (WT), yuc6-1D, and 35S:YUC6 leaves with (grey) or without (white) 5-d dark treatment. Expression levels of (B) NAC1 and (D) NAC6 during dark treatment were measured in WT (white) and yuc6-1D (grey) during dark incubation. UBQ10 was used for an internal control. Data represent the mean SD (n=3)..
