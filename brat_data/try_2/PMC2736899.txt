Results. . Loss-of-function ETR2 mutants display altered trichome branching. To determine if any of the Arabidopsis ethylene receptor GOF or LOF mutants had altered trichome development, as compared to the wild type (Columbia), mutant lines of all five Arabidopsis receptors were screened. Only LOF mutations to the ETR2 receptor caused trichome branching abnormalities among the ethylene receptor mutants tested (etr1-1, etr1-5, etr1-6, etr1-7, ers1-1, ers1-3, ers2-1, ers2-3, etr2-1, etr2-2, etr2-3, ein4-1, ein4-4, ein4-7). Wild-type rosette leaves in Arabidopsis have 1% two-branched trichomes, 97% three-branched trichomes, and 2% four-branched trichomes (as measured on leaf 5; n=798 trichomes). The LOF mutants of ETR2 differed from the wild type (Fig. 1). While the GOF mutant, etr2-1 (Fig. 1B), had trichomes similar to the wild type (Fig. 1A), with 2% two-branched trichomes, 93% three-branched trichomes, and 5% four-branched trichomes (n=950 trichomes), etr2-2 (a LOF mutant; Fig. 1C) lacked four-branched trichomes and instead had 17% two-branched trichomes, and 83% three-branched trichomes (n=1349 trichomes). The most altered phenotype was observed in the LOF mutant etr2-3 (Fig. 1D), which had 100% unbranched trichomes (n=1253 trichomes). This was true on rosette leaves, flowering stalks, and on sepals, as compared to the wild type which has both two-branched and unbranched trichomes on the flowering stalks and sepals. Representative images of the wild type, etr2-1, etr2-2, and etr2-3 are shown in Fig. 1.. . Fig. 1.. . Representative trichome branching in wild type and three etr2 mutants. Trichomes of the wild type are predominantly three-branched (A) as are trichomes of etr2-1 (B). The etr2-2 mutant has a higher number of two-branched trichomes (C) while etr2-3 has only unbranched trichomes (D). Scale bars=200 mum.. . . . It has previously been shown that ETR2 is expressed in mature leaves (Sakai et al., 1998; Grefen et al., 2008). Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing an ETR2pro:GUS construct were created to determine if there is a cellular specific expression related to trichomes. It was found in all 13 lines recovered that ETR2 is expressed in juvenile leaves, and that GUS expression was observed in young trichomes in half of these lines (Fig. 2A). During leaf expansion, ETR2 expression became restricted to trichomes (Fig. 2B), while in fully expanded leaves no GUS staining was found in either the leaf epidermal cells or trichomes as has also been shown by Jakoby et al. (2008). These data demonstrate that ETR2 is expressed in trichomes early in development during which the initiation of trichome branching occurs.. . Fig. 2.. . ETR2 is expressed in young leaves and mature trichomes. (A) ETR2pro:GUS is expressed in very young leaves and trichomes (Scale bar=1 mm). (B) ETR2pro:GUS is restricted to fully branched trichomes only (Scale bar=1 mm).. . . . . . Microtubule cytoskeleton organization is altered in etr2-3. To date, mutations that cause a reduction in trichome branching either affect the level of endoreduplication within the cell or the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton (Mathur and Chua, 2000). Trichomes were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to determine the DNA content of etr2-3 trichomes as compared to the wild type. Epidermal pavement cells generally have between 2C and 16C of DNA, while trichomes have between 4C to 64C, with the majority containing an average of 32C (Melaragno et al., 1993). It was found that average DNA content between etr2-3 and wild-type trichomes was not significantly different (Fig. 3A; P<0.05). This indicates that ETR2 affects trichome branching in an endoreduplication-independent manner.. . Fig. 3.. . ETR2 affects microtubule assembly. (A) Both wild-type (black bar) and etr2-3 (grey bar) nuclei show the same level of endoreduplication (P<0.05, t test). (B) Wild-type trichomes expressing 35S:MAP4-GFP show a longitudinal fine mesh of microtubules (scale bar=50 mum). Inset is a magnification of longitudinally oriented microtubules in the stalk of the trichome.

(D) Branching is induced in etr2-3 when treated with 20 muM paclitaxol for 2 h and then grown on MS medium until new leaves are produced (scale bar=100 mum). (E) etr2-335S:MAP4-GFP lines which express the highest level of MAP4-GFP show trichome branching and normal microtubule assembly (scale bar=70 mum).

Asterisk indicates statistically significant difference from the wild type (P<0.05, t test).. . . . Assembly and structural arrangement of microtubules are maintained in part by MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEINs (MAPs) (Igarashi et al., 2000; Smertenko et al., 2000). This association has been exploited through the use of a GFP-labelled MAP4 protein to image the microtubule cytoskeleton in a number of living plant cell types (Olson et al., 1994; Marc et al., 1998). To image the microtubule cytoskeleton in developing trichomes, etr2-3 was crossed with transgenic Arabidopsis expressing 35S:MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN4-GFP (35S:MAP4-GFP). Overexpression of the MAP4 has also been shown to cause stabilization of microtubule assembly (Marc et al., 1998). In 35S:MAP4-GFP lines this can lead to artefacts such as bulging hypocotyl cells, thickened trichomes or induced trichome branching. Despite this drawback, with careful screening these lines have been widely used throughout the literature (Olson et al., 1995; Marc et al., 1998; Kragler et al., 2003; Shevchenko et al., 2008). The etr2-3 35S:MAP4-GFP double mutants were therefore carefully screened for lines which did not display these artefacts. It was found that in the early stages of wild-type trichome outgrowth, the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton appears to criss-cross the stalk of the trichome. A similar pattern was observed in very young trichomes of etr2-3. Following trichome branching, the microtubule cytoskeleton re-aligns into a longitudinal orientation (Fig. 3B, inset). It is at this stage that differences between wild-type and etr2-3 trichomes were observed. While some of the etr2-3 trichomes showed normal longitudinal microtubules in nearly mature trichomes, a subset of trichomes exhibited a random and disorganized microtubule network that showed evidence of depolymerization (Fig. 3C, inset). Trichomes of etr2-3 also lacked the dense knots of microtubules typically present in branching trichomes. There was no visible GFP signal in fully mature etr2-3 trichomes. Thus, microtubule assembly in etr2-3 trichomes nearing maturity do not consistently show the same organization as in the wild type.. In previously characterized mutants that show altered microtubule assembly, it has been shown that pharmacological stabilization of microtubules can induce branching in trichomes (Mathur and Chua, 2000). When etr2-3 was treated with high concentrations of paclitaxol, a known stabilizer of microtubule assembly (Schiff et al., 1979; De Brabander et al., 1981; Verde et al., 1991; Hyman and Karsenti, 1998), approximately 50% of the trichomes developed branch initials or unbranched stalks with incipient branch bulges (Fig. 3D). The cytoskeleton of 2 etr2-3, 35S:MAP4-GFP double mutant lines that were identified as having a highly stabilized microtubule cytoskeleton (evidenced by bulging hypocotyl cells, intense GFP signal, as well as a mixture of unbranched and branched trichomes) were also analysed. The two-branched trichomes in these lines had blunt-ended branch tips, a phenotype that has been associated with stabilized microtubules in sti (Mathur and Chua, 2000) and the microtubule cytoskeleton appeared normal (Fig. 3E). Therefore stabilization of microtubule assembly by either overexpression of MAP4 or application of paclitaxol can partially rescue the etr2-3 mutant phenotype.. If the etr2-3 mutant is affected in the assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton, it should be possible to disrupt cytoskeletal assembly more easily in the etr2-3 mutant compared to the wild type. This was studied by treating etr2-1, etr2-3, and the wild type with increasing concentrations of oryzalin. Oryzalin has been shown to depolymerize microtubules, leading to root hair branching, an increase in the girth of trichomes, and alteration of the shape of the root tip (Baskin et al., 1994). While analysis of root hair branching is not directly associated with trichome branching, branching of the root hairs can be accurately quantified and used to support our findings that cytoskeletal assembly is impaired in these mutants. In MS media, etr2-3 had a higher number of branched root hairs than the wild type (Fig. 3F). Three days after the addition of 0.1 muM oryzalin to the media, the number of branched root hairs in etr2-3 increased significantly as compared to the wild type or etr2-1 (P<0.05). The wild type required a concentration of 1.0 muM oryzalin before a significant increase in root hair branching was detected. By contrast, the GOF mutant etr2-1, had a significantly lower number of branched root hairs at 1.0 muM oryzalin compared to the wild type (P<0.05). Therefore, LOF and GOF mutations to ETR2 have opposite effects on the sensitivity to oryzalin.. . . Epistatic crosses and expression analysis place ETR2 in the trichome development pathway. The etr2-3 mutant was crossed with several trichome branching mutants to gain insight into the position of ETR2 in the known trichome morphogenesis signalling pathway. Representative pictures of the original mutants (Fig. 4B, D, F, H, J) and the resulting double mutants (Fig. 4C, E, G, I, K, L) are shown and percentages of branch types are shown in Table 1. When crossed with glabra3 (gl3), which has two-branched trichomes (Fig. 4B), the double mutant had puddle-like, unbranched trichomes that grew parallel to the leaf surface (Fig. 4C). When crossed with spy-5 (Fig. 4D), a mutant in the gibberellin pathway with increased trichome branching, the resulting double mutant had a mixture of two- and three-branched trichomes (Fig. 4E). Crossing of etr2-3 with glabra2 (gl2) (Fig. 4F) resulted in leaves with a mixture of two branched and unbranched trichomes (Fig. 4G). The glabra2 and etr2-3 glabra2 double mutants have approximately the same proportion of unbranched and two branched trichomes (Table 1). There were, however, distinct differences in the morphology of the trichomes between gl2 and the double mutant. Trichomes of the double mutant were fully extended and sharp tipped. Conversely, trichomes on the first leaves of gl2 either did not fully extend (for unbranched trichomes) or showed a high proportion of branched trichomes with very short branches. When etr2-3 was crossed to fasciata1 (fas1), a loss-of-function mutation to CAF1 that has trichomes with increased branching (Fig. 4H), the resulting double mutant had 100% unbranched trichomes (Fig. 4I). Based on the epistatic relationship between FAS1 and ETR2, etr2-3 was crossed to try, a mutant with clumped trichomes that exhibits supernumerary branches. The try etr2-3 double mutant had unbranched trichomes that, in a few cases appeared clumped (Fig. 4K). A cross was also performed between fas1-1 and try and the double mutant had the trichome branching and clustering phenotype of try (Fig. 4L). Taken together, these results suggest that ETR2 signals in a pathway that is parallel to GL2, GL3, and gibberellic acid, but that ETR2 operates in the same pathway as CAF1 and TRY.. . Table 1.. .

To characterize further how ETR2 affects the expression of genes involved in the regulation of trichome branching, the expression levels of five key trichome branching regulators were analysed (Fig. 4M). Expression was performed in etr2-1, etr2-3, and fas1-1 and compared to their respective wild type (Col-0 for the first two mutants and Enk-2 for fas1-1). Because epistatic analysis suggested that ETR2 signals in the same pathway as CAF1, the expression level of FAS1 in the etr2-3 and etr2-1 mutants was also tested. It was found that expression levels of FAS1 in etr2-3 were significantly increased, while they were not significantly affected in etr2-1 (P<0.05). This would support the epistatic results which suggest that ETR2 acts upstream of CAF1. It was found that TRY expression was significantly increased in etr2-3, while it was significantly repressed in etr2-1 (Fig. 4M). In the fas1-1 mutant TRY expression is also significantly repressed. As TRY is a known regulator of STI and ZWI, the expression patterns of these two genes were considered. It was determined that STI was significantly down-regulated in etr2-3 and increased in etr2-1 but was unaffected in fas1-1. There was no significant difference in expression of ZWI in any of the mutants tested. As a control, the level of expression of AN was tested as it is a gene known to be in a separate trichome branching pathway from TRY, and presumably unaffected by ETR2. The expression levels in both ethylene mutants was not significantly different from the wild type (Fig. 4M). These data confirm that ETR2 is in the same signalling pathway as CAF1 and that downstream components of this regulatory network are TRY and STI..
