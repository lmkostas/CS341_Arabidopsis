RESULTSTAV is responsible for CaMV infection-mediated interference with siR255 biogenesisCaMV infection in Arabidopsis thaliana causes overaccumulation of several RDR6-dependent precursors of TAS1-derived tasiRNA siR255 (35) (Figure 2). To test whether the CaMV TAV protein implicated in silencing suppression contributes to this effect, we analyzed two Arabidopsis transgenic lines that constitutively express TAV proteins from the CaMV strains CM1841 and D4 (lines CM-2 and D4-2, respectively) (38). Both lines accumulate comparable levels of TAV, but the CM1841 TAV plants develop extensive chlorotic symptoms, whereas the D4 plants are nearly symptom-less (38). Blot hybridization analysis of total plant RNA using the siR255-specific probe showed that both transgenic lines accumulate, in addition to the 21-nt siR255, several precursors ranging in size from 35 to 600 nt. The sizes and relative abundances of these RNAs were very similar in both transgenic lines as well as in control Col-0 (wt) plants infected with CaMV strain CM1841. Moreover, CaMV infection of the TAV transgenic lines did not alter these patterns of RNA accumulation (Figure 2). Notably, these long precursors of siR255 are also present in non-infected wt plants, albeit at very low levels (Figure 2 and data not shown). The levels of siR255 normalized for the U6 loading control were reduced to 55% of the wild-type levels in CaMV-infected plants. Of the two TAV transgenic lines, significant reduction in siR255 levels was observed only in the D4 line (see Figures 2 and 3). The stronger interference with siR255 biogenesis in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line was also apparent from a higher ratio of the siR255 precursors (a total of several RNAs ranging from 35 to 600 nt) to the 21 nt siR255 product, compared to the CM1841 line (Figure 2, see the imbedded table). Nonetheless, the CM1841 line accumulated somewhat higher amounts of the siR255 precursors.. Figure 2.Accumulation of tasiRNA precursors in CaMV-infected and TAV transgenic plants. Total RNA from pools of CaMV-infected (+) or mock-inoculated (-) wild-type plants (Col-0) and TAV transgenic lines CM1841 and D4 harvested 1 month post-inoculation were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization (using 15% PAGE). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes for the tasiRNAs TAS1a/b/c siR255, TAS3a 5D7(+), the miRNAs miR173, miR390 and miR828, CaMV-derived siRNAs and the small nuclear RNA U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). Positions of ssRNA markers are indicated. U6 signal serves as a loading control. The U6-normalized, relative levels of miRNAs are shown under the respective scan. The U6-normalized, relative levels of the tasiRNAs and the tasiRNA precursors (a total of several RNAs ranging from 35 to 600 nt) as well as the precursor/tasiRNA ratios are shown in the table. For each miRNA and tasiRNA, its accumulation in the uninfected, nontransgenic Arabidopsis (lane 1) was set to 1.0 (underlined). For the tasiRNA precursors, their accumulation was related to the corresponding tasiRNA.We made a time-course analysis of the TAV effect on the siR255-generating pathway using pools of the transgenic and the wt plants harvested 15, 30 and 45 days post-germination. Wt plants bolted and started to flower 30-45 days post-germination, whereas the transgenic lines displayed slower growth and flowered 1 (CM1841) or 2 (D4) months later, confirming earlier observations (32). In the CM1841 line, the siR255 precursors were equally abundant at all three time points. In contrast, the D4 line accumulated lower amounts of the precursors at the two earlier time points (Figure 3). Despite the difference in accumulation of the precursors, at each time point the precursors/tasiRNA ratio was about two to three times higher in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line (Figure 3), confirming that TAV expression in the D4 line has a stronger negative impact on tasiRNA processing. Interestingly, the levels of miR173 that initiates the siR255-generating pathway (Figure 1) were increased pronouncedly in the CM1841 line (Figure 3), thus correlating with higher accumulation of the siR255 precursors.. Figure 3.Differential impact of TAV proteins from CaMV strains CM1841 and D4 on TAS1 versus TAS3 tasiRNAs and their precursors. Total RNA from pools of noninfected, wild-type (Col-0) plants and TAV transgenic lines CM1841 and D4 harvested at 15, 30 and 45 days post-germination were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization (15% PAGE). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes for the tasiRNAs TAS1a/b/c siR255, TAS1a/b/c siR255*, TAS3a 5D7(+), TAS3a 5D7(-), the miRNAs miR173, miR390 and miR172, and U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). U6 signal serves as a loading control. The U6-normalized, relative levels of the tasiRNAs and the tasiRNA precursors (a total of several RNAs ranging from 35 to 600 nt) as well as the precursor/tasiRNA ratios are shown in the two tables. The U6-normalized, relative levels of miRNAs are shown under the respective scan. For each miRNA and tasiRNA, its accumulation in the nontransgenic Arabidopsis at day 15 (lane 1) was set to 1.0 (underlined). For the tasiRNA precursors, their accumulation was related to the corresponding tasiRNA.Further analysis of infected and TAV transgenic plants using probes specific for both strands of a presumed tasiRNA duplex (siR255/siR255*) detected longer RNAs identical in size and relative abundance but negligible levels of 21-nt siR255* (Figure 3). These results, and our earlier findings for CaMV-infected wt plants (35) (Figure 4) suggest that most larger-sized RNAs are potentially double-stranded molecules. Taken together, we conclude that the CaMV TAV protein is solely responsible for the CaMV-mediated interference with siR255 biogenesis.. Figure 4.Impact of CaMV infection on the biogenesis of tasiRNAs from different TAS loci. Total RNA from pools of CaMV-infected (+) and mock-inoculated wild type (Col-0) plants harvested 1 month post-inoculation were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization (15% PAGE). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes for the tasiRNAs TAS1a/b/c siR255, TAS1a/b/c siR255*, TAS1a/b 3D1(+), TAS1a/b 3D1(-), TAS2 siR612, TAS2 siR1940, TAS3a 5D7(+), the miRNA miR173, the 5S rDNA repeat-associated siRNA siR1003 and U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). U6 signal serves as a loading control. Positions of ssRNA markers are indicated. Asterisks indicate the dsRNAs hybridized to both the internal (TAS1a/b/c siR255- and siR255*-specific) and the miR173-terminal [TAS1a/b 3D1(+)- and 3D1(-)-specific] probes.Analysis of dsRNA precursors of TAS1 tasiRNAssiR255 is encoded by three TAS1 family loci TAS1a, TAS1b and TAS1c at processing positions 3D6(+), 3D6(+) and 3D3(+), respectively, located six, six and three 21-nt cycles downstream of the miR173 cleavage site (6). Four additional siR255-like species are encoded by TAS1a, TAS1b and TAS1c (Figure 1B, filled boxes). To further characterize the long RNAs that hybridize to the siR255- and the siR255*-specific probes in CaMV-infected plants (35), we re-probed the respective blot with P-32 labeled, 21- and 19-nt-long DNA oligonucleotides (Table S1) complementary to the predicted TAS1a 21-nt siRNAs 3D1(+) and 3D1(-) (Figure 1B). These probes are expected to hybridize to the termini of presumed dsRNAs from TAS1a and TAS1b with only 1-nt mismatch at the end but not to those from TAS1c and TAS2 with >4 mismatches. Such dsRNAs could be either the hypothetical full-length products of RDR6 activity or partially processed products from an end opposite to the miR173 cleavage site. We detected 21-nt TAS1a 3D1(+) species in both mock control and CaMV-infected plants, but no 3D1(-) species (Figure 4). Both TAS1a 3D1 (+) and 3D1(-) specific probes also strongly hybridized to four of the 12 longer RNAs detectable with siR255- and siR255*-specific probes in CaMV-infected plant samples (indicated with asterisks in Figure 4).We also analyzed the siR255 precursors in DCL-deficient single, double and triple mutants dcl2, dcl3, dcl4, dcl23, dcl34 and dcl234 as well as RDR-deficient mutants rdr2 and rdr6, described earlier (35). To better resolve longer precursors of tasiRNAs and identify single-stranded (ss) TAS1 transcripts of 800-1000 nt, total RNA was separated using 5% PAGE (Figure 5B) and low-molecular-weight RNAs were separated using 18% PAGE (Figure 5A). The size range of the single-stranded, siR255-containing RNAs we detected (Figure 5B) corresponded to TAS1a, 1b and 1c transcripts of 929, 838 and 989 nt in length, respectively. Strikingly, accumulation of most TAS1-derived RNAs was perturbed in the dcl4 mutant backgrounds relative to the wt and the other dcl mutants (Figure 5A and B). Thus, these RNAs may represent intermediates of DCL4-mediated processing of the longest (full-length) dsRNA precursors of 500-600 bp, which accumulated equally in the wt and all the dcl mutant plants infected with CaMV (Figure 5B). In the absence of DCL4, other DCLs appear to compensate for its deficiency: abundant 22-nt sRNA and several longer intermediates accumulating in dcl4 and dcl34 are DCL2-dependent (Figure 5A and B). The 24- and 25-nt sRNAs and two RNAs migrating at the ca. 80-nt position are DCL3-dependent (Figure 5A). The RNA pattern in dcl234 indicates that full-length precursors of siR255 are partially processed by DCL1 resulting in a distinct pattern of RNA intermediates but no detectable siRNAs (Figure 5). Finally, none of the precursors or mature TAS1 tasiRNAs was detected in rdr6 but all were detected in rdr2 (Figure 5A), showing that RDR6 is required for biogenesis of these tasiRNA precursors. Similar results were obtained for precursors and tasiRNAs encoded by TAS2 and TAS3 loci (data not shown).. Figure 5.Dissection of the siR255-generating pathway in CaMV-infected DCL- and RDR-deficient mutants. RNA samples from CaMV-infected wild type (Col-0), the single (dcl2-5, dcl3-1 and dcl4-2), double (dcl2 dcl3, dcl3 dcl4; 35) or triple (dcl2 dcl3 dcl4; 35) DCL-deficient and the RDR2- (rdr6-15) and the RDR6-deficient (rdr2-1) mutants harvested 1 month post-inoculation were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization using 18% PAGE for low-molecular-weight RNA (A) and 5% PAGE for total RNA (B). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes for TAS1a/b/c siR255, TAS1a/b/c siR255*, miR173, CaMV siRNAs and U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). U6 signal serves as a loading control. Positions of ssRNA markers are indicated. The dsRNAs hybridized to the miR173-terminal [TAS1a/b 3D1(+)- and 3D1(-)-specific] probes in Figure 4 are indicated by asterisks.CaMV infection and TAV expression interfere with the pathways generating the four known tasiRNA familiesWe also investigated if expression of the TAS2-TAS4 families was affected by CaMV infection. The single TAS2 locus encodes siR614 and siR1940 species as the fifth cycle duplex [3D5(+) and 3D5(-)] downstream of the miR173 site (6) (Figure 1B). In uninfected plants, the probes specific for these tasiRNAs identified the expected 21-nt molecules. CaMV infection induced the accumulation of four additional longer RNAs, whose sizes were similar in both polarities (Figure 4). A similar pattern of TAS2 long dsRNAs was found in the two TAV transgenic lines, with higher levels accumulating in the CM1841 line and a higher precursor/tasiRNA ratio in the D4 line (Figure S1). These findings indicate that CaMV infection and expression of TAV proteins interfere in a similar manner with miR173-initiated, TAS1 and TAS2 pathways.The miR390-initiated tasiRNAs are derived from three loci of the TAS3 family (Figure 1), with TAS3a giving rise to most of the sRNA reads (9). The TAS3a-specific tasiRNA 5D7(+) but not its passenger strand 5D7(-) was detected. Both sense and antisense probes detected long precursors of TAS3a tasiRNAs in CaMV-infected, but not mock-inoculated, wt plants and in both TAV transgenic lines (Figures 2 and 3). Note that these precursors were much less abundant in CaMV-infected plants than in the TAV transgenic lines (Figure 2). In contrast to TAS1 and TAS2, the TAS3a tasiRNA precursors were more abundant in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line and were inversely correlated in abundance with their mature tasiRNAs (Figure 3). Nonetheless, the precursors/tasiRNA ratio was comparable for both TAS3a and TAS1/TAS2 in the D4 line, whereas it was higher for TAS1/TAS2 than TAS3a in the CM1841 line (Figure 3). This suggests that TAV expression in the D4 line exerts strong and comparable effects on both the miR173- and the miR390-initiated tasiRNA biogenesis, whereas TAV expression in the CM1841 line has generally weaker effects on both but a more pronounced effect on the miR173-initiated tasiRNA biogenesis.The miR828-initiated tasiRNAs derived from the single TAS4 locus (11) are of very low abundance (9). We did not detect any small RNA in control Col-0 plants with the probes specific for the cloned 21 nt TAS4 siR81(-) species or its passenger strand. In both CaMV-infected and TAV transgenic plants, however, 24-26 nt small RNA of one polarity was detected using the siR81(-)-specific probe (Figures 4 and S1). This probe, but not its reverse complement (data not shown), detected long RNAs that were equally abundant in control and CaMV-infected plants, but overaccumulated in TAV transgenic plants. At least one distinct long RNA appears to be CaMV TAV-specific (indicated with asterisk in Figure S1). Thus, CaMV infection and TAV expression both interfere with the TAS4 biogenesis.CaMV infection and TAV expression upregulate both tasiRNA targets and components of tasiRNA biogenesisOur finding that TAV expression dramatically increased the accumulation of tasiRNA precursors and the ratio of precursors to tasiRNA suggests that TAV impairs processing of RDR6-dependent dsRNA to tasiRNA by DCL4. However, the levels of tasiRNAs themselves are not drastically reduced in CaMV-infected or TAV D4 plants, and, in some samples of the CM1841 plants, are even slightly increased (Figures 2 and 3). This could be due to incomplete spatial and/or temporal overlap of viral infection (TAV protein production) and the tasiRNA biogenesis and activity pathways. Additionally, a feedback regulation may partially or fully restore normal levels of tasiRNAs. We therefore investigated if the action of tasiRNAs in knocking down their target gene transcripts is affected and whether the genes mediating tasiRNA biogenesis are regulated in CaMV-infected and TAV transgenic plants. Using the ATH1 whole-genome microarray, we profiled total RNA from CaMV-infected versus mock-inoculated wt (Col-0) and tasiRNA-deficient dcl234 plants (harvested 1 month post-inoculation) as well as from non-infected transgenic versus wt (Col-0) plants harvested 15 days post-germination. Confirming the above time-course experiment (Figure 3), the siR255 precursors were more abundant in the CM1841 than in the D4 line samples (Figure S2; note that, of the two independent, CM1841 TAV-expressing lines shown, CM-2 was profiled). Notably, the TAV transgene transcript levels were higher in the D4 line than in the two CM1841 lines CM-2 and CM-6 (Figure S2), which is consistent with slightly higher accumulation of TAV protein and its breakdown products in this D4 line (D4-2) compared to the CM1841 lines (38; and data not shown). The higher expression of TAV protein in the D4 line might account for the stronger negative impact on tasiRNA biogenesis in this line as inferred above from the dsRNA precursors/tasiRNA ratios. However we cannot exclude that 5% difference at the amino acid level between the two TAV proteins is responsible for the observed effects.The microarray analysis showed that the key genes involved in tasiRNA biogenesis including DCL4, DRB4 and AGO7 were upregulated by both CaMV infection and TAV expression (Figure 6A, Table S2), thus supporting the feedback regulation hypothesis. Notably, the D4 line exhibited a more pronounced upregulation of these genes than the CM1841 line. Additionally, DCL1 and RDR6 were found to be modestly upregulated in the D4 line (Figure 6A, Table S2). The transcript levels of DRB4 and AGO7 were elevated to similar levels in both CaMV-infected wild-type and dcl234 plants (Figure 6A, Table S2). Interestingly, residual levels of a DCL4 transcript were detected in dcl234 carrying a T-DNA insertion in the 23rd exon of the DCL4 gene and those were also slightly elevated upon CaMV infection. Furthermore, DCL1 was also modestly upregulated in CaMV-infected dcl234 (Figure 6A, Table S2). Other genes presently implicated in the miRNA- and tasiRNA-generating pathways, namely AGO1, HYL1/DRB1, HEN1, SE, SGS3 and SDE5 were not affected by the CaMV challenges. Of the silencing-related genes not implicated in the tasiRNA pathway so far, notable CaMV-mediated upregulation was found for AGO2, TOUSLED, NRPD1a, DDM1, DME, HDA18, RPA2 and FAS2, whereas DRB3 was downregulated (data not shown).. Figure 6.Response of the Arabidopsis transcriptome to CaMV infection and TAV transgene expression reveals the interference with the tasiRNA and secondary siRNA pathways. The microarray analysis data for CaMV-infected (+) and mock-inoculated (-) Arabidopsis wt (Col-O) and the dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple mutant (dcl234) plants as well as for the CaMV TAV transgenic lines CM1841 and D4 are presented as the bar charts with error bars showing standard deviation from mean value of the normalized expression levels (Tables S2-S4) of the genes upregulated in response both to CaMV infection (in Col-0 and dcl234) and TAV expression (in CM1841 and/or D4). The data are for two samples, each representing a pool of three (or, in the case of TAV transgenic lines, nine) plants. The statistically significant changes are indicated by asterisks. (A) shows the genes mediating tasiRNA biogenesis (DCL4, DRB4, AGO7, DCL1 and RDR6), (B) the genes targeted by tasiRNAs of the four TAS families (indicated in brackets) and (C) the miRNA targets (the miRNA indicated in brackets) and other genes silenced by secondary siRNAs.Further analysis of the microarrays revealed that several predicted tasiRNA target genes were modestly upregulated by CaMV infection (Figure 6B, Table S3). These included (i) two expressed protein genes targeted by siR255 and three other tasiRNAs encoded by the TAS1 a/b/c loci, (ii) six PPR genes targeted by single or multiple siRNAs derived from TAS1a or TAS2 loci, (iii) AFR4 targeted by two TAS3a siRNAs and (iv) MYB113 targeted by the TAS4 siR81(-). Thus, subsets of the targets for all the known TAS families were elevated. Most of these were also upregulated in noninfected dcl234 plants, consistent with the tasiRNA deficiency. Interestingly, the target genes unaffected in the noninfected dcl234 plants were upregulated when these plants were infected with CaMV (Figure 6B, Table S3). Subsets of targets for tasiRNA in all four TAS families were also elevated in TAV transgenic lines (Figure 6B, Table S3). The target genes affected and the degree of upregulation depended on both the TAV line and the TAS family. The CM1841 TAV expression had the most pronounced effect on the TAS4 targets with all three known targets of siR81(-) being strongly upregulated, while its effect on the TAS1 and TAS3 targets was less pronounced and on the TAS2 targets rather negligible. In contrast, the D4 TAV expression had almost no effect on the TAS4 targets, whereas most of the TAS2 targets were strongly upregulated (Figure 6B, Table S3). Furthermore, one of the two TAS1 targets and the TAS3 target ARF4 were more pronouncedly upregulated in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line, and the D4 line showed slightly elevated levels of the second TAS3 target, ARF3 (Figure 6B, Table S3).The gene At2g39680 imbedded within TAS2 (At2g39681) in opposite orientation (7) was upregulated upon CaMV infection and in both TAV transgenic lines (Figure 6B, Table S3). Together with the earlier report on its upregulation in rdr6 (41), our data suggest that At2g39680 is a target of TAS2-derived tasiRNAs, the biogenesis of which is impaired by CaMV TAV.Many targets of tasiRNAs give rise to RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs, likely to be involved in amplification of silencing (9). Thus, CaMV TAV-mediated interference with secondary siRNA production could account for upregulation of some of the tasiRNA targets (Table S3). Our further inspection of the transcriptome profiles revealed that both CaMV infection and TAV expression (in one or both lines) cause upregulation of several other Arabidopsis genes (Figure 6C, Table S4) that normally give rise to RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs (9). Interestingly, many of these genes are targets of miRNAs, like the TAS genes themselves. Notably, TAV expression in the D4 line elevated transcript levels for most of these genes, whereas the CM1841 line showed elevated levels for only a few of them (Figure 6C), which is similar to the above observations for the TAS2 targets (Figure 6B). The vast majority of other miRNA targets, which does not give rise to secondary siRNAs, was not upregulated in CaMV-infected or TAV transgenic plants (data not shown), suggesting that TAV does not interfere with miRNA action. The notable exception is AGO1, which represents an miRNA target gene generating secondary siRNAs that was not upregulated by TAV (data not shown). However, expression of this gene is auto-regulated at both post-transcriptional and transcriptional levels by a complex fine-tuning mechanism (42), which could fully compensate for the inhibitory effect of TAV.CaMV interferes with production of RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs from a silenced transgeneOur transcriptome analysis suggests that TAV interferes with RDR6-dependent secondary siRNA pathways. To test this hypothesis we used the Arabidopsis GFP  GF-FG transgenic line (22), which carries a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and a second transgene expressing an inverted repeat cognate to the GF portion of the GFP coding region (GF-FG). In this system, the 21-nt primary siRNAs produced by DCL4-mediated processing of the GF-FG dsRNA are thought to target the GFP transcript for cleavage and degradation. The latter process triggers RDR6-dependent production of secondary siRNAs from the P region of the GFP transgene (Figure 7A). The rdr6 mutation introduced into the GFP  GF-FG line has been shown to eliminate the secondary siRNAs without affecting accumulation of primary siRNAs or GFP silencing (22). CaMV infection of the GFP  GF-FG line did not result in re-appearance of GFP fluorescence under UV light (data not shown), indicating that GFP silencing was not suppressed. Consistent with the silenced GFP phenotype, RNA blot hybridization of total plant RNA with probes specific to the GF region showed that accumulation of primary siRNAs of both polarities was not reduced but rather slightly increased (Figure 7B). In contrast, accumulation of secondary siRNAs from the P region was substantially reduced during viral infection (Figure 7B). These results suggest that CaMV infection selectively interferes with the biogenesis of RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs without any substantial effect on the production of primary siRNAs and their action in silencing GFP expression.. Figure 7.CaMV infection interferes with the biogenesis of secondary siRNAs derived from the GFP transgene silenced by GF-FG dsRNA. (A) Model for the biogenesis of the primary (GF) and the secondary (P) siRNAs derived from the GF-FG and the GFP transgenes, respectively, in the transgenic GF-FG  GFP line. The structures of the two transgenes present in this line as shown schematically, with the CaMV 35S promoter indicated by an arrow shape. In the GF-FG transgene the inverted repeat of the GF region of the GFP coding sequence is equipped with an intron. The Pol II transcription generates a GF-FG transcript that folds back into perfect dsRNA. The latter is processed by DCL4 (and DCL3) into primary siRNAs (GF). These siRNAs target in trans a GFP mRNA transcribed from the GFP transgene for cleavage at multiple positions within the GF region. The 3-product of these cleavage events retaining an intact P region is converted by RDR6 into dsRNA. The resulting dsRNA is processed by DCL4 (and DCL3) into secondary siRNAs (P). The later step is selectively impaired by CaMV infection as inferred from the following experiment.(B) Total RNA from CaMV-infected (+) and mock-inoculated (-) transgenic GF-FG X GFP line plants harvested 1 month post-inoculation were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization (15% PAGE). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes specific for sense and antisense siRNAs derived from the GF and P regions of the GFP coding sequence and U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). U6 signal serves as a loading control. The U6-normalized, relative levels of siRNAs are shown under the respective scans. In each case, the siRNA accumulation in the noninfected Arabidopsis was set to 1.0 (underlined)..
