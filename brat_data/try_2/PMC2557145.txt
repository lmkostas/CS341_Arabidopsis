Results. . pop2 is epistatic to ssadh. To dissect the phenotypic effects of ssadh mutations, we first crossed ssadh mutants with pop2 mutants. Such pop2 ssadh double mutants are expected to lack the potential toxic compounds SSA, GHB (Figure 1A), or metabolites derived from their catabolism. However, pop2 ssadh double mutants would not be able to supply NADH and succinate to the TCA cycle via the GABA shunt, similar to ssadh mutants. Several mutations in the GABA-T (POP2) gene encoding the enzyme degrading GABA into SSA (Figure 1A), were described (pop2-1, pop2-2 and pop2-3 mutants; [21]). By comparing the GABA-T (At3g22200) genomic sequence of Arabidopsis with T-DNA flanking genomic sequences deposited in the databases we identified two additional pop2 alleles designated pop2-4 and pop2-5 (Figure 1B). The genomic DNAs of the mutants were characterized by PCR (Materials and Methods) and the junctions between the T-DNAs and the gene were sequenced. Plants homozygous for the pop2-4 or pop2-5 mutations were phenotypically similar to other pop2 alleles [21]. Homozygous plants grew as wild type but were partially sterile with no or very small siliques (Figure 1C).. We crossed plants homozygous for the ssadh-3 allele with heterozygous POP2/pop2-4 plants. The resulting F1 and F2 plants were genotyped by PCR using oligos specific for pop2-4 or ssadh-3 T-DNA inserts (Figure 2B). F2 plants carrying only the ssadh-3 mutation in the homozygous state exhibited a phenotype reminiscent of ssadh mutants (Figure 2A; plants #10 and #22) while plants homozygous for the pop2-4 mutation exhibited a phenotype reminiscent of pop2 mutants (data not shown). Double pop2-4 ssadh-3 mutants homozygous for both mutations displayed a pop2 phenotype. Indeed, pop2 ssadh double mutants grew as wild type plants but failed to form mature siliques (Figure 2A; plants #28 to 44) and produced less seeds (Figure 2D). The presence of the SSADH and GABA-T mRNAs was assessed in the F2 plants, by reverse transcription and PCR amplification using primers specific for SSADH or GABA-T cDNAs. The full-length GABA-T/POP2 mRNA could not be detected in total RNA extracted from plants homozygous for the pop2-4 mutation (Figure 2C; GABA-T primers; plants #28 to 44) in contrast to POP2/POP2 (Figure 2C; GABA-T primers; plants #25 and 10) or pop2-4/POP2 (Figure 2C; GABA-T primers; plant #22) siblings. Similarly, the full-length SSADH mRNA could not be detected in total RNA extracted from plants homozygous for ssadh-3 (Figure 2C; SSADH primers; plants #10 to 44) in contrast to wild type siblings (Figure 3C; SSADH primers; plant #25). Amplification of an elongation factor mRNA worked equally well on all RNA templates (Figure 2C; control primers). Thus, full length mRNAs corresponding to SSADH or GABA-T could not be detected in the double pop2-4 ssadh-3 mutant. We confirmed these results by crossing other pop2 and ssadh mutant alleles. Heterozygous ssadh-2 mutants as pollinators were crossed to pop2-5 plants, and the resulting F1 and F2 plants were genotyped by PCR using oligos specific for the pop2-5 or ssadh-2 T-DNA inserts (Materials and Methods). Double pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutants displayed a phenotype characteristic of pop2 mutants (Figure S1). Altogether, these results indicate that pop2 is epistatic to ssadh because both pop2-4 ssadh-3 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 double mutants are similar to pop2 mutants.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g002.

EMS-induced mutations in the POP2 gene suppress the phenotype of the ssadh mutation. To gain broader insight into the GABA metabolic pathway and potentially also into regulators of the pathway in Arabidopsis, we decided to isolate suppressors of the ssadh mutation. About 30,000 ssadh-2 seeds were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS; Materials and Methods). None of the resulting M1 plants grew significantly better than ssadh-2 plants, suggesting that no dominant EMS-induced mutations could rescue ssadh-2. Out of 60,000 M2 plants, 137 with improved growth were isolated, potentially carrying recessive suppressor mutations rescuing the ssadh phenotype. The GABA-T gene was sequenced from ten plants that phenotypically resembled pop2 mutants, and two new pop2 mutants with single point mutations were identified designated pop2-6 and pop2-7 (Figure 3A). In ssadh-2 pop2-6, a nucleotide exchange from G to A occurred in exon 11 at position 812 of the GABA-T coding sequence, resulting in an amino acid substitution from glycine to glutamate (Figure 3A) adjacent to an active site residue (Figure 3B; [27]). This line was lost due to its sterility. Plants of another isolated suppressor mutant (ssadh-2 pop2-7) were found to have a nucleotide transition from G to A in exon 13 at position 935 of the GABA-T coding sequence, causing the replacement of glycine with aspartate (Figure 3A) located in the recognition site for binding of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (Figure 3B; [27]). Altogether, our data show that mutations in the GABA-T gene can suppress the ssadh phenotype and that pop2 mutations are epistatic to ssadh mutations.. . . Peroxides accumulate in ssadh mutants but not in pop2 or pop2 ssadh mutants. Previously we reported that ssadh mutants accumulate high levels of ROIs, which is associated with the severe phenotype of these mutants [26]. To further assess the role of the GABA shunt and its derived metabolites in the ssadh phenotype, we tested the accumulation of ROIs in pop2 ssadh plants. After three weeks at 150 mol m-2 s-1 (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours), leaves of ssadh, but not of the wild type, pop2, or pop2 ssadh mutants, were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB), a substance that detects H2O2 in situ [28] (Figure 4). Thus, only ssadh plants accumulate H2O2 as compared to wild type and pop2 or pop2 ssadh.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g004. Figure 4. . H2O2 accumulation in pop2 and ssadh mutants detected by DAB staining.. In situ detection of H2O2 by using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining on pop2-4, ssadh-3, wild type and pop2-4 ssadh-3 plants grown at 150 mol m-2 s-1 white light (WL) for three weeks (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours; temperature day/night, 20/15C). Numbers indicate the percentages of leaves showing DAB staining similar to that presented in the pictures (total number of leaves observed was 12 for wild type, 17 for ssadh-3, 11 for pop2-4, and 15 for pop2-4 ssadh-3).. . . . Peroxide contents were then assessed in the different mutants and the wild type by measuring the thermoluminescence of leaf discs at high temperature. For this, the luminescence of a sample subjected to progressive warming is measured [29], [30]. The chemiluminescence bands observed above 60C, beyond the temperature at which photosystem II is fully destroyed by heat, are related to the thermolysis of peroxides [31], [32]. High temperature thermoluminescence (HTL) bands are indicators of oxidative stress in the sample, and the intensities of HTL bands observed at 130C correlates with the lipid peroxide amounts measured in leaves by chemical methods [31]-[33]. Leaves of plants grown under standard conditions were fixed on small aluminum discs, and both, thermoluminescence and fluorescence F0 were recorded (Materials and Methods). Figure 5 shows representative signals obtained at 0.1C s-1 on leaf samples of wild type, pop2, ssadh and pop2 ssadh plants. The thermoluminescence measured at 135C is about four times higher in ssadh mutants than in wild type or pop2 or pop2 ssadh plants, indicating that ssadh mutants contain more peroxides (Figure 5). The fluorescence F0 recorded simultaneously (Figure S2) reaches a peak at about 65C in the wild type and reflects the heat disruption of photosystem II [34]. The lower heat-induced rise of F0 fluorescence recorded in ssadh mutants as well as the downshift of the F0/Temperature curve to lower temperature shows that photosystem II is impaired in ssadh plants possibly due to high ROI levels. Thus, neither pop2 single mutants or pop2 ssadh double mutants accumulate peroxides at levels comparable to the ones detected in ssadh mutants. More specifically, suppression of the ssadh phenotype by mutations in the POP2/GABA-T gene is associated with elimination of excess ROIs.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g005. Figure 5. . Peroxide accumulation measured by high temperature thermoluminescence emission (HTL) in pop2 and ssadh mutants.. High temperature thermoluminescence emission measured in arbitrary units (a.u.) on rosette leaves fixed on aluminum foils using the custom-made apparatus and software described earlier [29]. Wild type (blue), pop2-4 (green), ssadh-3 (red) and pop2-4 ssadh-3 (black) plants were grown in vitro for three weeks under standard conditions (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours; light intensity, 100-150 mol m-2 s-1; temperature day/night, 20/15 C). The experiment was repeated 10 times and one representative signal is shown. Thermoluminescence heating rate; 0.1 C s-1.. . . . . . pop2 ssadh plants are hypersensitive to SSA and GHB. We suspected that the toxic compound responsible for the phenotype of ssadh plants and ROIs accumulation might be either SSA or an SSA-derived metabolite such as GHB since mutations in the GABA-T gene can rescue the ssadh phenotype and only ssadh plants accumulate ROIs. To further test this hypothesis, we grew ssadh-3 and wild type plants in vitro, with various amounts of SSA directly added to the culture medium. In contrast to wild type plants, the development of ssadh-3 seedlings was significantly affected when plants were grown on plates containing 1 mM SSA (Figure 6A). Higher amounts of SSA had an even more drastic effect on the growth of ssadh-3 (SSA 1.5 and 2 mM; Figure 6A). Thus, our results show that ssadh plants are more sensitive to SSA than wild type plants. We then grew wild type, pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutants on plates containing different amounts of either SSA or GHB (Figure 6B). The ssadh single mutants were not included in the analysis because the development of the plants is already severely impaired under standard conditions of growth. Whereas the growth of wild type, pop2, and pop2 ssadh was indistinguishable from one another on agar plates without additional SSA or GHB, growth of the double pop2 ssadh mutant was severely affected on low concentrations of SSA or GHB (0.1 mM SSA and 0.5 mM GHB; Figure 6B). With increasing amounts of either compound, growth of the pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutant was even more affected than that of single ssadh-3 mutants grown on SSA, most likely due to a more severe phenotype of ssadh-2 than ssadh-3 mutants (Figure 6A; [26]). The phenotypes of wild type plants and the pop2 mutant were similar for all concentrations of SSA and GHB tested (Figure 6B); increased inhibition of plant growth was correlated with increased amounts of SSA or GHB in the medium. Our data show that pop2 ssadh plants are more sensitive to GHB or SSA added to the medium than pop2 single mutants. In animals and possibly in plants, SSA and GHB can be interconverted by the SSA reductase / GHB dehydrogenase (Figure 1A). As both GHB and SSA cannot be properly metabolised in pop2 ssadh plants, it is thus likely that one of the two compounds or both are accumulating in a toxic manner in pop2 ssadh plants in which levels of SSA or GHB are artificially increased.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g006. Figure 6. . Phenotypes of ssadh, pop2, pop2 ssadh and wild type plants grown on media containing SSA or GHB.. (A) Phenotype of the ssadh-3 mutants and Col-0 wild type plants grown in vitro for 14 days under standard conditions (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours; light intensity, 100-150 mol m-2 s-1; temperature day/night, 20/15C) with various amount of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) added to the medium. Photographs of Petri dishes and corresponding magnified pictures are shown. The experiment was repeated three times. (B) Phenotype of Col-0 wild type (WT), pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 plants grown on  MS for 18 days under standard conditions (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours; light intensity, 100-150 mol m-2 s-1; temperature day/night, 20/15C) supplemented with the indicated concentrations of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) or gamma-hydroxbutyrate (GHB).. . . . To further assess this hypothesis, GHB contents in leaves of wild type, pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 plants grown on either SSA or GHB were monitored. To our knowledge, no method is currently available to measure SSA levels in plants. In wild type and pop2, GHB is undetectable when grown on  MS medium (0 mM SSA or GHB; Figure 7A,B) but accumulates with increasing amounts of GHB added to the medium (Figure 7B). The pop2 ssadh mutants were found to accumulate GHB in vast amounts even in response to moderate quantities of SSA (Figure 7A) or GHB (Figure 7B) in the medium. Therefore, pop2 ssadh plants accumulate much more GHB in response to either SSA or GHB added to the medium, compared to wild type and pop2 that both respond in a similar way. Both GHB and SSA added to the medium can therefore be metabolized through the SSADH step in pop2 or the wild type but not in pop2 ssadh. Accumulation of GHB and/or possibly SSA is most likely affecting growth of pop2 ssadh on SSA or GHB (Figure 7B). The results indicate that not the lack of succinate or NADH cause the severe ssadh phenotype, but rather the accumulation of a toxic compound associated with SSA and/ or GHB metabolism, which is associated with high ROI.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g007. Figure 7. . GHB and GABA contents of pop2, pop2 ssadh and wild type plants grown on either SSA or GHB.. (A) and (C) Relative amounts (highest value is 100%) of gamma-hydroxbutyrate (A; GHB) and gamma-aminobutyrate (C; GABA) in leaves of Col wild type (WT), pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutant plants grown on the indicated concentrations of succinic semialdehyde (SSA). Data (relative arbitrary units normalized to plant weight and the abundance of the internal standard ribitol) were sampled using a GC/MS system, n=4-8 (WT), n=2-8 (pop2) and n=2-8 (pop2 ssadh)SE for GHB and n=4-10 (WT), n=2-10 (pop2) and n=1-8 (pop2 ssadh)SE for GABA. (B) and (D) Relative amounts (highest value is 100%) of GHB (B) and GABA (D) in leaves of Col wild type (WT), pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutant plants grown on the indicated concentrations of GHB. Data (relative arbitrary units normalized to plant weight and the abundance of the internal standard ribitol) were sampled using a GC/MS system, n=4-8 (WT), n=4-8 (pop2) and n=1-8 (pop2 ssadh)SE for GHB and n=4-10 (WT), n=4-10 (pop2) and n=2-8 (pop2 ssadh)SE for GABA.. . . . . . pop2 ssadh plants grown on SSA or GHB accumulate GABA. GABA also accumulates in single ssadh-2 mutants [14]. To investigate if high amounts of GABA played a role in causing severe phenotypes of ssadh plants, we measured GABA levels in wild type, pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 plants grown on either SSA or GHB. Compared to wild type, leaves of pop2 and pop2 ssadh contained four and five times more GABA, respectively, when grown on medium without SSA (Figure 7C) or GHB (Figure 7D). Thus, disrupting the GABA degradation pathway at the SSADH [14] or the GABA-T step (see also [21]) or both leads to GABA accumulation. The severe phenotypes of ssadh plants have been restored in double pop2 ssadh mutants to wild type levels, implying that higher GABA contents in these mutants are not impairing growth.. In wild type plants grown on different amounts of SSA or GHB, the GABA content did not differ significantly (with the exception of severely affected plants grown on high SSA), implicating that the GABA pool size of the wild type did not respond to SSA or GHB added to the medium. Interestingly, the pop2 mutant accumulated higher amounts of GABA than wild type plants, especially in response to high SSA (0.4 mM and higher; Figure 7A) and high GHB (2.5 mM; Figure 7B). The double pop2 ssadh mutants accumulated enormous amounts of GABA in leaves in response to even moderate amounts of SSA (0.1 mM; Figure 7C) or GHB (0.5 mM; Figure 7D) in the medium. Hence, GABA accumulates much more in pop2 ssadh than in pop2 in response to either SSA or GHB added to the medium..
