Results. . Heterologously produced CLV3 fusion protein is active in vitro. For the production of the CLV3 proprotein (without the secretion signal peptide), a construct was made in which tandem aligned Trx and His tags were fused to the N-terminus of CLV3 (named TH-ProCLV3). The construct was transformed to E. coli strain BL21(DE3) to produce the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein with a total molecular mass of 23.8 kD. The TH-ProCLV3 was then purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA agarose column (Figure1A), and quantified by Bradford assay [53] after dialyzed using a 7-kD cut-off dialysis bag.. .

In vitro activity assays of the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein in SAMs were performed using clv3-2 and clv1-1 (both in Ler background) mutants of Arabidopsis, as described previously [28]. We observed that the incubation of clv3-2 seedlings with 1 muM TH-ProCLV3 for 8 days led to significant reduced sizes of SAMs (Figure1B, H, and I), while no evident reduction was observed in SAMs of clv1-1 seedlings (Figure1B, D, and E), suggesting that the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein produced in E. coli is active in restricting SAMs in a CLV1-dependent manner.. Similarly, in vitro root assays [17] were performed in Ler and clv2-1 (in Ler background) seedlings. We observed that root growths in Ler seedlings treated with TH-ProCLV3 were inhibited greatly (Figure1C, F, and G), as previously reported in the CLV3 peptide treatment [31], while Ler seedlings grown on media without the fusion protein showed normal root growth (Figure1C, F, and G). In contrast, no evident growth inhibition was observed in clv2-1 seedlings grown on media with TH-ProCLV3 (Figure1C, F, and G). Microscopic examinations revealed that the TH-ProCLV3 treatment resulted in termination of RMs in Ler, but not in clv2-1 (Figure1J-M). These results together suggest that the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein produced in E. coli is active in regulating the sizes of SAMs and RMs.. . . Detection of cleavages in CLV3 fusion protein. To analyze the cleavage of CLV3, we developed a MALDI-Tof MS-based method to profile peptide fragments produced in vitro. Pre-germinated Ler seedlings were inoculated with the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein in a liquid medium, then the media were harvested at different time points and subjected directly to MALDI-Tof MS analyses. The fusion protein inoculated in the same medium without seedlings was used as a control. We observed that the optimal time for analyzing peptide cleavage was 24 hr after the incubation with Ler seedlings, when abundant small peptides with different molecular masses were detected (Additional file 1).. To obtain exact sequences of these fragments, Q-Tof MS/MS analyses were performed in these samples. SEQUEST searches for peptide sequences matching the CLV3 proprotein allowed us to identify over 20 peptides (Figure2). Among them, both the CLV3p12 and the CLV3p13 peptides, the backbones of two candidate forms of mature CLV3 peptides [29,30], were included (Figure2). After alignment of these fragments with the CLV3 proprotein, two most frequently occurring termini, N-terminal Met39 and Arg70, were detected (Figure2), suggesting internal cleavage sites located before Met39 and before Arg70. The cleavage before Arg70 has been previously reported [36], however, the one before Met39 is novel. Since Met39 is located in the non-functional region [28], the cleavage might be not functional relevant.. . Figure 2. . Peptide fragments produced from ProCLV3 after incubations. Matching fragments detected are shown below the ProCLV3 sequence, as identified with Q-Tof MS/MS analyses. The core CLE motif (corresponding to the CLV3 peptide) of CLV3 is shown in blue. The CLV3p12 and CLV3p13 peptides are framed. Two internal cleavage sites, before Met39 and before Arg70, are indicated by arrowheads.. . . . It should be noted that, although peptides with C-terminal His81 and His82 were detected, no peptides with matching N-terminal His82 and Val83 were found. Instead, we detected peptides with variable C-termini. It is plausible that no specific internal cleavage site(s) are present in this region, while carboxypeptidases are involved in processing the C-terminus of the CLV3. Recently, Tamaki et al. showed that an endosome-localized SOL1 carboxypeptidase is responsible for removing the C-terminal Arg residue from the CLE19 proprotein [54]. Since intact Ler seedlings were used in our assay, the C-terminal processing activities detected may come from non-specific extracellular carboxypeptidases instead of SOL1.. . . N-terminal flanking sequence affected the cleavage of CLV3. To examine if residues flanking the N-terminus of the CLV3 peptide are required for internal cleavage, we chemically synthesized the CLV3p12 and peptides with additional 1, 3, 4 or 5 residues, namely L-CLV3p13, EEL-CLV3p15, HEEL-CLV3p16 and LHEEL-CLV3p17. These peptides were inoculated in liquid media with Arabidopsis (Ler) seedlings, and medium samples were harvested at different time points and subjected directly to MALDI-Tof MS analyses. We observed that the optimal time for analyzing the cleavage of these peptides was 3 d after the inoculation, when abundant cleaved fragments were detected (Additional file 2). For CLV3p12 and L-CLV3p13 we observed a gradual removal of residues from both N- and C-termini (Figure3A and B). For EEL-CLV3p15, removal of the C-terminal His residue was observed, but not N-terminal residues (Figure3C). No internal cleavages for CLV3p12, L-CLV3p13 and EEL-CLV3p15 were detected. In contrast, in addition to gradual removal of terminal residues for HEEL-CLV3p16 and LHEEL-CLV3p17, internal cleavages were also observed (Figure3D and E). In particular, for HEEL-CLV3p16, a cleavage before Thr71 was observed, producing an 11-AA peptide that is expected to be non-functional [28], while for LHEEL-CLV3p17, cleavages before Arg70 and Thr71 were detected, producing the functional CLV3p12 and a non-functional 11-AA peptide, respectively (Figure3E). As such, it is possible that the internal cleavage before Arg70 requires at least 5 flanking residues, while exopeptidases are involved in removing residues from both termini.. . Figure 3. .

CLV3 peptide with five additional N-terminal flanking residues showed similar activity as CLV3p12. To evaluate activities of above-mentioned synthetic peptides with various N-terminal extensions, we performed in vitro root assays using Ler seedlings. The lengths of primary roots were measured after 8-d inoculations with either CLV3p12, L-CLV3p13, EEL-CLV3p15, HEEL-CLV3p16 or LHEEL-CLV3p17 at concentrations of 10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM, or 1 muM (Figure4). The results showed that CLV2p12 was active at the concentration of 10 nM, EEL-CLV3p15 was active at 100 nM, while L-CLV3p13 and HEEL-CLV3p16 were not active even at 1 muM, suggesting that these additional N-terminal Leu, Glu-Glu-Leu or His-Glu-Glu-Leu residues caused severe damages to their activities, Strikingly, LHEEL-CLV3p17 was equally active as CLV3p12, i.e. functional at 10 nM. Together with the effective cleavage observed above, we believe that the additional 5 residues in LHEEL-CLV3p17 lead to effective release of CLV3p12, and hence the equivalent activity as CLV3p12.. .

Aligned sequences of all peptides are shown. The Ala substitution in the LHEEA-CLV3p17 is highlighted in red. Average root lengths with significant differences from the non-treated one (P<0.01 by Students t-test) are marked with asterisks.. . . . . . Leu69 is critical for the cleavage and activity in synthetic peptide. Previous studies suggest that PSK and RALF are produced through the cleavage after a Leu residue by endopeptidases in Arabidopsis[43,44]. To examine if the Leu69 adjacent to the N-terminus of the CLV3 peptide is involved in cleavage, we synthesized an Ala-substituted peptide, LHEEA-CLV3p17, and used MALDI-Tof MS to examine its cleavage after inoculation with seedlings in vitro. Interestingly, although removal of a C-terminal residue was observed, no internal cleavage was detected (Figure3F), suggesting that the Leu69Ala substitution had compromised the internal cleavage in the peptide. We also examined the activity of the LHEEA-CLV3p17 peptide in root assays, and observed that the substitution led to a significantly reduced activity in terminating RMs (Figure4). These results together indicate that the N-terminal flanking Leu69 is critical for the internal cleavage, and subsequently for the activity of the peptide.. . . Leu69 is important for the optimal activity of CLV3 fusion proteins. To evaluate if the Leu69 is also important for the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein, we performed an Ala substitution to produce a TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala fusion protein in E. coli. The activity of TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala in restricting the size of SAMs was examined in vitro. The results showed that SAMs in TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala-treated clv3-2 seedlings were significantly larger than those treated with TH-ProCLV3 (Figure5B, C, and E). Of course compared to non-treated clv3-2 seedlings (Figure5A) they are still smaller. It is evident that the Leu69Ala substitution in TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala has partially compromised its activity in SAMs.. . Figure 5. . In vitro SAM assays using TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala or TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys.

Error bar= SD of 3 independent biological repeats. The asterisks in E and F indicate significant differences (P<0.01 by Students t-test) between TH-ProCLV3- and TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala-treated clv3-2 seedlings.. . . . The commonly known subtilase recognition site is Lys/Arg-Arg [40]. Although in most CLE members of Arabidopsis the residue located before the conserved Arg of the 12-AA CLE motif is Lys (Additional file 3), for CLV3 the residue is Leu. We examined if a Leu69Lys substitution hampered the activity of the fusion protein. TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys was produced in E. coli and applied to clv3-2 seedlings in vitro. As expected, no significant difference was observed between the sizes of SAMs treated with TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys and those treated with TH-ProCLV3 (Figure5B, D, and E), suggesting that the Leu69Lys substitution did not affect the activity. Additionally, we performed in vitro SAM assays in clv1-1, and observed no significant differences among samples treated with TH-ProCLV3, TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala, TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys, and non-treated ones (Figure5E), implying that the functions of TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala and TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys fusion proteins in SAMs are CLV1-dependent, as the CLV3 peptide [34].. To address if these fusion proteins are able to repress the WUS expression in SAMs, qRT-PCR analyses were performed with cDNAs from shoot apices after treatments with various fusion proteins. As shown in Figure5F, the expression level of WUS in shoot apices of TH-ProCLV3-treated clv3-2 seedlings was reduced to about 10% of those non-treated ones. A similar result was obtained in clv3-2 seedlings treated with TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys (Figure5F), confirming that the Leu69Lys substitution did not impair the activity of the fusion protein. In contrast, the expression level of WUS in the TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala-treated clv3-2 seedlings was only about 50% of the untreated ones (Figure5F). The fact that replacement of Leu69 by Ala, but not by Lys, damaged the activity of CLV3 suggests that, although the Leu69 is not part of the mature CLV3 peptide, it is important for the optimal activity in repressing the WUS expression in SAMs.. . . Leu69 is critical for the cleavage of CLV3 fusion proteins. To examine if the Leu69Ala and Leu69Lys substitutions in fusion proteins, namely TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala and TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys, respectively, led to compromised cleavages, Q-Tof MS/MS analyses were performed on medium samples collected after co-cultivations of these fusion proteins with wildtype seedlings. The TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys showed a similar peptide profile as seen in the TH-ProCLV3 (Figure2 and Figure6A), producing expected CLV3p12 and CLV3p13, and peptides with a C-terminal Lys69. However, for TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala, although both the CLV3p12 and CLV3p13 were detected, no peptide fragment with C-terminal Ala69 was detected (Figure6B), suggesting that the Leu69Ala substitution may have compromised the cleavage efficiency of the fusion protein or decreased the stability of peptides produced. These results together indicate that both the Leu-Arg and Lys-Arg junctions can be recognized and cleaved by enzymes released by Arabidopsis seedlings.. . Figure 6. . Peptide fragments released from TH-CLV3Leu69Ala and TH-CLV3Leu69Lys after incubations. Fragments released from TH-CLV3Leu69Lys(A) and THCLV3Leu69Ala(B) are aligned below corresponding fusion protein sequences, as identified with Q-Tof MS/MS analyses of medium samples. Substituted AAs are in italics.. . . . . . 5-AA N-terminal flanking sequence is required for proper cleavage of CLE1. To address if the requirement of 5-AA residues in the proper cleavage of CLV3 is generic to other CLE peptides, we synthesized CLE1 peptides with either 0, 1, or 5 N-terminal flanking residues: CLE1p12, M-CLE1p13 and FNESM-CLE1p17, respectively. CLE1 was selected as it complements the clv3-1 mutant phenotype when expressed under the control of CLV3 regulatory elements in transgenic plants [35]. Within the 5-AA N-terminal flanking sequence, only the Glu (E) residue is conserved between CLV3 and CLE1 (Additional file 3). After 3-d incubation with Ler seedlings, gradual trimmings of terminal residues were observed in both CLE1p12 and M-CLE1p13, while an internal cleavage was detected between Met (M) and Arg (R) in FNESM-CLE1p17, releasing CLE1p12 (Additional file 4). This suggested that the 5-AA motif is required for proper cleavage of CLE1. As expected, when in vitro activity assays were performed in clv3-2 seedlings, FNESM-CLE1p17 exhibited a similar activity as the CLE1p12 in restricting the sizes of SAMs, while M-CLE1p13 was about 100-fold less active (Additional file 5)..
