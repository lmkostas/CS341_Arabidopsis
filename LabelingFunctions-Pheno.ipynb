    "# Tagging genes with ddlite: learning and labeling function iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this example **ddlite** app, we'll build a gene tagger from scratch. Domain-specific tagging systems take months or years to develop. They use hand-crafted model circuitry and accurate, hand-labeled training data. We'll start to build a pretty good one in a few minutes with none of those things. The generalized extraction and learning utilities provided by ddlite will allow us to turn a sampling of article abstracts and some basic domain knowledge into an automated tagging system. Specifically, we want an accurate tagger for genes in academic articles. We have comprehensive dictionaries of genes, but applying a simple matching rule might yield a lot of false positives. For example, \"p53\" might get tagged as a gene if it refers to a page number. Our goal is to use distant supervision to improve precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the pipeline we'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain and parse input data (relevant article abstracts from PubMed)\n",
    "2. Extract candidates for tagging\n",
    "3. Generate features\n",
    "4. Create a test set\n",
    "5. Write labeling functions\n",
    "6. Learn the tagging model\n",
    "7. Iterate on labeling functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts 3 through 7 are covered in this notebook. It requires candidates extracted from `GeneTaggerExample_Extraction.ipynb`, which covers parts 1 and 2."

Since our training data is not manually labeled, we'll generate many (potentially noisy) labels as a surrogate for precise, manual labels. Feature extraction and model learning are very simple in ddlite. Writing labeling functions is where the real artistry comes in. One of ddlite's goals is to enable rapid prototyping, debugging, and experimenting with labeling functions. These can be used either to create a simple standalone app, or to plug into DeepDive. Labeling functions, or LFs, are functions that take an `Candidate` object. They must return 1 (for a positive label), 0 (for abstaining), or -1 (for a negative example). For now, we'll write a few simple LFs to get started:\n",
