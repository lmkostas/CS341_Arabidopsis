Indeed, fry1, late flowering short petioles and hypocotyl hypersensitivity to red light phenotypes are largely mimicked by the xrn2 xrn3 double mutant.
Triple mutant hua27 hulk1 hulk3 plants were reduced in size with small leaves and only a few branches ( Figureb ) ; additionally these plants were entirely sterile due to pollen inviability ( green/blue coloration as observed with the Alexander stain see Figuree ) and triple mutant plants had to be derived from heterozygotes at the HUA2 locus ( i.e. hua27 / + hulk1 hulk3 plants ) .
The myb97 myb101 myb120 triple mutants exhibited the typical pollen tube overgrowth phenotype almost identical to those of fer  lre and nta mutants.
While we showed increased quercetin levels in prn1 mutant shoots in the overexpressor transformed seed lines ( WT transformed with 35S : : PRN1-GFP ) it would be expected that quercetins and perhaps flavonoids in general would be reduced from more PRN1 being present and potentially active as a quercetinase.
Disturbing mitochondrial complex I impairs energy generation and leads to the extreme retardation of diverse aspects of growth and development in mterf15 plants.
The eve1-D / + plants exhibited a loss of apical dominance late flowering and a dwarf phenotype ( at JXB online ).
However the finding that greatly reduced Rubisco within the raf1 mutant leaves had no observable effect on any other plastid-encoded proteins represents a clear difference from the effects observed in lower regions of the rlsb -1 / rlsb -2 leaves.
All reported irx8 mutant alleles are dwarf and show a collapsed xylem phenotype ( Pea et al. ; Persson et al. .
Affected genes in the rlsb -1 / rlsb -2 mutants include redox and sink-responsive light-reaction genes in BS and M cells the nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted decarboxylating NADP-ME in BS cells and the mitochondrial NAD-ME.

Likewise  gsd1  a weak allele of ACC1  which shows a clear phenotype in the warm appears to have a less severe stem wax phenotype ( based on comparison with electron microscopy images presented by ) than cold-grown sfr3 plants.
 syp22 showed multiple abnormal phenotypes including semi-dwarfism serrated wavy leaves late flowering and resistance to salt stress ( ) -LSB- -RSB-.
Indeed genetic works in Arabidopsis have identified a number of curly leaf mutants such as the incurvata ( icu ) series of mutants.
The G lignin in irx8 is significantly reduced ( Figures ) and released in the 1 M KOH extract ( Figure ) rather than in the chlorite - and PC4MKOH extracts as occurs in the WT ( Figures ) suggesting a possible correlation between the xylan reduction and lignin alteration in irx8 .
Our data showing shorter G-overhangs in Arabidopsis stn1 tert and exo1 stn1 tert mutants indicate that the long G-overhangs in STN1-deficient plants are partially derived from an impaired C-strand fill-in or aberrant processing after telomerase elongation.
The observation that the phenotype displayed by the fzl - Ler mutant partially recovered by high temperature or low light treatments was very similar to the fzl - Col phenotype suggested that the fzl - Col mutant could be seen as the mild version of the typical LMM phenotype shown by the fzl - Ler .
In this study WT Arabidopsis Columbia ( Columbia-0 ) Landsberg erecta ( Ler ) ecotype and abi4-1 were used.
