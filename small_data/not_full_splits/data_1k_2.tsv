Plant hormones are known to play important roles in adaptation to environmental stresses, including salinity, temperature fluctuations, water deficit and pathogen infection, due to their effects on growth, development and resource husbandry37. Changes in hormone levels or the ability of plants to recognize hormones such as ABA, jasmonic acid, SA, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene and auxin have all been reported to affect drought tolerance38. YUC6 overexpression increased IAA levels and drought tolerance in transgenic potato plants18. To investigate whether the drought tolerance phenotype conferred by YUC6 overexpression could be attributed to high-auxin content, we first performed experiments to corroborate that overexpression of YUC6 also increases drought tolerance in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. 1). In these experiments, 3-week-old soil-grown plants were subjected to water withdrawal for 10-14 days, and wilting symptoms in leaves were recorded periodically. Wilting symptoms were significantly greater in leaves of wild-type plants compared with leaves of previously reported YUC6 overexpression lines such as the yuc6-1D and yuc6-2D activation mutants and 35S:YUC6 transgenic plants5, whereas the loss-of-function YUC6 mutant, yuc6-3k, was more sensitive to water deficiency than the wild-type.. To investigate the connection between drought tolerance and auxin content, we subjected 3-week-old well-watered wild-type, yuc6-1D, 35S:iaaL and yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL plants to drought by withholding water for 9 days and then monitored the rate of survival 2 days after re-watering (Fig. 1a). The yuc6-1D line overproduces auxin5; the 35S:iaaL line constitutively overexpresses Pseudomonas savastanoi IAA-lysine synthase (iaaL) from the CaMV35S promoter and has phenotypes consistent with a reduction of free IAA level39; and the yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL line has been shown to have almost all the high-auxin phenotypes of yuc6-1D restored to wild-type16. Direct measurement of IAA content in these genotypes confirmed that yuc6-1D plants overproduced auxin compared with WT and 35S:iaaL, and that coexpression of 35S:iaaL cancelled auxin accumulation (Fig. 1e). That the yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL line retained morphological features resembling high-auxin effects, such as elongated petioles (Fig. 1a), suggested that developmentally regulated IAA maxima could still remain locally high and produce outputs reminiscent of high auxin, even though the overall IAA levels were similar to wild-type plants. The survival rate to drought stress of wild-type (25%) and 35S:iaaL plants (22.5%) was comparable but significantly lower than the survival rate of the YUC6 overexpression lines, yuc6-1D (45%) and yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL (50%; Fig. 1a). The ability of these plants to tolerate water deficiency was then compared by evaluating water loss from detached aerial plant parts (Fig. 1b). The yuc6-1D and yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL rosettes lost water more slowly compared with wild-type and 35S:iaaL rosettes. The rate of water loss from detached yuc6-1D and yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL rosettes was similar. These data suggest that drought tolerance phenotype achieved by YUC6 overexpression is not an inherent function of the coincidental auxin overproduction. Specific temporal and/or spatial patterns of accumulation of IAA may still occur in the yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL transgenics, in spite of the steady-state levels of IAA in these plants being even lower than that in wild type. However, it appears unlikely that the significant drought resistance observed is associated with the residual high-auxin phenotypes.. ROS, such as free radicals and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are known to accumulate under water-deficit conditions40, and we have reported that levels of ROS were lower in leaves of Arabidopsis YUC6 overexpression plants (yuc6-1D) compared with leaves of wild-type plants18. Thus, we considered the possibility that drought tolerance of the yuc6-1D mutant could be mediated by altered ROS homeostasis. Leaves of soil-grown wild-type, yuc6-1D, 35S:iaaL and yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL plants that had or had not been subjected to drought stress for 7 days were subjected to histochemical staining using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) to detect H2O2 accumulation. There was no significant increase in ROS production in yuc6-1D and yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL leaves on drought stress, whereas a significant increase in ROS production was observed in wild-type and 35S:iaaL leaves (Fig. 1c). Quantitation of short-term H2O2 production in these plants after exposure to air-drying for 4h showed that H2O2 contents in yuc6-1D and yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL plants were significantly lower than in wild-type and 35S:iaaL plants after the dehydration treatment (Fig. 1d). Collectively, these data indicate that drought tolerance of the yuc6-1D mutant correlated with the ability to limit ROS accumulation in response to drought stress but not with high-auxin content (Fig. 1a-e).. . . The yuc6-1D mutant is tolerant to oxidative stress. To test whether reduced level of ROS in YUC6-overexpressing plants under drought conditions is specific to water stress, we examined the responses of YUC6-overexpressing plants to primary oxidative stress. Methyl viologen (MV) is known to catalyse the production of ROS and promote oxidative stress in plants. Growth of wild-type plants was inhibited more than that of yuc6-1D plants on MV-containing media (Fig. 2a,b). Tissue H2O2 contents were lower in yuc6-1D plants compared with wild type even in the absence of oxidative stress (Fig. 2c), which is consistent with previous results18. MV treatment increased H2O2 levels in wild-type but not in yuc6-1D plants (Fig. 2c).. To determine whether the inhibition of ROS production by YUC6 was related to auxin metabolism, MV-induced ROS accumulation was determined in roots and leaves by histochemical staining with 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) and DAB, respectively (Fig. 2d,e). ROS accumulation was readily detected in wild-type and 35S:iaaL plants. However, ROS accumulation was not induced by MV treatment either in 35S:YUC6 leaves or in leaves and roots of yuc6-1D and yuc6-1DX35S:iaaL plants, confirming that YUC6 overexpression, but not the accompanying elevated auxin content, leads to lower ROS accumulation under oxidative stress. Furthermore, we measured H2O2 levels after exposure to MV in the loss-of-function yuc6-3k mutant, and in the auxin-deficient mutants taa1 tar2 and quadruple knockout yuc1,2,4,6. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, the increase in H2O2 levels in yuc1,2,4,6 and yuc6-3k plants was much greater than in wild-type and taa1 tar2 plants, suggesting that an unknown property of YUC proteins, separate from auxin biosynthetic activity, might be involved in ROS control under stress conditions.. . . YUC6 has a novel TR activity. YUC proteins contain an FMO domain involved in auxin biosynthesis15. There are 29 distinct Arabidopsis genes that encode proteins containing motifs typically found in FMOs, of which 11 genes belong to the YUC family15. YUC proteins share with other FMOs, counting from the N terminus, a FAD (GxGxxG)-binding- site, a FMO-identifying sequence motif (FxGxxxHxxxY/F), a NADPH (GxGxxG/A)-binding site and another sequence (F/LATGY) conserved in FMOs thought to carry out N-oxidation15.. To investigate the possibility that YUC6 carries a direct role in ROS homeostasis, we analysed YUC6 protein sequence by BLAST search to find sequence similarities in addition to the FMO-specific features. YUC6 shares weak sequence similarity (15% identity) to thioredoxin (Trx) reductases (TrxR) from bacteria (for example, E. coli TrxB) and plants (Arabidopsis NTRA and barley NTR2; Supplementary Fig. 3). The Trx systems comprise a class of small redox proteins, Trxs, which are kept in the reduced state by specific TrxR in a NADPH-dependent reaction, and they function as antioxidants, in redox regulation of protein function and in cellular signalling41. Both of FAD and NADPH are cofactors for FMOs and TrxRs and, therefore, FAD- and NADPH-binding sites are present in YUC6 and TrxR proteins42 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Fully conserved Gly residues in the FAD- and NADPH-binding sites are required for cofactor binding and FMO activity43. In addition, two conserved Gly residues in the NADPH-binding site of YUC6 (Fig. 3a) have been shown to be essential for the delayed senescence and high-auxin phenotypes of YUC6 overexpression lines of Arabidopsis16.. To follow this lead, we purified bacterially expressed maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged YUC6 and assayed for TrxR activity. In the presence of NADPH and Arabidopsis Trx h3, YUC6 (1-10muM) was able to catalyse the reduction of 5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3b, +Trx). However, YUC6 had about one-tenth the specific activity of the positive control protein, the TrxR domain of NTRC in which the C-terminal Trx domain has been deleted (NTRC-TR)44, and YUC6 also displayed TR activity in the absence of Trx h3, whereas NTRC-TR did not (Fig. 3b, - Trx). These results demonstrated TR activity by YUC6 independent of Trx. Recombinant YUC6 also had protein disulfide reductase activity with insulin and dithiothreitol (DTT; 10mM) as a substrate and a reductant, respectively (Fig. 3c). No increase in turbidity at 650nm, arising from reduction of insulin and precipitation of the free insulin B chain, was observed in the absence of YUC6. Reduction of insulin was observed at 1:0.5 or 1:1 molar ratios of insulin:recombinant YUC6. Higher proportions of YUC6 were inhibitory, indicating that at high concentrations YUC6 prevents precipitation of free insulin B chains, perhaps by forming soluble YUC6-reduced insulin complexes. This behaviour is a typical property of holdase chaperones. Indeed, an Arabidopsis Trx-like protein that has holdase chaperone activity exhibits the same behaviour as YUC6 in the insulin disulfide reductase assay45. Accordingly, recombinant YUC6 protein effectively prevented heat-induced aggregation of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), measured as an increase in turbidity at 340nm, in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that it has holdase chaperone activity (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In addition, SDS-PAGE migration analysis revealed that MDH was kept soluble by the addition of YUC6 under thermal denaturing condition at 45C, while MDH fully precipitated as aggregates in the absence of YUC6 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Collectively, these biochemical data indicate that YUC6 functions as a TR.. Most NADPH-dependent TrxRs contain a conserved CxxC motif (Supplementary Fig. 3) that is also found in the catalytic site of many redox-active proteins42. YUC6 lacks the characteristic active site CxxC motif of TrxR (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, TRs can perform reactions between their active-site cysteines and cysteines of their disulfide substrates via dithiol or monothiol mechanism43. Of the 13 Cys residues present in YUC6, only Cys-85 in the conserved motif C(E/Q)LP (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3) is fully conserved among the 11 YUC proteins of Arabidopsis, suggesting that Cys-85 might have an essential role in YUC function. To examine the role of the conserved motifs in both the TR activity domain and the oxidative decarboxylation of IPA catalysed by YUC6 that is related to auxin biosynthesis (representing YUCCA activity), we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the YUC6 cDNA (Fig. 3a). The FAD-binding site mutant (YUC6mFAD) was generated by a G41V substitution and the NADPH-binding site mutant (YUC6mNADP) was generated by G204A and G206V substitutions. Cys-85 was replaced with Ser to generate the YUC6C85S. The mutant YUC6 proteins were expressed in bacteria as MBP-tagged peptides, purified to homogeneity and assayed for TR and YUC activity in vitro (Fig. 3d,e). YUC proteins have been placed downstream of TAA1/TAR converting IPA to IAA6789, and thus we measured YUC activity using IPA as a substrate. The recombinant proteins YUC6mFAD and YUC6mNADP retained only 50% of the TR and YUC activities of the wild-type YUC6 protein, thus confirming that the FAD- and NADPH-binding sites are required for both TR and YUC activities46. However, YUC6C85S had almost the same YUC activity as wild-type YUC6 protein but, interestingly, only 20-30% of its TR activity. YUC6C85S also had considerably less holdase chaperone activity than wild-type YUC6 protein (Supplementary Fig. 4c). The identification of Cys-85 as essential for the TR- and chaperone-like activities of YUC6 but dispensable for YUC function allowed us to examine the physiological relevance of distinct biochemical activities of YUC6 separately.. . . Separate drought tolerance and high-auxin phenotypes. The synthetic DR5 promoter that consists of tandem repeats of an auxin-responsive TGTCTC element has been widely used as a reporter of auxin responses at the cellular level47. We transformed a DR5:GUS line in the wild-type Col-0 background with constructs for expressing YUC6, YUC6mFAD, YUC6mNADP, YUC6C85S, NTRA and CYTOCHROME P450 FAMILY 79 SUBFAMILY B POLYPEPTIDE 2 (CYP79B2) as YFP translational fusion proteins under the control of the CaMV35S promoter. NTRA was used as a control for high TrxR activity48, whereas CYP79B2, which encodes a cytochrome P450 that converts Trp to the IAA precursor IAOx, was used as a control for high-auxin biosynthetic activity by a pathway that is genetically distinct from the YUC route49. Transgenic lines were screened by western blot analysis, and lines with high expression of the transgene product were selected for further analyses (Fig. 4a). Among these overexpression lines (-OX), YUC6-OX displayed elongated downward curled leaves similar to yuc6-1D and other IAA-overproducing plants45, and also had strong GUS staining in leaves compared with untransformed control, indicating high-auxin content (Fig. 4b). YUC6-OXC85S and CYP79B2-OX also displayed elongated downward curled leaves and strong GUS staining in leaves indicating IAA overproduction, as expected, since YUCC85S has about the same level of YUC activity as wild-type YUC6 (Figs 3e and 4b). It was predicted that YUC6-OXmFAD and YUC6-OXmNADP plants, that overexpress catalytically inactive YUC, would have normal auxin levels. Accordingly, leaf morphology and leaf GUS stain intensity in YUC6-OXmFAD and YUC6-OXmNADP was very similar to that of untransformed and NTRA-OX plants. In agreement with the GUS-staining results, auxin contents and transcript level of the IAA-responsive gene IAA1 were similar in wild-type, YUC6-OXmFAD, YUC6-OXmNADP and NTRA-OX plants, whereas they were elevated in YUC6-OX, YUC6-OXC85S and CYP79B2-OX plants, as in yuc6-1D (ref. 5; Fig. 4c,d). These results demonstrated that FAD- and NADPH-binding sites of YUC6 were essential for auxin production. These results also showed that the TR activity of YUC6 is not required for auxin production, consistent with results showing that mutation of Cys-85 reduced TR and holdase chaperone activities of recombinant YUC6 without affecting YUC activity (Figs 3d,e and 4b-d and Supplementary Fig. 4).. Next, we examined the importance of the FAD- and NADPH-binding sites and of Cys-85 for ROS scavenging in YUC6-overexpressing plants. Untransformed, YUC6-OX, YUC6-OXmFAD, YUC6-OXmNADP, YUC6-OXC85S, CYP79B2-OX and NTRA-OX plants were treated with MV, and ROS accumulation was monitored by H2DCF-DA staining in roots and H2O2 content in aerial parts (Supplementary Fig. 5). A fluorescent signal detecting ROS was observed in roots of untransformed, YUC6-OXC85S, YUC6-OXmFAD, YUC6-OXmNADP and CYP79B2-OX plants but was barely detectable in YUC6-OX and NTRA-OX plants (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Accordingly, H2O2 contents in aerial parts of YUC6-OX and NTRA-OX plants increased only marginally on MV treatment, whereas plants expressing YUC6 mutated at Cys-85-, FAD- and NADPH-binding sites, or CYP79B2 showed significant accumulations of H2O2 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). These results indicate that auxin production was not required for the enhanced ROS-scavenging ability of YUC6 overexpressors. On the other hand, elevation of cellular TR activity protected against ROS accumulation. Intact FAD- and NADPH-binding sites and Cys-85, which were shown to contribute to TR activity of recombinant YUC6 (Fig. 3d), were also important for ROS-scavenging activity. Importantly, Cys-85 was found to be important for ROS scavenging but not auxin overproduction in vivo.. Next, we investigated the drought tolerance phenotypes of these plants by measuring survival rates of drought-treated plants after a brief re-watering period and by measuring the rate of weight loss in detached leaves that were allowed to air-dry naturally (Fig. 5a,b). We previously reported that NTRA-OX plants exhibit drought tolerance with low accumulation of ROS50. Three-week-old well-watered plants were subjected to drought by withholding water for 9 days. Irrigation was resumed and per cent survival was scored 2 days later. YUC6-OX and NTRA-OX had much better survival rates than untransformed control plants (40%, 60% for two independent YUC6-OX lines and 77.5% for the NTRA-OX line, compared with 20% for untransformed). Survival rates of untransformed (WT), YUC6-OXC85S (12.5% for two independent lines) and YUC6-OXmNADP (15%) were lower than that of YUC6-OX plants (Fig. 5a). Accordingly, reduction of water content in detached leaves was slowest in YUC6-OX, marginally faster in untransformed and still faster in YUC6-OXC85S and YUC6-OXmNADP (Fig. 5b). Histochemical staining and H2O2 contents revealed that tissue ROS content was high in drought stressed leaves of untransformed, YUC6-OXmNADP and YUC6-OXC85S plants, but much weaker in YUC6-OX and NTRA-OX (Fig. 5c,d), indicating that both, the NADPH-binding site and Cys-85, are essential for drought tolerance and low ROS content of YUC6-OX plants.. The cytochrome P450 protein CYP79B2 functions in the auxin-biosynthesis IAOx pathway that is distinct for the YUC-dependent IPA route. Overexpression of CYP79B2 induced the accumulation of auxin in plants; however, in contrast to YUC6-OX, the ROS content in CYP79B2-OX plants was increased by MV-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 4b-d and Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, we further examined whether auxin-overproducing CYP79B2-OX plants showed the output of drought stress tolerance. While YUC6-OX plants displayed drought tolerance, CYP79B2-OX plants were as sensitive as wild-type and YUC6-OXC85S plants (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The water-loss assay supported that CYP79B2-OX shoots were susceptible to dehydration compared with YUC6-OX plants (Supplementary Fig. 6b). This again indicates that auxin overproduction by the overexpression of auxin-biosynthetic pathway genes, such as YUC6 and CYP79B2, does not per se lead to drought stress tolerance, which is consistent with ROS accumulation (Figs 4 and 5 and Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).. . . Improved ROS scavenging by YUC6 overexpression. ROS-scavenging enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase are known to protect against stress-induced ROS accumulation by detoxification of ROS. Microarray analysis revealed enrichment of oxidoreductase and peroxidase transcripts in yuc6-1D compared with wild-type plants (Supplementary Table 1). Of these, only At5g59540 is weakly induced, 1.48-fold, by 3-h treatment with 1muM IAA (ref. 51). In agreement with this observation, peroxidase activity was enhanced in yuc6-1D compared with wild-type in absence of stress, whereas catalase activity was similar in both lines (Fig. 6a). By contrast, peroxidase activity in YUC6-OXC85S plants was significantly lower than in YUC6-OX plants (Fig. 6b). These results show that the TR activity of YUC6 mediates the enhanced peroxidase activity that accompanies overexpression of YUC6, perhaps by acting upstream of peroxidase expression or activity control. Expression levels of marker genes of the drought response, such as RD29A and DREB1A, were induced but not significantly different among wild-type, YUC6-OX, YUC6-OXC85S and YUC6OXmNADP plants under drought stress (Supplementary Fig. 7). Together, these results indicate the drought tolerance phenotype associated with YUC6 overexpression is predominantly mediated by the improved ROS scavenging that is associated with the TR activity of YUC6..
PMC3745560	Results. . Screening for high boron requiring mutants. Boron is an essential nutrient for plants and boron deficiency is a major cause of reduced crop production.14 Boron maintains the structure and function of the plant cell wall by cross-linking the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan (RG) II.15 Several boron transporters that are upregulated under boron limitation have been identified in A. thaliana16-18 and their polar localization and degradation through trafficking pathways in plant cells have been demonstrated.19,20 Although significant progress has been made in our understanding of boron transport mechanisms, the precise role of boron in plant growth and development remains unclear.. To obtain insight into boron function in plants, the EMS-mutagenized M2 seeds of A. thaliana were screened for mutants that required more boron than the wild type for root elongation. Approximately 20,000 seeds were sown onto normal medium (30 M B) and short-root plants were transferred to medium containing 1 mM boron after 7 d. After growth on high boron medium for 7 d, plants that exhibited increased root elongation at 1 mM boron were selected. From this screening, we isolated 13 mutants. We named one of these mutants b26-6/ctr1-16, as it is allelic to the ctr1 mutants described later (Fig.1A).. . . Figure1. Identification and characterization of the b26-6/ctr1-16 mutants.

Rough mapping. The b26-6/ctr1-16 mutant in the Col-0 background was crossed with Ler wild-type plants for rough mapping. The F2 population segregated into wild type and mutant type at a ratio of 3:1, indicating that the mutant phenotype is caused by a single recessive mutation. Genomic DNA was isolated from 12 F2 plants that exhibited the mutant phenotype and the mutation was assigned to a chromosome using simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers F15A17 and T32M21. A candidate region with the mutation was rough mapped to between 0.70 Mb and 1.26 Mb on chromosome 5, a region that spanned 175 putative genes annotated in TAIR9 (Fig.1B and Table 2).. . . Table2.

To identify point mutations, we sequenced the genomic DNA of the b26-6/ctr1-16 mutant by SOLiD. We constructed sequence libraries from the b26-6/ctr1-16 mutant and seven other mutants derived from Lehle Seeds using the SOLiD barcoding system to distinguish the eight samples (Fig.2). The 8-plex libraries were sequenced on a single SOLiD slide. In total, 378.4 M reads were obtained, of which 58.4 M were assigned to the b26-6/ctr1-16 mutant library (see Table 1 for details). Of all the b26-6/ctr1-16 mutant library reads, 73.2% were mapped to the TAIR9 release of the A. thaliana Col-0 genome. The median value of per-base sequence depth was 10 and the genome coverage was 91.8% (Table 1 and Fig. S1).. . . Figure2. Scheme of the method used to identify mutations described in this manuscript. This method is based on a combination of two approaches: low- (< 5  per site per individual, on average) or medium- (5-20  ) coverage sequencing13 by SOLiD and classical genetic rough mapping. Sharing a slide of barcoded genomic DNA obtained from many mutants (i.e., low-coverage sequencing by multiplex SOLiD sequencing) made it possible to reduce the cost per sample.

We used diBayes for SNP calling with a low stringency setting. Although this setting may increase the risk of reporting false positives, considering that the sequence depth was relatively low (median = 10), we chose this aggressive but sensitive SNP calling strategy to avoid overlooking true SNPs of low sequence coverage. With this strategy, the diBayes program listed 2162 homozygous SNP sites (Table 2).. We assessed the pattern of genome-wide SNPs by plotting the SNP frequencies using a bin size of 1 Mb (Fig. S2A). Almost all SNPs were distributed evenly throughout the genome at an average of 18 SNPs per 1 Mb, with a few regions being enriched in SNPs. This SNP enrichment may be due to variations that were already present in the parental line, rather than to an EMS mutagenesis bias, as a substantial number of SNPs were shared in these regions among eight Lehle Seeds libraries sequenced in this experiment (Fig. S2B). By subtracting shared SNPs, which were regarded as background, the number of SNPs was reduced to 2046. We then extracted SNPs that involved G-to-A (or complementary C-to-T) nucleotide substitutions, which are typical of EMS mutagenesis,21,22 and obtained 462 SNPs. We classified the SNPs according to gene models: 179 occurred in exons and 0 in splice donor/acceptor sites. In total, 177 genes were found to be mutagenized in the genome of the b26-6/ctr1-16 mutant. The b26-6/ctr1-16 mutant was isolated from Lehle Seeds, which are widely used by Arabidopsis researchers. Based on this experiment and additional unpublished ones (Kamiya T and Fujiwara T, unpublished data), an average of 450 mutations was found to exist in the genomes of the Lehle Seeds mutants, approximately 200 mutations of which were exonic. This information can be used in the design of experiments to isolate A. thaliana mutants.. Our re-sequencing method detected three SNPs within the 0.56-Mb candidate genomic region on chromosome 5, which was narrowed down by genetic rough mapping and found to contain 175 genes (Fig.1B). Two of the three mutations resulted in non-synonymous amino acid changes (Table 3).. . . Table3. Mutations that result in amino acid substitutions in the mapped region. .

Genome re-sequencing by SOLiD identified three candidate SNPs for the b26-6/ctr1-16 mutant in the region narrowed down by rough mapping. Two of the three mutations resulted in an amino acid substitution in At5g02990 and At5g03730, respectively. At5g03730 is annotated as CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1),23 and the root phenotype of ctr1 mutants, especially an abundance of hairy roots, was quite similar to that of the mutant identified in this study, b26-6/ctr1-16.24,25. b26-6/ctr1-16 has a point mutation that changes the 610th codon from CTT to TTT, which results in an amino acid substitution of Leu to Phe. Leu610 is highly conserved among species and localizes to the kinase domain of CTR1.. To show that CTR1 is the causal gene of b26-6/ctr1-16, the boron response of two ctr1 alleles, ctr1-1 and sis1/ctr1-12, was examined (Fig.1A).23,25 Both alleles displayed a similar phenotype to b26-6/ctr1-16 under normal growth conditions and, like b26-6/ctr1-16, root elongation was restored to normal rates by treatment with 1 mM boron. These results indicate that the causal gene of b26-6/ctr1-16 is indeed CTR1..

Potyviruses for which 4E-based resistances have been reported both in a crop and in Arabidopsis were considered (Table1). To check that the 4E proteins involved in susceptibility to potyviruses were assigned to the correct isoform group, phylogenies based on their protein sequences were built.

Amino acids identical or similar among at least 3 sequences are highlighted in black and grey, respectively. Amino acids common only to either eIF4E1 or eIFiso4E sequences are highlighted in blue and green, respectively. Isoform-specific amino acids as defined by Monzingo et al. [23] are marked by an asterisk. eIF4E1 box I and II, marked in red, are clusters of natural variation involved in resistance to potyviruses, as defined by Robaglia and Caranta [3].. . . . We focussed on plant susceptibility to the TEV HAT strain, which involves eIF4E1 in pepper and eIFiso4E in Arabidopsis. The sequences of eIF4E1 and eIFiso4E proteins from pepper and Arabidopsis were aligned to see whether sequence homologies between Ca.eIF4E1 and At.eIFiso4E could explain why the TEV uses different isoforms depending on the host (Figure1B). However, the Ca.eIF4E1 protein is much more similar to At.eIF4E1 than to At.eIFiso4E (identity 63.8% and 42.9%, respectively). Overall sequence homologies and the signature residues previously identified [23] both confirm that Ca.eIF4E1 and At.eIF4E1 on one hand and Ca.eIFiso4E and At.eIFiso4E on the other hand are assigned to the correct isoform group. In total, 48 AA are specific to eIF4E1 sequences and 41 AA to eIFiso4E sequences. Among these specific residues, 23 were mutually exclusive. Furthermore, the analysis of several resistant alleles in crops has made it possible to delimit regions I and II in the eIF4E1 protein sequence where AA substitutions involved in resistance to potyviruses tend to cluster [3]. It is possible to delimit region I and II in eIFiso4E because three-dimensional models suggest that eIF4E1 and eIFiso4E adopt a similar structure [24,25]. A higher degree of similarity was expected in regions I and II between Ca.eIF4E1 and At.eIFiso4E, but regions I and II are in fact much more conserved between At.eIF4E1 and Ca.eIF4E1 and between At.eIFiso4e and Ca.eIFIso4E, respectively (Figure1B). Overall then, protein sequence analyses do not explain why TEV HAT relies on different isoforms to infect Arabidopsis and pepper respectively.. In pepper and in Arabidopsis, physical interaction of eIF4E or eIFiso4E with the potyviral VPg has been shown to correlate with the host susceptibility to the virus. We tested in yeast-two hybrid assays whether differential interaction between 4E initiation factors and the TEV VPg might be responsible for the different isoform requirement between Arabidopsis and pepper (Figure2). As previously reported, we found that the TEV HAT VPg strongly interacts with the susceptible Ca.eIF4E1-pvr2+ protein but not with the resistant Ca.eIF4E1-pvr22 [17]. This differential interaction is restricted to Ca.eIF4E1 proteins as the TEV HAT VPg does not interact with the pepper Ca.eIFiso4E protein. TEV HAT VPg did not interact with either At.eIF4E1 or with At.eIFiso4E, although genetic studies have shown that At.eIFiso4E is required for Arabidopsis infection by TEV [6,7,26]. One explanation is that in some species the plant specificity depends on additional factors in planta that modulate the interaction between the viral proteins and the 4E initiation factor. Alternatively, additional factors may impair eIF4E1 recruitment by the virus in Arabidopsis.. . Figure 2. . Arabidopsis TEV-susceptibility protein AteIFiso4E does not interact with TEV VPg in yeast two-hybrid assays. Yeast transformed with both bait (fused to the Gal4 binding domain, BD) and prey (fused to the Gal4 activation domain, AD) vectors were spotted on selective dropout medium without leucine and tryptophan (SD-LW) as a control and on selective dropout without leucine, tryptophan and histidine (SD-LWH) to check for interaction between both partners. In each case, a control with an empty vector (-) was included to confirm there was no self-activation. All combinations are shown in triplicate.. . . . . . Setting up a TEV-complementation system in Arabidopsis. If additional factors affect the interaction of TEV with eIF4E isoforms and are involved in host specificity, expression of a susceptible Ca.eIF4E1 in a TEV-resistant Arabidopsis background should not restore susceptibility. We aimed to test whether a pepper eIF4E1 could complement an Arabidopsis line lacking its endogenous At.eIFiso4E and hence resistant to TEV. However, in the Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia accession, the resistance to TEV triggered by the eifiso4e mutation is masked by the presence of RTM1, a natural dominant resistance gene that represses the systemic spread of most TEV virus strains including TEV-HAT [27,28]. To circumvent the masking effect of RTM1 resistance, the Columbia eifiso4e line was crossed to Landsberg erecta (Ler), which carries a defective rtm1 allele. Homozygous eifiso4e rtm1 double mutants were selected in the F2 population. These plants were allowed to self-fertilise and the TEV susceptibility of the resultant F3 plants was assessed. Columbia (eIFiso4E/eIFiso4E; RTM1/RTM1), Ler (eIFiso4E/eIFiso4E; rtm1/rtm1) and the F3 eifiso4e rtm1 double mutants (eifiso4e/eifiso4e; rtm1/rtm1) were challenged with TEV HAT or CAA10. Plant susceptibility was assessed by testing viral gene expression and viral protein expression to check for systemic infection by either virus (Figure3). As previously reported [28], TEV HAT could systemically infect the Ler accession but not Columbia. The eifiso4e rtm1 plants were resistant to TEV HAT suggesting that the eifiso4e KO allele is an effective and complete resistance allele to TEV HAT [6]. The TEV CAA10 strain, which overcomes the resistance of the Ca.eIF4E- pvr22 allele in pepper, was unable to infect either Col or Ler (Figure3), suggesting incompatibility or that some other form of resistance is at work.. . Figure 3. . The rtm1 eifiso4e double mutant is resistant to TEV HAT and TEV CAA10 does not infect Arabidopsis thaliana Ler or Col accessions. One-month-old Arabidopsis were manually inoculated with TEV HAT or CAA10 strains and assayed at 24 dpi. Wild type accessions Columbia (eIFiso4E/eIFiso4E; RTM1/RTM1) and Landsberg erecta (eIFiso4E/eIFiso4E; rtm1/rtm1) were compared to the double mutant eifiso4e/eifiso4e; rtm1/rtm1. Nicotiana tabacum cv Xanthi non-inoculated (mock) or inoculated (Inoc) plants were included as controls. A, Plants were assayed for viral coat protein accumulation by ELISA at 24 dpi. Mean values for 6 independent plants per genotype are shown and error bars represent standard errors. The horizontal black line is the susceptibility threshold. B, RT-PCR expression of the TEV VPg gene in systemic leaf tissues. APT1 is amplified as a constitutive control in Arabidopsis plants.. . . . To validate the complementation system, the At.eIFiso4E cDNA was overexpressed in the eifiso4e rtm1 mutant. As At.eIFiso4E mRNA is normally ubiquitously expressed in all Arabidopsis tissues, its cDNA was cloned under the control of a 35SCaMV promoter in a binary vector and transformed into eifiso4e rtm1 plants. As a negative control, a 35S:GUS construct, expressing the reporter gene uidA, was transformed in the same background (Figure4A).. . Figure 4. . Homologous complementation of eifiso4e rtm1 by AteIFiso4E overexpression restores susceptibility to TuMV and TEV HAT. A, Schematic representations of the T-DNA constructs inserted in eifiso4e rtm1 Arabidopsis plants. B, One-month-old Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with the TuMV CDN1 strain and assayed for viral coat protein accumulation by DAS-ELISA at 24 dpi. One T2 line transformed with the 35S:GUS construct was tested and five independent T2 lines transformed with 35S:AteIFiso4E. C, Western blot analysis of eIFiso4E protein levels in total proteins extracted from 1-month-old leaves. Actin protein levels were assessed as a loading control. D, One-month-old Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with TEV-HAT and assayed for viral coat protein accumulation by ELISA at 24 dpi.. . . . Transgenic plants were first challenged with TuMV CDN1, because the eifiso4e KO allele has been described as being resistant to this viral strain [6,20], (Figure4B). Four out of the five independent 35S:At.eIFiso4E T2 lines tested showed complete susceptibility to TuMV (Figure4B), showing successful complementation of the eifiso4e mutation by overexpressing At.eIFiso4E. In parallel, At.eIFiso4E protein levels were assessed in plant extracts by western blot using a specific polyclonal serum (Figure4C). A specific band of the expected 21kDa size was detected in wild-type Col and Ler plant extracts but was absent in extracts from eifiso4e rtm1 plants. The four transgenic lines that were susceptible to TuMV were found to accumulate high levels of eIFiso4E. Significantly, expression of the eIFiso4E transgene was not detected in line 08, which remained resistant to TuMV CDN1.. Three of the independent 35S:AteIFiso4E lines showing a high level of susceptibility to TuMV were challenged with TEV HAT and were found to be highly susceptible (Figure4D). These results validated the efficiency of the TEV-susceptibility complementation system.. . . Heterologous Ca.eIF4E1 expression in Arabidopsis restores susceptibility to TEV HAT. In order to test whether pepper eIF4E alleles can complement the susceptibility to TEV in Arabidopsis, the full length cDNA encoding Ca.eIF4E1-pvr2+ and Ca.eIF4E1-pvr22 were cloned into a binary vector and transformed into eifiso4e rtm1 Arabidopsis plants (Figure5A). When challenged with TEV HAT, five T2 lines out of six that overexpressed the Ca.eIF4E1-pvr2+ susceptibility allele accumulated a high level of viral coat protein in systemic tissues, so were highly susceptible to this strain (Figure5B and data not shown). The pepper eIF4E1 encoded by the pvr2+ allele can therefore be used by TEV HAT in Arabidopsis instead of its heterolog isoform AteIFiso4E. In comparison, the overexpression of the Ca.eIF4E1-pvr22 allele in the same eifiso4e rtm1 background did not restore susceptibility to TEV HAT in any of the 6 independent lines tested (Figure5B and data not shown). To ensure that those phenotypes were not due to differences in transgene expression, the levels of Ca.eIF4E1 mRNA in plant leaves were analysed by RT-PCR (Figure5C). Similar large amounts of Ca.eIF4E1 mRNA accumulated in all the lines tested. Even when the Ca.eIF4E1 pvr22 allele is highly expressed in eifiso4e rtm1 plants, susceptibility to TEV HAT is not restored. Overall, these data show that in Arabidopsis, the TEV HAT uses the Ca.eIF4E1-pvr2+ susceptible allele instead of the At.eIFiso4E, so is able to swap its 4E isoform requirement within the same host. The susceptibility to TEV could not be restored by the pvr22 eIF4E1 resistant allele. Hence this TEV-susceptibility complementation system is allele specific.. . Figure 5. . Heterologous complementation of eifiso4e rtm1 with Capsicum annuum eIF4E1 alleles trigger susceptibility to TEV HAT in an allele-specific manner. A, Schematic representations of the T-DNA constructs inserted in eifiso4e rtm1 Arabidopsis plants. B, One- month-old Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with TEV HAT and assayed for viral coat protein accumulation by ELISA at 24 dpi. Results are shown on three independent T2 lines per construct. C, RT-PCR on total mRNA extracted from 1-month-old plants show that the Ca.eIF4E mRNA is expressed at similar levels in eifiso4e rtm1 plants transformed with T-DNA harbouring a 35S:Ca.eIF4E-pvr2+ or 35S:Ca.eIF4E1-pvr22 construct. The reference gene APT1 is amplified as a control.. . . . . . Complementation of Arabidopsis with heterologous Ca.eIF4E1 generates loss of incompatibility to TEV CAA10. Neither Columbia nor Ler Arabidopsis plants are susceptible to the TEV CAA10 strain. The iso4e rtm1 plants transformed with 35S:At.eIFiso4E constructs were challenged with TEV CAA10 but overexpression of At.eIFiso4E was not sufficient to trigger susceptibility in Arabidopsis (Figure6). If this lack of susceptibility is linked to an active resistance, we would expect this mechanism to remain functional in the transgenic plants expressing Ca.eIF4E1 alleles and the plants would remain resistant. On the contrary, if the resistance relies on an incompatibility mechanism, this resistance might be alleviated by overexpressing an eIF4E1 allele demonstrated to be required by TEV CAA10 in pepper. To test this, the Arabidopsis T2 lines expressing the pepper eIF4E1 alleles were challenged with TEV CAA10. Transgenic T2 plants overexpressing either Ca.eIF4E1-pvr2+ or Ca.eIF4E1-pvr22 cDNAs were highly susceptible to TEV CAA10 (Figure6). Therefore, expression of a heterologous susceptibility host factor is sufficient to create susceptibility in an otherwise incompatible accession. Interestingly, the transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing Ca.eIF4E1-pvr22 were resistant to TEV HAT but susceptible to TEV CAA10, mirroring precisely the resistance-breaking effect observed in the pepper/TEV pathosystem.. . Figure 6. . Heterologous complementation of eifiso4e rtm1 with Capsicum annum eIF4E1 alleles suppresses incompatibility to TEV CAA10. One-month-old Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with TEV CAA10 strain and assayed for viral coat protein accumulation by ELISA at 24 dpi. Three independent lines were tested for each construct..
PMC5368169	Results. . Curation of the Arabidopsis RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase protein sequences. To re-confirm the published RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase proteins encoded in Arabidopsis genome the 27,667 Arabidopsis proteins from the latest genome annotation release (ARA11) were scanned for RING domains. Through filtering the signatures in Gene3D, SUPERFAMILY, ProSiteProfiles, SMART, Pfam, ProSitePatterns altogether 509 putative RING domain containing protein sequences were obtained (Supplemental Table 2). RING gene names and descriptions were obtained from Araport using Thalemine tool (Supplemental Table 2). Araport used curated but also automatic gene annotation, therefore many RING domain containing proteins were annotated as RING/U-box protein although they did not contain U-box domain. Similarly, some were annotated as RING/FYVE/PHD zinc finger superfamily proteins. The 509 RING sequences were compared to the previously described RING-type protein sequences (Kosarev et al., 2002; Stone et al., 2005). From the 509 identified RING domain proteins 457 matched with the 490 previously described, thus resulting in 31 non-matching sequences (Figure 2). These non-matching sequences were thoroughly analyzed and, 6 of them were found to be merged with other gene models, 10 had no RING domain, 3 were not found in the database, 3 corresponded to pseudogenes, 7 were split and a new locus identifier had been assigned for them, and 2 were transposable elements (Supplemental Table 3A). The 50 additionally identified RING domain proteins were shown to represent diverse RING domains such as, 1 of D type, 4 of C2 type, 20 of H2, 16 of HC, 2 of S/T, and 7 of V (CH) type, according to the Stone et al. (2005) classification (Supplemental Table 2).. . Figure 2. . RING gene family of 509 as identified by: this study (Kosarev et al., 2002; Stone et al., 2005). This study brought in 50 new RING genes and 31 from the earlier studies were excluded.. . . . . . Differential gene expression data identifies 122 flower related RING ubiquitin E3 ligases. To associate the RING domain proteins with flowering or flower development two approaches were followed: (1) identifying those with gene expression enhanced or enriched during flower development or in flower organs, and (2) by searching RING proteins interacting with known flower regulators. For the first approach Genevestigator (Hruz et al., 2008) tool was used to rank differentially expressed genes (DEG) of the identified RING genes over Arabidopsis developmental stages and in flower organs relative to their expression in developed rosette (Figures 3A,B). In the selected experiments in Genevestigator database, probes were available for 393 of the 509 RING E3 ligases analyzed. The cut off for DEGs was set at 2-fold to be included in the selection resulting in lists of genes of interest for each of the categories. This process was repeated to identify gene expression enrichment at each of the development stages of bolting, young flower, developed flower, and flower and siliques. For the developmental categories altogether 71 DEGs were identified (Figure 3C). In addition to the developmental stages, enrichment for shoot apical meristem, sepal, petal, stamen and pistil organs were retrieved and resulted in 109 DEGs (Figure 3D). Some of the RING genes were common between these two categories and in total 122 unique RING genes were up-regulated in the flower related processes. The gene identifying AGI codes of these 122 flower related candidates are provided in the Supplemental Table 3B.. . Figure 3. . (A) Differential expression profiles of developmental stage enriched RING genes relative to developed rosette. (B) Differential expression profiles of flower organ enriched RING genes relative to rosette; SAM, Shoot apical meristem. (C) Venn diagram of RING genes expressed in the different developmental stages (B, bolting; YF, Young flower; DF, Developed flower; FS, Flowers and siliques). (D) Venn diagram of RING genes expressed in the different flower organs; SAM, Shoot apical meristem; SP, Sepal; PT, Petal; ST, stamen; PS, pistil.. . . . For the second approach we identified 6 additional genes of interest through literature study and from interaction networks of CO, COP1, and TOE2 from BioGRID (http://thebiogrid.org/). Based on these interaction screens 5 RING E3 ligases were selected to the study, represented by the following mutant lines; N656705 (AT5G65683), N686069 (AT1G61620), N372291 (AT3G29270), N2037522 and N67002 (AT4G17680), and N742646 (AT2G44410). In addition, a mutant line for COP1, cop1-6, and RED AND FAR-RED INSENSITIVE 2 (RFI2) for which a role in mediating red and far-red light signaling and ubiquitination activity has been shown in vitro, were included (Stone et al., 2005; Chen and Ni, 2006a). This E3 ligase was selected as a candidate since its expression is regulated by circadian clock and rfi2-1 mutant flowers early (Chen and Ni, 2006b). Thus, one mutant allele for RFI2 (N878610) was included in the study. Mutants representing these genes were analyzed together with the flower up-regulated RINGs and were named flower related UPS candidates in the Supplemental Table 1.. . . Representative mutant collection. For functional characterization of the 122 flower related UPS candidates and those selected based on literature, a mutant collection was obtained from the NASC stock center. The mutants represented lines from CATMA, SAIL, SALK, and GABI-Kat collections (Alonso et al., 2003; Rosso et al., 2003; Schmid et al., 2005; Kleinboelting et al., 2012). Altogether 43 lines were shown to contain T-DNA insertion in one locus, six were doubtful and were omitted from the analysis. To confirm that the T-DNA insertion had interrupted the gene of interest, their altered expression levels were confirmed by qPCR analysis with primers listed in Supplemental Table 1. For 43 accessions representing 30 unique loci from the 122 flower related UPS candidates and the selected candidates a differential gene expression pattern was analyzed. Altogether 19 lines were knock-outs, and 13 knock-down mutants, and for 10 lines up-regulation of the gene of interested was observed (Supplemental Table 1). For one line, no differential expression was confirmed and this was excluded from the phenotyping. For 14 lines alleles were available with similar or opposite gene expression patterns.. . . Phenotypic screen of the mutant accessions. From the genotypically and qPCR confirmed T-DNA insertion mutant lines, 43 were subjected to phenotypic characterization by top view RGB imaging using the PlantScreen system. Image series of each analyzed line were collected daily allowing analyzing the growth and changes in morphology over time. For scoring those lines showing phenotypes, we fitted general additive models (GAM) to each parameter of each analyzed lines (data not shown). Most of the lines showed no differences to their corresponding Col-0 controls. However, three lines were consistently different across the experiments compared to Col-0 in both growth and rosette morphology: csu1-4 (cop1 suppressor 1-4, N686069), sinal7-2 (seven in absentia like 7-2, N833574) (Peralta et al., 2016) and rha1a-1 (ring-h2 finger a1a-1, N2045046) (Table 1, Supplemental Tables 1, 4). The csu1-4 mutant rosette was clearly smaller than Col-0 and showed a yellowish coloration (Figure 4). The mutant line rha1a-1 seemed to have smaller leaves than Col-0, however, at the end of growth it appeared to have more leaves that resulted in similar final rosette area as compared to Col-0. This line also had shorter petioles and leaf serration. The third line sinal7-2 rosette was clearly larger than Col-0 but did not show major differences in color, shape or number of leaves (Figure 4).. . Table 1. .

Representative rosette images are shown from days 10 to 20 after stratification. DAS, days after stratification.. . . . To further analyze these three lines, mixed non-linear models were fitted to their data using several order polynomials for parametric analysis of the models. This analysis confirmed the earlier observations of significant changes in growth and development for these lines over time (Table 1). Line csu1-4 showed slower growth, reduced rosette area and perimeter compared to Col-0 along the complete measured period (Figures 5A,D). For line rha1a-1 the rosette area was very similar to Col-0 being, however, slightly but significantly larger over time probably due to its higher number of leaves (Figure 5B, Table 1). Although the differences between rha1a-1 and Col-0 were small the statistical model was able to capture those. Conversely, sinal7-2 showed both area and perimeter larger than Col-0 indicating more vigorous growth (Figures 5C,F).. . Figure 5. . Growth measurements from day 10 to 20.

DAS, days after stratification.. . . . . . Circularity parameters. Morphological data for parameters of circularity that include roundness, roundness 2 and isotropy were also evaluated for these lines (Figure 1). Line csu1-4 showed increased roundness over the total period analyzed in comparison to Col-0 (Figures 6A-C, Table 1). However, csu1-4 roundness curve had similar pattern to Col-0 but shifted to the right (Figure 6A). Similar situation was observed for sinal7-2, where the roundness curve shape was almost identical to Col-0 but in this case was shifted to the left, showing lower roundness along the total time period (Figure 6C, Table 1). Roundness curve of rha1a-1 was neither shifted nor similar to Col-0 curve. This line showed a lower roundness than Col-0 at the beginning of the analysis, reaching a stabilization point around 16 DAS (Table 1). For Col-0 plants roundness continued decreasing until it become lower than rha1a-1 (Figure 6B).. . Figure 6. . Circularity measurements from day 10 to 20.

DAS, days after stratification.. . . . Line csu1-4 showed a similar roundness 2 pattern as Col-0 that is shifted to the right by approximately 2 days (Figures 6D-F). Line rha1a-1, showed an oscillating pattern too, however, its roundness 2 values were constantly close to 0.9 with less steep peaks than Col-0, presenting the highest differences between days 12 and 16 (Figure 6E, Table 1). Similarly, to line csu1-4, line sinal7-2 presented an oscillating pattern very similar to Col-0, however, this time the curve had shifted to the left by approximately 1 day (Figure 6F).. Isotropy showed similar results as roundness and roundness 2, where line csu1-4 and sinal7-2 had similar oscillating pattern as Col-0, but csu1-4 curve is shifted to the right, while the curve for sinal7-2 is shifted to the left (Figures 6G-I). Line rha1a-1 showed a constant high isotropy value decreasing over time until reaching Col-0 pattern by day 23 (Figure 6H, Table 1).. . . Symmetry parameters. The morphological parameters describing symmetry were eccentricity and rotational mass symmetry (RMS) (Figure 1). For eccentricity, line csu1-4 showed a similar pattern as Col-0 plants with a large and a small eccentricity peak, but shifted to the right (Figure 7A). Line rha1a-1 presented no shift in its curve, but it showed a rather flat peak around days 11 and 15, remaining lower than Col-0 until the end of the analysis (Figure 7B, Table 1). This result shows that rha1a-1 is less eccentric than Col-0 along the complete analysis. Line sinal7-2 showed also a similar pattern to Col-0 plants with two eccentric peaks, but slightly shifted to the left (Figure 7C). For RMS line csu1-4 showed similar pattern as Col-0 plants, but shifted again to the right about 1 day for the highest peak and remained higher than Col-0 in the last days of the analysis (Figure 7D). On the other hand, rha1a-1 presented no shift in its curve, but it showed a decrease in the peak around days 11 and 15, decaying faster and remaining lower than Col-0 plants (Figure 7E, Table 1). Like in eccentricity, sinal7-2 was almost indistinguishable from the Col-0 plants, except for a slight shift to the left captured by the model (Figure 7F).. . Figure 7. .

DAS, days after stratification.. . . . . . Center distance parameters. The last two morphological parameters analyzed were compactness and slenderness of the leaves (SOL), which were based on the center distance (Figure 1). Here line csu1-4 showed a decay of compactness overtime in a similar way to Col-0 plants, but its curve was shifted to the right (Figure 8A). Lines csu1-4 and sinal7-2 presented quite normal compactness curves, while for rha1a-1 the pattern that was less compact than Col-0 plants at the beginning of the analyzed period (Figure 8B, Table 1). The compactness later rises above Col-0, showing higher compactness values. Like for the previously described parameters, sinal7-2 compactness curve showed slightly lower values than Col-0, except for the last 2 days where Col-0 plants reached sinal7-2 compactness (Figure 8C).. .

DAS, days after stratification.. . . . Line csu1-4 showed lower SOL values than Col-0, while rha1a-1 and sinal7-2 showed higher SOL values than Col-0 (Figures 8E,F, Table 1). The main differences in SOL could be observed during the exponential growing phase of the rosette and reaching a plateau at the end of the analyzed period where the differences to Col-0 plants become insignificant (Figures 8D-F).. . . Flowering time phenotypes. Flowering time mutants identified in the screen represented both with reduced and increased leaf numbers at bolting (Table 2). Line csu1-4 (AT1G61620) was clearly early-flowering in both experimental replications. AT5G63970, a putative forkhead box protein, mutant line was early flowering in one of two experimental replications. SBP (S-ribonuclease binding protein) family protein (AT4G17680) was late flowering in both experimental replications. As already shown by others, cop1-6 mutant was early flowering in both LAB (7) and DTB (22). In most of the mutant lines, LAB did not differ from Col-0 in all experimental replications, but the trend was observed in both or all. LAB or DTB of sinal7-2 did not differ from Col-0 in either of the experimental replications.. . Table 2. .

Mutation in SINAL7 causes flower growth phenotypes. Flower morphology of the analyzed mutants was observed under stereomicroscope. The mutant line sinal7-2 was found to produce flower buds of abnormal shape, characterized by presence of cavities in the bud tips (Figures 9A,B). These openings were present at one or both sides of the affected buds and were caused by tips of the lateral sepals bending inwards (Figures 9E,F). Also medial sepals frequently showed altered morphology: their tips covered the buds to a lesser extent than in Columbia, resulting in their blunt appearance. Whereas these phenotypes were present in all 18 analyzed inflorescences of sinal7-2 plants, regardless of the plant age-only two out of 13 analyzed wild type inflorescences showed similar sepal features, restricted to the first six flowers on the main stems. Scoring flowers stage late 12-15 (located between positions 1st and 20th on the main inflorescences) revealed that in 54% of the mutant flowers (43/80) at least one lateral sepal tip was bent inwards-as compared to 6/50, i.e., 12% in Col-0 (the analyzed flowers came from 13 to 9 individual plants, respectively).. .

Dissecting flower buds at the end of stage 12 revealed that the occurrence of ingrown lateral sepal tips was accompanied by petal wrinkling, as the sepal shape interfered with elongation of the petals (Figures 9G,H). Indeed, in some of the mature flowers with bent lateral sepal tips, the petal blades remained wrinkled; in several cases also pistil or stamen shape was affected (Figures 9C,D,I,J).. SINAL7 has been shown to mediate ubiquitination of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GAPC1) enzyme in vitro and to affect its enzymatic activity and subcellular localization in Arabidopsis (Peralta et al., 2016). In plants lacking GAPC1 male sterility was observed (Rius et al., 2008). To investigate whether deficiency of SINAL7 impairs male fertility in the sinal7-2 mutant, pollen viability was inspected according to the modified Alexander method (Peterson et al., 2010). Anthers of 12 mutant and 11 Col-0 flowers in the developmental stages late 12 and 13 were stained (early and late flowers, originating from at least five individual plants per line). However, no difference between the mutant and Col-0 pollen was observed: anthers of both lines contained almost exclusively viable pollen grains (Figures 9K,L)..
PMC3338764	Results. . Phylogenetic Analysis of AtNMD3. To systematically analyze the function of AtNMD3, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method with 36 representative species, including 28 photosynthetic organisms (Figure 1). The result indicated that the NMD3 homolog is widely present in photosynthetic organisms. The sequence comparison showed that within the 516 amino acid AtNMD3, its N terminal sequence (1-150 aa) is highly conserved with its homologs in other species (Figure S1). Further analysis of AtNMD3 showed that this protein contains both leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES, 453-472 aa and 481-500 aa) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS, 396-428 aa. Figure S3). Together, this sequence information suggested that AtNMD3 may have a function in the nuclear export of the 60S ribosomal subunit similar to that of other NMD3(s) reported in yeast and vertebrate cells.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0035904.g001. Figure 1. . Unrooted phylogenetic analysis of the NMD3 family..

AtNMD3 Proteins Shuttle between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm. To test whether the AtNMD3 protein functions in the export of 60S ribosomal subunits from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, protoplasts were prepared and transiently transformed with constructs expressing EGFP fusions of AtNMD3 (35S::EGFP-AtNMD3), AtNMD3 without the C-terminal sequence containing the two predicted NESs (35S::EGFP-AtNMD3deltaNES) and AtNMD3 lacking both the NES and NLS (35S::EGFP-AtNMD3deltaNLSdeltaNES. Figure S4). We found that the full-length AtNMD3 fusion protein could localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 2A), while the AtNMD3 fusion protein without the NESs could only be detected in the nucleus and not in the cytoplasm (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the distribution of the AtNMD3 fusion protein without both the NES and NLS showed a punctuated distribution pattern (Figure 2C), the reason for which needs to be further investigated.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0035904.g002. Figure 2. . AtNMD3 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and is inhibited by LMB.. A to C show the localization of EGFP labeled AtNMD3, AtNMD3deltaNES and AtNMD3deltaNLSdeltaNES in transformed protoplasts, respectively. AtNMD3 was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (A), AtNMD3deltaNES was centralized in the nucleus (B), and AtNMD3deltaNLSdeltaNES was distributed in a puntate pattern (C). D to G show the effects of LMB on AtNMD3 localization. As a positive control, EGFP labeled XPO1/CRM1 was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (D), but the signals could only be detected in the nucleus after LMB treatment (E). LMB changed the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of AtNMD3 (F), restricting it to the nucleus (G). H and I show that the EGFP distribution was not affected by LMB treatment.. . . . According to the current model, the nuclear export of 60S ribosomal subunits by NMD3 requires formation of a protein complex with XPO1/CRM1 [19]. It has been reported that Arabidopsis XPO1/CRM1, similar to those found in yeast and human, is involved in the nuclear export of proteins, and this function is inhibited by the cytotoxin leptomycin (LMB) [20]. If AtNMD3 indeed has an adaptor function for nuclear export of the 60S ribosomal subunit similar to that found in yeast and vertebrate cells, LMB-mediated inhibition of protein export from the nucleus by XPO1/CRM1 should retain the AtNMD3 proteins in the nucleus as well [36], [37]. To test this prediction, we detected the distribution of AtNMD3 upon treatment with LMB. The results showed that the distribution of transiently expressed XPO1/CRM1 (Figure S4) in the cytoplasm of protoplasts was inhibited by LMB (Figure 2D, E). Accordingly, the distribution of AtNMD3 in the cytoplasm was inhibited by LMB as well (Figure 2F, G), while that of EGFP was not affected (Figure 2H, I). These results indicated that AtNMD3 can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm as can XPO1/CRM1.. . . AtNMD3 Interacts with 60S Ribosomal Subunits and Affects Their Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Distribution. In yeast, the interaction between NMD3 and the ribosomal protein RPL10 has been reported to be required for release of NMD3 from the ribosome in the cytoplasm [38]-[41]. To clarify how AtNMD3 interacts with the 60S ribosomal subunit, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening for potential interacting ribosomal proteins (Figure S5). We found AtNMD3 interacted with Arabidopsis RPL15, the homolog of yeast RPL28, not with the Arabidopsis homolog to RPL10 (Figure S6A). According to the protein structure analysis, we found that yeast RPL28 is localized opposite to the RPL10 in the yeast ribosome (Figure S6B). Perhaps due to this difference, we failed to complement the yeast NMD3 mutant with AtNMD3, even though they have a significantly high protein sequence similarity (Figure S1 and S7).. If AtNMD3 does in fact interact with ribosomal proteins in planta, we believed that it would most likely co-localize with the 60S ribosomal subunits. To verify this prediction, we used inducible RPL28A-YFP transgenic Arabidopsis. [8] as source material for the collection and separation of YFP tagged ribosomes by sucrose density centrifugation. The fractionated samples were probed with antibodies against GFP (which also recognizes YFP), RPL15 and AtNMD3. Figure 3A shows co-localization of AtNMD3 with 60S as well as 80S ribosome components but not with 40S. This result further suggested that the AtNMD3 interacts with 60S ribosomal subunits.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0035904.g003. Figure 3. . AtNMD3 affects the nuclear export of 60S ribosomal subunits.. A. Immuno-detection of AtNMD3 proteins co-precipitated with 60S ribosomal subunits. The Commassie stained gel shows the separation of proteins fractionally collected after sucrose density centrifugation. The lower panels show the immune-detection of AtNMD3, YFP-RPL28A and RPL15. While RPL28A and RPL15 could be detected in all fractions containing 60S, the AtNMD3 was co-localized to some fractions containing 60S and 80S, but not 40S. B to G show the effects of AtNMD3 on RPL28A, a confirmed component of 60S. The EGFP labeled AtNMD3deltaNES was detected in the nuclei of root cells of the stable transgenic lines (Figure S8) at 488/509 nm (for EGFP) (B), but not at 515/535 nm (for YFP) (C). The YFP labeled RPL28A was detected in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of root cells at 515/535 nm (D). In the F1 cross of the two lines, both EGFP (E) and YFP (F) were centralized in the nuclei, suggesting that the RPL28A together with the 60S subunits were retained in the nuclei due to expression of AtNMD3deltaNES.. . . . To determine whether AtNMD3 is required for the nuclear export of 60S ribosomal subunits in planta, we crossed the transgenic Arabidopsis line overexpressing truncated AtNMD3 without the NES (the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line, Figure S8) with that containing RPL28A-YFP. We found that in the parental AtNMD3deltaNES OE line, the GFP signals could be detected only in the nuclei, and no yellow florescence was observed (Fig 3B, C). Meanwhile, in the RPL28A-YFP lines, the YFP signals could be detected in both the nuclei and cytoplasm (Figure 3D). However, in the F1 plants, the YFP signals could be clearly enriched in the nuclei (Figure 3E, F). This result indicated that AtNMD3 is required for the nuclear export of 60S ribosomal subunits in planta.. . . Overexpression of AtNMD3deltaNES Results in Defective Secondary Cell Wall Thickening. Although the role of NMD3 in the nuclear export of 60S ribosomal subunits has been well demonstrated in yeast and vertebrate cells, little is known about the effect of aberrant NMD3 function because NMD3 knockdown is lethal in both systems. In our pilot experiment, we found that in the T1 generation of AtNMD3 RNAi transgenic plants, there were pleiotropic phenotypes in plant development (Figure S2). In the T2 generation, we were not able to identify individuals with downregulated AtNMD3 at the RNA level in antibiotic resistant plants (data not shown). We were also not able to find any AtNMD3 RNA downregulation in the three available homozygous mutants, Cs849934, Salk_146277C (from Salk) and Pst14457 (from RIKEN) (Figure S9). These results implied that on the one hand, AtNMD3 may be indispensable for survival of plants as it is in yeast and vertebrates. On the other hand, a quantitative change in AtNMD3 levels may affect some aspects of plant development. To test the latter possibility, we adopted a dominant negative strategy to further analyze phenotypes of transgenic plants with overexpressed AtNMD3deltaNES (AtNMD3deltaNES OE line) that interferes with normal AtNMD3 function (Figures 2, 3; Figure S8).. Indeed, pleiotropic phenotypes were observed in the dominant negative transgenic Arabidopsis AtNMD3deltaNES OE line (Figure 4). Although the seedlings appeared roughly normal (Figure 4A, B), the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line showed dramatic differences in plant height and particularly in the length of internodes of the inflorescences after flowering compared with wild type plants (Figure 4C, D). Further observation revealed that all above-ground lateral organs showed some abnormalities in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line, such as obvious curly shape with zig-zag leaf margin of rosette leaves (Figure 4E), extra long-shaped cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf epidermis (Figure 4F-I), lack of obvious vascular veins in petals (Figure 4J, K), reduced stamen size (Figure 4 L, M), curved cells in carpel (Figure 4N, O) and obviously larger seeds (Figure 4P).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0035904.g004. Figure 4. . Dominant negative interference of AtNMD3 function causes pleiotropic morphogenetic defects.. A, B.

P shows enlarged seeds of the AtNMD3deltaNES OE lines. Bar=100 m.. . . . To understand how expression of the dominant negative AtNMD3 in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line resulted in such pleiotropic phenotypes, we carefully analyzed the phenotypes. Although the dwarfism (Figure 4C, D) could be caused by numerous defects, lack of veins in the petal (Figure 4J, K) suggested a possible defect in cell wall thickening. Considering the cell wall is a physical boundary for proper cell enlargement in morphogenesis, the defect in cell wall thickening may result in abnormal cell enlargement (Figure 4F-I) and organ enlargement (Figure 4E, P) as observed in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line. To test this possibility, we observed the cell wall thickening in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line. In Figure 5A and E, the xylem tissue in the stem vascular bundles and interfascicular fiber cells of the transgenic plants appeared under-differentiated comparing to that in the wild-type. Consistent with this observation, UV illumination revealed that the secondary cell wall thickening was obviously defective not only in the stem (Figure 5B, F), but also in the hypocotyls (Figure 5C, G). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination further confirmed that the secondary cell wall was significantly defective in the interfascicular fiber cells of the stem (Figure 5D, H).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0035904.g005. Figure 5. . Secondary cell wall thickening is severely defective in the AtNMD3-deltaNES OE line.. A to H show the defect of secondary cell wall thickening in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line. A to D show normal morphology of the Col-0 stem after semi-thin plastic sectioning (A) and free-hand sectioning for UV observation of the secondary cell walls (B), of Col-0 hypocotyl after free-hand sectioning (C), and of Col-0 stem after ultra-thin sectioning for TEM observation (D). E to H show abnormal morphology of counterpart samples collected from the AtNMD3deltaNES OE lines, indicating the defect of the secondary cell wall thickening. I shows the quantification of the cell wall components, indicating dramatic reductions of xylan (Xyl), cellulose and lignin. J shows the expression levels of cell wall related genes. (if: interfascicular fiber; xy: xylem; SW: secondary cell wall. Bar for A, B, C, E, F, G=50 m; D, H=2 m).. . . . To verify the morphological changes during secondary cell wall thickening, we analyzed the cell wall composition. As shown in Figure 5I, the cellulose content of the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line was dramatically reduced by 70%, and that of xylose, which represents the major hemicellulose component xylan, was also decreased by more than 50%. Combined with the reduced lignin level, all these observations suggest that the transgenic lines have abnormal secondary cell wall compositions, consistent with the defects described above.. To determine the molecular basis of the changes in the cell wall composition in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line, we examined the expressions of the major known genes responsible for cell wall synthesis at the RNA level by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that the transcriptional factor SND1/NST3, which acts as a master regulator for secondary cell wall formation, was down-regulated in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line (Figure 5J). Obviously reduced expressions of genes responsible for cellulose synthesis of secondary cell wall (CESA4/IRX5, CESA7/IRX3, and CESA8/IRX1) and lignin synthesis (4CLs, C4H, CAD4, COMAT) (Figure 5J) were also observed. These changes in gene expression were consistent with the alterations in cell wall composition. However, the examined genes for xylan synthesis were not clearly altered. Moreover, the genes responsible for cellulose synthesis of the primary cell wall (CESA1), for pectin synthesis (GUAT1), as well as for phloem and cambium formation (APL, RTM1, HB8 and ExpA9) showed increased levels of expression. These findings suggest a compensating response to the inhibited secondary cell wall thickening for maintaining the basic growth of plants.. Taken together, the data above revealed that the dominant negative interference of nuclear export of 60S ribosomal subunit resulted in the defect of the secondary cell wall thickening, which explains the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line.. . . The Defective Nuclear Export of 60S Ribosomal Subunit Affects the Formation of RER in the Transgenic Plants and May be Responsible for the Deficient Secondary Cell Wall Thickening. A remaining question is how the defect in nuclear export of the 60S ribosomal subunit might selectively affect secondary cell wall thickening. One possible explanation is that the 60S subunits retained in the nucleus could decrease protein synthesis by ribosomes, thereby impacting the requirements of the secondary cell wall formation. An alternative explanation, which is not mutually exclusive of the previous one, would be that the 60S subunits retained in the nucleus could affect the proper distribution of ribosomes in the cytoplasm or the aggregation of polysomes on the ER (as observed during cotton fiber development [34]), which is required for secondary cell wall thickening.. To test the first possibility described above, we first detected the protein content in the wild-type and the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line. Figure 6 A shows that the total leaf protein content was indeed significantly reduced in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE lines compared to the wild-type. Figure 6B shows that there was a significant decrease in the leaf chlorophyll content in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line compared to the wild-type. However, the reduction in both total leaf protein and chlorophyll contents did not appear to affect the protein compositions of the thylakoid membranes significantly when analyzed by BN-PAGE on the basis of thylakoid protein content (Figure 6C). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in the compositions of the main chlorophyll-protein complexes, such as photosystems I and II, between AtNMD3deltaNES OE line and the wild-type plants. If this finding were to be applicable universally in other biological processes in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line, it would be difficult to explain why only the secondary cell wall thickening process was selectively affected, unless to hypothesize that the secondary cell wall thickening required a dramatic increase in protein synthesis that could not be met in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0035904.g006. Figure 6. . Protein content of the photosynthesis machinery is reduced in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line.. A.

The difference between the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line and the wild-type was statistically significant at the level of p<0.05 (n=5). C. The complexes of thylakoid membranes analyzed by Blue Native electrophoresis and subsequent SDS-PAGE, showing no obvious difference in the photosynthetic apparatus between the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line and the wild-type.. . . . To test the second possibility, we analyzed whether there was an abnormal distribution of ribosomes during secondary cell wall thickening in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line. According to Rogers and Campbell [42] and Ye et al [43], the process of secondary cell wall thickening is best observed in the interfascicular fibers. Considering the dwarf phenotype of the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line and its potential differences from the wild-type in cellular differentiation along with the stem elongation, we arbitrarily collected the samples from the plants with 15 internodes at four particular positions to ensure comparability of the stem samples: the first position was the internode below the flower just opened on the sampling day; the second position was the internode below the last cauline leaf; the third position was the internode just below the first cauline leaf; and the fourth position was the internode at the base of inflorescence (Figure 7A). Based on observations of plastic sections and TEM analysis of the samples, we found that the cellular differentiation status in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line was about one position behind that of the wild-type plants. For example, the cellular differentiation status of position 3 in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line is roughly comparable with that of position 2 in the wild-type (Figure 7B-M). The following comparisons of ultra-cellular structures were made of the samples from positions 1, 2 and 3 in the wild-type with that from positions 2, 3 and 4 in the AtNMD3-deltaNES OE line, respectively (Figure 7N-S).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0035904.g007.

In the comparison between the samples from the wild-type and the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line at their respective positions, we further confirmed the secondary cell wall defects in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line (Figure 7E-G, positions 2-4 of the wild-type and Figure 7K-M, positions 2-4 of the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line). While we did not identify obvious differences in other ultra-cellular structures, we found dynamic changes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; Figure 7N-S, indicated by arrows). Using the relative lengths of the ER, both the smooth (SER) or rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) in the observed cytoplasmic area as a criterion, excluding the areas of plastids and mitochondria, we quantified the dynamic changes in the amount of ER at the interfascicular fiber cells during stem development. Figure 7T (for details see Figure S10) shows that in the wild-type plants, the relative length of the ER was obviously increased in the interfascicular fiber cells at the position 2 internode compared to the position 1 internode, while this was dramatically decreased at the position 3 internode when the secondary cell wall thickening process was completed. The dynamic changes in the amount of ER could also been observed in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line (Figure 7T). This phenomenon suggests that the amount of ER is correlated with the cellular differentiation along with the stem development (Figure 7A).. It is worth noting, however, that in the wild-type plants, the ER consisted almost entirely of RER while in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line the ER at position 3, which is developmentally equivalent to the position 2 in the wild-type plants, consisted mainly of SER. We carried out further statistical analysis of the distribution of RER and SER (Table S2). Figure 7U shows that there were no significant differences in terms of the relative length of RER and SER in the comparable cells at the wild-type position 1 vs. AtNMD3deltaNES OE position 2 and the wild-type position 3 vs. AtNMD3deltaNES OE position 4. In contrast, the relative length of the RER was significantly lower in the comparable cells at AtNMD3deltaNES OE position 3 than at the wild-type position 2, and that of the SER was significantly higher in the comparable cells at AtNMD3deltaNES OE position 3 than at the wild-type position 2. These observations suggest that during stem development, the secondary cell wall thickening may require the rapid accumulation of ER and ribosomes to form the RER in order to ensure the rapid build-up of the machinery required for the mass synthesis of cell wall components. Without the proper nuclear export of 60S ribosomal subunits, as in the AtNMD3deltaNES OE line, there would be no appropriate RER formation although the accumulation of ER would still occur. As a result, there would be no proper secondary cell wall thickening..
PMC2791111	Results. . Arabidopsis genotype analysis. Leaf DNA was extracted from individuals of Arabidopsis thaliana that putatively contained a mutant allele (with a T-DNA insertion) and from Col-0 (the background genotype of the putative mutant). This was used as the template in PCRs using a combination of primers specific to either the AAP6 locus or to the T-DNA used for mutagenesis. It was confirmed that individuals of the SAIL line used contain a T-DNA insertion (within intron 2). To determine the effect of the T-DNA insertion in the aap6 locus, the abundance of its transcript was assessed using RT-PCR. Although the predicted 1400 bp amplification product of the AAP6 transcript was readily detectable in extracts from the wild-type rosette leaves, no such product was amplified from aap6 mutant samples (Fig. 1). Amplification products representing a part of a positive control transcript (an actin mRNA) were detected in both wild-type and aap6 mutant samples.. . Fig. 1.. . RT-PCR analysis on cDNA obtained from aap6 mutant and wild-type rosette leaves using: (a) AAP6 gene-specific primers with aap6 cDNA; (b) AAP6 gene-specific primers with WT cDNA; (c) actin2-specific primers with aap6 cDNA; (d) actin2-specific primers with WT cDNA. The four lanes show PCR amplification after 20, 22, 24, and 26 cycles.. . . . Southern blot analysis was carried out using genomic DNA extracts from mutant aap6 leaves in order to determine the number of T-DNA inserts within the genome of this line. The HindIII-digested DNA samples were probed with a portion of the bar gene, which forms part of the T-DNA construct used to produce the SAIL insertion library. The results (Fig. 2) are consistent with the occurrence of a single T-DNA insertion into the genome and the size of the hybridizing restriction fragment is the same as that predicted by the allele model presented (Fig. 2d) where 4.7 kbp separate HindIII restriction sites within the T-DNA and the AAP6 gene.. .

PMC4744948	Results. . Auxin transport regulates the nuclear endocycle in hypocotyl cells. The surprising observation that instigated the present study was very strong and ectopic expression of a mitosis marker gene, proCYCB1;1:CYCB1;1-GUS (Coln-Carmona etal., 1999) in hypocotyls of b19-1 mutants (Figure1). This marker is used to visualize the pattern of endogenous CYCB1;1 which accumulates during the G2 to M phase of the cell cycle (Shaul etal., 1996). Instead of the signal being restricted to the shoot apical meristem and scattered locations within the young cotyledons as is typical of the wild type (Figure1a), b19-1 hypocotyls displayed a strong signal throughout the seedling, particularly in the upper hypocotyl (Figure1b). This signal is apparently distributed across the epidermis, cortex and central cylinder (Figure1b inset). This reporter-gene phenotype was detectable as early as 1day after germination (Figure1c). If this cyclin promoter phenotype of b19 was related to auxin deficiency caused by the well documented defect in polar auxin transport down the hypocotyl from a major site of synthesis at the shoot apex (Noh etal., 2001; Geisler etal., 2005; Spalding, 2013), auxin treatment would be expected to restore normal CYCB1;1 reporter-gene signal patterns in the mutant. Auxin treatment indeed rescued the reporter-gene pattern, particularly faithfully when presented at the extremely low concentration of 2.5nm or 1mum IAA (Figure1d,e). Moreover, treatment of the wild type with naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), an inhibitor of polar auxin transport, caused an upregulation and abnormal spread of the reporter-gene signal, partially phenocopying the b19 mutant (Figure1f). At the mRNA level, the reporter gene was expressed similarly in the mutant and wild type (WT 1.000.16 versus b19 1.320.44, P-value=0.54) as determined by quantitative PCR. The native CYCB1;1 gene was not overexpressed in b19 relative to wild type (FigureS1). These transcript analyses indicate that the conspicuous spread of the proCYCB1;1:CYCB1;1-GUS signal is due to defective degradation of the protein mediated by the destruction box domain of the CYCB1;1 coding sequence (Coln-Carmona etal., 1999). The endogenous CYCB1;1 protein is expected to share this reporter signal pattern.. . Figure 1. . Auxin transport determines the expression pattern of a cycle reporter gene.. Compared with WT (a), CYCB1;1-GUS expression is strongly up-regulated in the hypocotyl of b19-1 mutant seedlings (b) grown for 2.5DAG in 10mumolm-2sec-1 white light. The inset shows a b19-1 hypocotyl cross-section. This phenotype also is apparent in 1-day-old seedlings (c). Auxin application rescues the reporter-gene phenotype (d, e), and the auxin transport blocker NPA partially phenocopies the mutant (f).. . . . Hypocotyls are not expected to display mitotic markers because cell divisions after embryogenesis are restricted to the few scattered epidermal cells forming stomata and rarely in the central cylinder (Gendreau etal., 1997). Therefore, the auxin-dependent CYCB1;1 reporter phenotype in an organ consisting almost entirely of non-dividing cells was considered an important phenomenon to understand. We began by determining if mitosis was occurring ectopically where the reporter was active. The number of cortical cells in a file the length of the hypocotyl was the same for wild type (332; n=20 seedlings) and b19-1 (331; n=20 seedlings). The mean number of stomata along one flank of a b19-3 hypocotyl (1.70.5, n=7) was lower (P<0.05) than the wild-type value (3.50.5, n=8). Thus, high ectopic expression of a mitotic marker in b19 was not associated with increased frequency of cell division. An alternative hypothesis, that CYCB1;1 misregulation indicates an effect on the endocycle, a variant of the cell cycle in which doubling of the nuclear genome is not followed by cytokinesis (De Veylder etal., 2011), was tested first by measuring nuclear size in cortical cells of the upper hypocotyl because ploidy and nuclear size may be correlated (Jovtchev etal., 2006). Figure2a shows representative b19-1 nuclei marked by H2B-YFP in cortical cells of the upper hypocotyl. They appeared smaller than wild-type nuclei. The probability distribution functions fitted to manual measurements of wild-type and b19 nuclear sizes from confocal microscopy images differed to a statistically-significant degree (P<0.01) as determined by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and showed that nuclei from b19 hypocotyls on average were smaller than wild type (Figure2b). The b19 distribution displayed less evidence of peaks corresponding to higher ploidy levels than wild type. Therefore, ploidy levels were more directly examined by measuring nuclear DNA content in populations of b19 and wild-type nuclei by flow cytometry. Figure3(a) shows a representative frequency histogram of the fluorescence signals from a population of upper-hypocotyl nuclei measured by flow cytometry. The peaks clearly distinguish the different ploidy classes for individual nuclei. From the histograms it was determined that nuclei isolated from the upper region of b19 hypocotyls are more likely to have two copies of the genome (2C) and less likely to have 8C than the wild type (Figure3b). A double mutant in which the related ABCB1 gene is also disrupted (b1 b19), which more severely inhibits polar auxin transport in hypocotyls (Noh etal., 2001), displayed a slightly stronger ploidy phenotype as evidenced by the lack of the highest detectable 32C category of nuclei. The TWD1 gene encodes an immunophilin protein that is required for proper trafficking of B1 and B19 to the plasma membrane (Bouchard et al., 2006). Morphologically, b1 b19 and twd1 mutants are almost indistinguishable due to missing or mislocalized ABCB proteins, respectively (Wu etal., 2010b). Figure3(b) shows that the ploidy distributions in twd1-1 nuclei are essentially indistinguishable from those isolated from b1 b19 double mutants. A formula can convert the class distributions show in Figure3(b) to the average number of nuclear doublings that have occurred in the populations of nuclei, a metric known as the cycle value or endoreplication index. Interpretation of this value assumes no mitosis, which was verified in the cortex where we expect most of the sampled nuclei originate. Figure3(c) shows cycle values calculated from the results shown in Figure3(b) to capture the low ploidy phenotype of the auxin-transport mutants in a single value. Figure3(d) shows that treatment of intact hypocotyls with 2.5nm IAA did not affect the cycle value of wild-type nuclei but completely rescued the b19-3 nuclear defect. Because evidence of mitosis was not observed, these cycle value differences can be interpreted as differences in rates of endoreplication. Thus, impaired polar auxin transport through the hypocotyl results in misregulation of the CYCB1;1 reporter gene and lower endocycle activity.. . Figure 2. .

Significant differences between WT and mutants are indicated with *(P-value<0.05). The ecotype background is Ws for the genotypes represented in panels (b, c) and Col-0 in panel (d).. . . . . . The molecular basis of the auxin transport effect on the endocycle. A survey of cell-cycle gene expression was conducted in wild-type and b19 upper hypocotyls to learn more about the effects of altered auxin transport on the molecules controlling mitosis exit and endocycle entry (Lammens etal., 2008). Quantitative PCR was used to measure the mRNA levels of 16 cyclin genes expected to be relevant in hypocotyls based on expression data (http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi). Of the cyclin genes tested, CYCD4;1 and CYCD4;2 were significantly down-regulated in b19 (FigureS1a). Similar results were obtained in a second allele of b19 in a different ecotype background (FigureS1b). These gene expression phenotypes were rescued by 2.5nm IAA (FigureS1b). In Arabidopsis, these two cyclins form active kinase complexes with CDKA;1 that promote G1/S and G2/M transitions (De Veylder etal., 2011). The lower ploidy and the fewer stomata in b19 may result from reduced CYCD4 levels, which appear to be the result of reduced auxin transport.. The onset of endoreplication requires the multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to degrade mitotic cyclins (Cebolla et al., 1999; Zheng etal., 2011). In Arabidopsis, three CELL CYCLE SWITCH 52 proteins known as CCS52A1, CCS52A2 and CCS52B form part of the APC/C and influence its activity and substrate specificity (Flp etal., 2005; De Veylder etal., 2011). The abnormally high activity of the CYCB1;1 reporter and the lower ploidy in b19 hypocotyls (Figures1, 2, 3) are possibly the result of low levels of the CCS52 activators and therefore low APC/C activity in the mutant. To investigate this potential explanation, we measured mRNA levels of CCS52A1, CCS52A2 and CCS52B in upper-hypocotyl sections. Only CCS52A2 expression was detected in the wild type. Its mRNA level was significantly lower in b19 and wild-type seedlings treated with NPA (Figure4a). Treatment with IAA (2.5nm or 1mum) rescued the CCS52A2 expression phenotype of the b19 mutant. The auxin-insensitive mutant axr3-1 also displayed lower CCS52A2 expression. The CCS52A2 protein level was also lower in b19 and NPA-treated wild-type seedlings, as determined by measuring GFP fluorescence in nuclei of transgenic plants expressing a previously characterized functional CCS52A2-GFP fusion under the control of its native promoter (Vanstraelen etal., 2009). As a control, the H2B-YFP fluorescent histone (Boisnard-Lorig etal., 2001) was not affected by loss of B19 or NPA treatment (Figure4b,c). Collectively, these results indicate that polar auxin transport controls CCS52A2 expression in a manner that may explain the CYCB1;1 reporter phenotype observed in b19. A genetic test of this hypothesis was arranged by crossing the proCYCB1;1:CYCB1;1-GUS reporter into a ccs52a2 mutant. Figure5 shows the pattern of CYCB1;1 accumulation visualized by GUS staining was clearly not affected by the ccs52a2 mutation. A phenocopy of the b19 CYCB1;1 pattern was not observed. The result indicates that lowering CCS52A2 levels is not sufficient to cause ectopic overexpression of CYCB1;1. A linear pathway in which auxin delivered by ABCB19-dependent polar transport promotes the CCS52A2-dependent E3 ligase that degrades CYCB1;1 to restrict its expression pattern is not supported.. .

The relationship between ABCB19-dependent auxin transport, hypocotyl elongation, and cycle value was tested here by acquiring digital time-lapse images and analysis utilizing the HYPOTrace software tool (Wang etal., 2009), following the methods Wu etal. (2010a) used to study the connections between ABCB19-dependent auxin transport and the photocontrol of hypocotyl elongation. Figure6(a) shows that wild-type and b19 seedlings differed in growth rate most significantly between 2.5 and 3days after germination, which was also the period of fastest hypocotyl elongation. These results were used to design image-based assays of growth rate specifically over the 2.5-3days time period to determine the effects of auxin. A dose-response analysis demonstrated that nanomolar concentrations of auxin in the medium contacting the seedlings rescued the slow hypocotyl growth phenotype of b19 seedlings (Figure6b). Higher concentrations of IAA were inhibitory to both genotypes as previously documented (Collett etal., 2000). A primary role of auxin in the control of this phase of peak hypocotyl growth rate was further supported by showing that axr2 and axr3 auxin signaling mutants were impaired similar to or even more than b19 mutants (Figure6c), consistent with previously published hypocotyl end-point measurements (Nagpal etal., 2000). If lower ploidy caused by reduced auxin flow to the growth zone reduces hypocotyl elongation then mutating CCS52A2 while leaving B19 intact would be expected to reduce hypocotyl growth rate. Figure6(c) shows this to be the case. Furthermore, the low growth rate of a ccs52a2 mutant could not be rescued by auxin, though high auxin (1mum) had its normal inhibitory effect (Figure6c). Apparently, low concentrations of auxin promote growth by a mechanism that involves CCS52A2 but the inhibitory effects of micromolar auxin occur independently of CCS52A2.. . Figure 6. . Auxin transport is required for hypocotyl elongation.. (a) High-resolution time courses of hypocotyl growth for 48h beginning 2.5days after germination under 10mumolm-2sec-1 white light. Images were automatically collected every 10min and processed by a custom image analysis program. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean (n=6-8 individuals for each genotype/treatment).. (b) Response of growth rate during the period of fastest elongation (2.5-3days after germination) to dose of exogenous IAA in WT (Col-0) and b19-3 seedlings (n>20 per genotype/treatment).. (c) Nanomolar auxin restores low hypocotyl elongation of b19-3 but not ccs52a2 mutants to WT (Col-0) levels (n>20 per genotype/treatment).. . . . A ccs52a2 b19-3 double mutant was created. Figure6(c) shows its phenotype to be consistent with the sum of the two constituent components. Nanomolar levels of auxin promoted elongation to a small extent, presumably by rescuing the b19 genetic component. It appears that auxin promotes hypocotyl growth through CCS52A2-dependent and CCS52A2-independent pathways.. Figure7(a) co-plots cycle value and growth rate data both obtained 2.5-3 DAG with wild-type and b19-3 seedlings with or without auxin, and data from an axr3 mutant, all in the Col-0 genetic background. The data show a striking rescue of b19 ploidy (cycle value) and growth rate by 2.5nm auxin. Clearly, the nuclear endocycle and growth rate in the auxin-transport mutant are both auxin-limited. Supplying auxin at a level high enough to restore the deficiency but low enough to avoid inducing inhibition allowed this response to be quantified. The wild type is not auxin deficient and therefore did not respond with respect to either the cycle value or growth rate. The auxin-insensitive axr3 mutant has a cycle value and growth rate pair similar to an auxin-deficient mutant (b19). A logarithmic relationship was obtained between ploidy (cycle value) and growth rate when the latter was measured over a period of development spanning from 2 to 5days after germination and the former was altered by mutations, chemical treatments, or light (Figure7b).. .

PMC4632659	Results. We found that the expressions of 137 miRNAs (P<0.01, signal intensity >0) were significantly changed both in DP and IDL leaves. Among them, the expression levels of 44 miRNAs were relative higher than others (P<0.01, signal intensity >500). Of these differentially expressed miRNAs, 6 miRNAs (miR319a, 319c, miR159, miR164a, miR164c and miR390a) have been previously reported to be involved in dark-induced leaf senescence, and the remaining 38 miRNAs have not been implicated in leaf senescence before. Target genes of all 44 miRNAs were predicted, and some of them, such as NAC1, At3g28690, At2g17640 and At2g45160, were found in the Leaf Senescence Database (LSD). GO and KEGG analysis of 137 miRNAs showed that the predicted target genes were significantly enriched in transcription regulation, development-related biological processes and metabolic pathways. Expression levels of some of the corresponding miRNA targets (At1g73440, At2g03220 and At5g54810) were analysed and found to be significantly different in DP/IDL than that in WT..
PMC3826630	Results. . A link between WAT1 and auxin responses. A microarray-wide search for the most highly co-regulated genes with WAT1 (ref. 21) resulted in the identification of several genes involved in auxin transport and signalling (that is, AUX1, IAA9, IAA13, LAX2, ARF4, ARF11 and PIN1; Fig. 1). Consistent with the cell wall phenotype of wat1 mutants, other WAT1 co-regulated genes are known to be essential for either vascular patterning (ATHB-8 and ATHB-15) or secondary wall deposition (IRX9, MYB43, KNAT7 and FRA1). Strikingly, the expression of several of these genes, including WAT1 itself, is also induced by auxin (Figs 1 and 2).. Phenotypic alterations resulting from the wat1 mutation have been reported at late stages of plant stem development; however, WAT1 is expressed much earlier in plant development19 (Fig. 2). To elucidate primary effects of the wat1 mutation, we carried out comparative microarray analysis profiling mRNA global expression of 10-day-old in vitro-grown wild-type and wat1-1-mutant seedlings. This revealed 40 genes that exhibited significantly altered expression levels in wat1-1, with 13 genes displaying lower and 27 higher mRNA levels compared with the wild type (Supplementary Fig. S1). The two most downregulated genes, besides WAT1 itself, were IAA19 and an auxin-responsive GH3 family member both known to be associated with auxin responses. Among the 13 downregulated genes, at least 7 are induced by auxin in wild-type plants according to the Genevestigator database22 (Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, among the 27 genes upregulated in wat1, 5 are repressed by auxin in wild-type plants (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results revealed that the wat1-1 mutation modulates the expression levels of several auxin-responsive genes.. Finally, to determine whether there is a causal link between lower auxin content and the fibre phenotype in wat1 stems19, we locally applied auxin (2,4-D and NAA) to growing stem segments of wat1. Ten days after auxin application, cell wall thickness of wat1 interfascicular fibres was restored to wild-type levels (Fig. 3). These results confirm the role of auxin in promoting xylem fibre differentiation2324.. . . WAT1 is a tonoplast-localized auxin transporter. The WAT1 gene encodes a plant-specific protein of 389 amino acids19 predicted to have 10 transmembrane domains, and it has been classified as a member of the Plant Drug Metabolite Exporter family (Transport Classification Database (http://www.tcdb.org)2526). Although PINs and AUX1 are members of the auxin efflux carrier and amino acid/auxin permease families, respectively, several of them also possess 10 predicted transmembrane domain. Although WAT1 did not exhibit sequence homology with any of the other auxin transporters, its predicted secondary structure was similar, showing the greatest resemblance with the ER-localized PIN5 and PILS2/5 proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2). Beyond their similarity in size, they have a centrally localized, shorter hydrophilic loop in comparison with the long PINs (PIN1-4, 7).. Although WAT1 has been previously detected in both plasma membrane and tonoplast fractions in systematic proteomic studies2728, we found very little co-localization of WAT1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) with the plasma membrane marker, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-NPSN12 (ref. 29) (Fig. 4a). In contrast, WAT1-GFP co-localized to the greatest extent with the tonoplast marker, YFP-VAMP711 (Fig. 4a), consistent with our previous interpretation that WAT1 may be a tonoplast-localized protein19. WAT1-GFP exhibited some overlapping fluorescent signal with the late endosomal marker, YFP-RabG3f, but to a lesser extent than with YFP-VAMP711. As in the case for the tonoplast marker YFP-VAMP711, WAT1-GFP localization was also insensitive to Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that WAT1-GFP was delivered to the tonoplast by a BFA-insensitive, Golgi-independent pathway30.. The subcellular localization of WAT1 and its structural resemblance to auxin carriers prompted us to test the capacity of WAT1 to transport indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) across the tonoplast membrane. Therefore, we isolated vacuoles from wat1 and wild-type mesophyll protoplasts and carried out transport studies using 14C-IAA. Experiments were conducted at pH 7.6, a condition under which IAA is present mainly in the anionic, unprotonated form, and diffusion is minimal. As a control, 3H2O was added to the incubation medium as water readily diffuses through biological membranes. This confirmed the volume, intactness and stability of both wild-type and wat1 vacuole populations.. Auxin did not accumulate in wild-type vacuoles, whereas in wat1 vacuoles, the auxin concentration increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4b). If we assume that auxin uptake rates are similar in both vacuole populations, this points to an efficient, WAT1-dependent auxin efflux from wild-type vacuoles, which is obviously absent in wat1 vacuoles. As exporting anionic auxin from the vacuole is thermodynamically uphill, a likely energy source would be the coupling with downhill transport of protons (for a review, see ref. 31). Therefore, we hypothesize that WAT1 is a tonoplast-localized transporter that exports auxin from the vacuole to the cytoplasm, perhaps operating as a H+:IAA- symporter.. To test this hypothesis, additional vacuole transport experiments were performed under conditions that ensured a drastic reduction of the driving force for proton-coupled exporters (Fig. 4c). NH4+, a proton gradient dissipater, was added to the external buffer, whereas Mg-ATP was omitted to avoid compensation of proton gradient dissipation by V-ATPase-mediated proton pumping into the vacuole. In this experiment, NH4+ should theoretically reduce IAA efflux from wild-type vacuoles, resulting in a net increase in vacuolar IAA concentration over time. This was the case (Fig. 4c), thereby supporting the hypothesis that WAT1 operates as a H+-IAA- symporter. In the presence of NH4+ and absence of Mg-ATP, not only is the pH gradient expected to decrease but also the difference in electrical potential across the tonoplast, which is a driving force for IAA- uptake. This explains the decrease in IAA accumulation in wat1 vacuoles in the presence of NH4+ (absence of Mg-ATP; Fig. 4c) versus the absence of NH4+ and presence of Mg-ATP (Fig. 4b). It is noteworthy that the reduced difference in membrane potentials should lead to a similar reduction of IAA influx towards the vacuole lumen in wild type. The fact that a net increase of IAA levels in wild-type vacuoles in the presence of NH4+ was observed strengthens our conclusion that WAT1 efflux was primarily affected by NH4+ application. Finally, to determine whether the radiolabelled 14C detected during vacuolar transport experiments was uniquely associated with IAA or converted to other related metabolites, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed on wild-type vacuoles. Only one major peak corresponding to IAA was detected, confirming that the radiolabel was associated uniquely to IAA (Fig. 5). Altogether, these results strongly support the hypothesis that WAT1 mediates IAA export from the vacuole.. These findings raised the question as to whether auxin is actually present in plant vacuoles. Although early physiological studies in the green alga Hydrodictyon32 speculated that the vacuole of higher plants might represent a pool of symplastic auxin33, experimental evidence for vacuolar auxin in plants is still lacking. To address whether auxin is found in Arabidopsis vacuoles, vacuoles were purified from protoplasts of wild-type leaves and IAA and related metabolites were measured (Table 1). Vacuole purity was first confirmed by western blots using antibodies detecting different cellular compartment markers (Supplementary Fig. S4). Strikingly, IAA, several of its precursors, the IAA catabolite oxIAA (oxIAA) and the conjugate IAA-Glc could be detected in purified vacuoles (Table 1), suggesting an important role for the vacuole in auxin storage and regulation of auxin homoeostasis in Arabidopsis. The apparent discrepancy in our observations that auxin and related metabolites were found in isolated vacuoles while isolated wild-type vacuoles did not take up auxin in transport experiments (Fig. 4b) suggests that WAT1 can act as an efficient auxin exporter but that its activity is likely regulated in vivo.. . . WAT1 auxin transport activity in yeast and Xenopus oocytes. To confirm WAT1 auxin transport activity, we cloned the complementary DNA of WAT1 into the yeast expression vector pDR196 and introduced it into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-PCR, WAT1 was highly expressed in yeast transformed with pDR196-WAT1 (Fig. 6a). When fused with GFP, WAT1 localized to the plasma membrane of yeast cells (Fig. 6b). WAT1 expression resulted in a significant increase in radiolabelled 3H-IAA uptake as compared with the empty vector control (Fig. 6c). The specificity of IAA transport was confirmed by performing 3H-IAA transport in the presence of various non-radioactive potential competitors (Fig. 6d). 3H-IAA influx in yeast expressing WAT1 was greatly inhibited by unlabelled IAA (69%) and to a lesser degree (25% and 27%) by oxIAA and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), respectively. Conjugated forms of IAA (IAA-L-alanine, IAA-L-phenylalanine and IAA-Glc) and other forms of natural or synthetic auxinic compounds (indole-3-butyric acid and 2,4-D) did not reduce WAT1-mediated 3H-IAA influx in yeast. Finally, WAT1 did not facilitate 3H-Trp uptake (Fig. 6e). WAT1-mediated IAA influx was further confirmed by testing it in an independent heterologous expression system: Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 6f). As compared with water-injected oocytes, WAT1 complementary ribonucleic acid (cRNA)-injected oocytes incorporated significantly more 3H-IAA. WAT1 did not facilitate Trp import or export in oocytes: influx and efflux of 15N-labelled Trp in WAT1-expressing oocytes were 100.02%0.13 (n=11) and 101.13%1.09 (n=8) that of control oocytes, respectively (means.d.). These data confirm that WAT1 catalyses a net influx of IAA, in agreement with data obtained in yeast. These results demonstrate that WAT1-mediated IAA transport activity does not require any additional, plant-specific components.. It is important to note that transporters maintain their orientation with respect to the cytoplasm so that protein domains facing the cytoplasm in the native context also face the cytoplasm in these heterologous expression systems. Therefore, if the thermodynamic conditions are favourable, they also maintain their direction of transport (with respect to the cytosol) when targeted to a different membrane in heterologous expression systems (in this case, the plasma membrane as opposed to the tonoplast)1434. The conditions used in our heterologous expression systems are compatible with the thermodynamics between the cytosol and vacuole. Therefore, WAT1-mediated IAA import from the medium towards the cytosol in yeast and oocytes would correspond to vacuolar export towards the cytosol (equivalent to the external solution in isolated vacuoles experiments).Therefore, yeast and oocyte IAA transport data both independently confirm that WAT1 acts as an auxin exporter in vacuoles..
PMC3733156	Results. . AtRAC7/ROP9 has an expression pattern distinct from other type II RAC/ROPs. In order to characterize the spatial and temporal expression of AtRAC7/ROP9 in Arabidopsis, transgenic plants carrying a fusion of the AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter and the GUS gene (AtRAC7p-GUS) were generated. The AtRAC7p-GUS lines obtained were stained for GUS activity at different stages of development and a representative line was used for detailed characterization. Contrary to what was observed previously for AtRAC8/ROP10 (Zheng et al., 2002) and AtRAC10/ROP11 (Li et al., 2012a. ; Yu et al., 2012), where both genes were expressed in the majority of the tissues tested, including stomata and pollen, the pattern for AtRAC7/ROP9 expression was considerably more discrete (Fig. 1). AtRAC7/ROP9p activity was detected in the developing embryo (Fig. 1A-C) and in the young seedlings (Fig. 1D). Later in development, GUS expression became restricted to the shoot and root meristems (Fig. 1E) and the vascular system (Fig. 1F); no expression was detected in female or male reproductive tissues or in stomata (Fig. 1G, H). The expression pattern of AtRAC7/ROP9 in the root meristem and in the lateral root primordia was striking (Fig. 1E, I, J). Promoter activity was detected at the lateral root primordia (Fig. 1I), and as the root developed it became restricted to the meristem (Fig. 1J).. . Fig. 1.. . Developmental expression pattern of the AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter in Arabidopsis as observed by histochemical GUS staining. AtRAC7/ROP9p-GUS expression was detected in the developing embryo (A-C) and in the germinating seedling (D). In young seedlings, activity was detected in the meristematic region (arrow), lateral root primordia (arrow heads) (E) and in the vascular system (F). No AtRAC7/ROP9 expression was detected in stomata (G). In female and male reproductive organs, expression was detected only in the vascular system (H) and, notably, no expression was detected in pollen. High levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 expression were observed in the developing lateral roots (I) and in the meristem of elongating lateral roots (J).. . . . To determine how early in lateral root development AtRAC7/ROP9 is expressed, a lateral root-inducible system based on treatments with an auxin transport inhibitor was used (Himanen et al., 2002). Auxin transport inhibitors have been shown to prevent the formative divisions in the pericycle that lead to lateral root initiation (Casimiro et al., 2001).When AtRAC7p-GUS seedlings were grown in basal medium for 3 d, staining was observed in the dividing cells giving rise to the lateral root primordium and 48h later in the apical meristem of well-developed lateral roots (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, AtRAC7p-GUS seedlings grown for 3 d in medium supplemented with 1 muM TIBA did not show any GUS-positive lateral root primordia, consistent with lateral root initiation being inhibited. These seedlings were transferred to basal medium and tested for GUS at 12h intervals. GUS activity was detectable only in the apical root meristem up to 24h after transfer and no lateral root initiation sites were visible in these TIBA-treated plants (data not shown). Between 24 and 48h after transfer, the first lateral root initiation sites became visible and AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter activity was detected when the first divisions leading to lateral root primordia formation were occurring (Fig. 2A). In addition, GUS expression was detected along the whole pericycle layer when auxin was applied to AtRAC7p-GUS seedlings (Supplementary Fig. 1A at JXB online). These observations are consistent with AtRAC7/ROP9 being transcriptionally upregulated during auxin-induced lateral root initiation in Arabidopsis using microarray analysis (Vanneste et al., 2005) and further illustrate the fact that the AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter is only active in specific cell types in developing seedlings, even under auxin-activated conditions.. . Fig. 2.. . AtRAC7/ROP9 is expressed in the early stages of lateral root formation. (A) Activity of the AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter was studied in a lateral root-inducible system. AtRAC7p-GUS seedlings were grown for 3 d in medium containing 0 or 1 muM TIBA (pre-treatment). After this period, some seedlings were stained for GUS activity (0h) and the remaining seedlings were transferred to medium without TIBA and stained for GUS activity 48h after transfer. (B-H) GFP-AtRAC7/ROP9 is specifically detected at the plasma membrane of the pericycle cells that divide to form the lateral root primordia. (B-D) lateral root initials; (E, F) emerging lateral roots; (G) two focal planes of a primary root showing GFP-AtRAC7/ROP9 is only detected at the root tip; bracket region magnified in (H). (D) lower panel, a single confocal plane; (F) maximum projection from serial confocal sections; scale bar = 50 mum.. . . . In transformed plants grown under normal conditions, low levels of GFP-AtRAC7/ROP9 expressed from the AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter could be detected in the pericycle cells as early as the first divisions that give rise to the primordium, and continued to be restricted to the primodium as it developed (Fig. 2B-F). In the primary root, GFP-AtRAC7/ROP9 was only observed at the root tip (Fig. 2G, H). Furthermore, and unlike type I RAC/ROPs whose inactive and activated forms partition into the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane, respectively, the GFP-AtRAC7/ROP9 protein was found to be constitutively associated with the plasma membrane in root cells and in transfected protoplasts (Fig. 2D, lower panel, and H, Supplementary Fig. S1B).. . . Downregulation of the AtRAC7/ROP9 gene causes embryo patterning defects. The distinctive pattern of expression of the AtRAC7/ROP9 gene prompted a more detailed investigation of the functions of the AtRAC7/ROP9 protein in plants. None of the available T-DNA insertion mutants resulted in plants with reduced levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 mRNA (data not shown). To circumvent this problem, we used RNAi technology to generate plants with downregulated levels of AtRAC7/ROP9. A fragment of the AtRAC7/ROP9 cDNA at the 3 end (nt 361-660) was chosen to make the construct because it is the most variable region between the Arabidopsis RAC/ROP genes. Compared with other transformations, we experienced a considerably higher level of lethality among T1-transformed plants selected from several independent transformation experiments. Many showed seedling defects resulting in their failing to grow to maturity. Of the 68 independent lines recovered, we were unable to find a line with no detectable levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 mRNA. Of the homozygous lines that showed substantially reduced levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 mRNA, we chose the Ri-6, Ri-10, and Ri-11 lines for further analysis (Fig. 3A). The mRNA levels of other RAC/ROPs, including those of the most related AtRAC8/ROP10 and AtRAC10/ROP11 and of the type I AtRAC3/ROP6, were not affected in these lines (Fig. 3A). Among the progeny, we observed some developmental defects (Fig. 3B). An increased rate of seedlings showed arrested primary root growth (Table 1 and Fig. 3B), and there was a small but significant increase in the number of seedlings where the primary root did not develop and in those with defective cotyledons (Table 1). We always observed a range of phenotypes (from severe to mild) in the progeny from homozygous RNAi lines, reflecting the fact that these lines still maintained some AtRAC7/ROP9 activity or that other compensatory pathways were activated (Fig. 3B).. . Fig. 3.. . Reduced levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 mRNA result in developmental defects. (A) RT-PCR analysis of AtRAC7/ROP9 expression levels in wild-type plants and selected AtRAC7/ROP9 RNAi (Ri) lines. Ri-6, Ri-10, and Ri-11 had substantially reduced levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 mRNA, while AtRAC8/ROP10, AtRAC10/ROP11, and AtRAC3/ROP6 mRNA levels were not affected in these lines. Actin was used as an internal control. (B) Growth defects in 8-day-old vertically grown seedlings observed among the progeny of the lines in (A). (C) Embryo defects observed in plants with reduced levels of AtRAC7/ROP9. From left to right, 16-cell stage, 32-cell stage, and globular and triangular stages.

To look at the embryo phenotype in more detail, progeny seeds from homozygous plants were analysed to determine the prevalence of defects. As can be seen in Fig. 3C, some of the embryos of both RNAi lines showed abnormal cell divisions in both the embryo proper and suspensor at the 16- and 32-cell stage (Fig. 3C, first two columns). In globular- and triangular-stage embryos (Fig. 3C, last two columns), we observed atypical cell divisions in the hypophyseal cell region (arrows and brackets).The rate of abnormal embryos in the line Ri-6 was 5% (n=126) and in Ri-11 was 5.8% (n=165), whereas no abnormal embryos were detected in the wild type (n=178). The embryo defect frequency was comparable to that detected at early embryogenesis for plants with reduced levels of ROPGEF7 (Chen et al., 2011) and was most likely the combined result of residual AtRAC7/ROP9 protein in these lines and the presence of other RAC/ROPs that compensate for the reduced AtRAC7/ROP9 during embryo development. Although occurring at a lower frequency, the embryo defects observed in the AtRAC7/ROP9 RNAi lines also resembled the phenotypes of other auxin signalling mutants, such as the the auxin receptor mutant tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 (Dharmasiri et al., 2005) and root master regulator mutants plt1 plt2 plt3 and plt1 plt3 bbm-2 (Galinha et al., 2007). In these plt mutants, the effect of gene redundancy was also evident: single plt1 or plt2 mutants did not show an embryo phenotype, while in the double mutant plt1 plt2, some basal embryo defects were observed (Aida et al., 2004) and only disruption of all three PLT genes led to a severe embryonic phenotype with high ratio of defective embryos (Galinha et al., 2007). The early embryo defects observed in the embryo proper and abnormal cell organization in hypophyseal region in the RNAi lines probably caused some of the root phenotypes observed in seedlings (Fig. 3B). In addition, the root phenotypes observed later in development where primary root growth was arrested may have resulted from a post-embryonic effect of AtRAC7/ROP9. In soil, the plants that survived to maturity were indistinguishable from the wild type except that they were found to flower slightly but significantly earlier than wild-type plants (Supplementary Fig. S2C at JXB online). Primary root growth and lateral root numbers of the RNAi seedlings were not significantly different from the wild type (Supplementary Fig. S2A, B).. . . Downregulation of AtRAC7/ROP9 results in decreased responsiveness to ABA. To determine whether the AtRAC7/ROP9 protein participates in hormone signalling pathways, the RNAi lines were further characterized for their sensitivity to different exogenously applied hormones. First, we tested their responses to ABA, which is known to inhibit seed germination and root elongation. Seeds from the RNAi lines were less responsive to ABA inhibition of germination (Fig. 4A). Seeds from abi1-1, a mutant whose germination is insensitive to exogenous ABA (Koornneef et al., 1984), were used as a positive control for this experiment. ABA also increases seed dormancy, preventing germination under adverse conditions. Freshly harvested seeds were allowed to germinate without previous cold treatment. As can be seen in Fig. 4B (solid lines), AtRAC7/ROP9 RNAi seeds germinated faster that the wild type, implying that downregulation of AtRAC7/ROP9 gene expression decreased seed dormancy. When cold treated to break dormancy, the two lines germinated at similar rates (Fig. 4B, dashed lines). The observed effects of decreased levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 on seed dormancy and germination correlated well with AtRAC7/ROP9p activity being detected in embryos (Fig. 1A-C). Seedlings from AtRAC7/ROP9 RNAi lines were found to be less sensitive to ABA inhibition of root elongation over a wide range of tested concentrations (Fig. 4C). Further supporting the role of the AtRAC7/ROP9 protein as a positive regulator of ABA signalling, overexpression of AtRAC7/ROP9 in transiently transfected protoplasts increased transcription from an ABA signalling-responsive promoter, rd29A (Fig. 4D).. . Fig. 4.. . AtRAC7/ROP9 acts as a positive regulator of ABA signalling in Arabidopsis. (A) AtRAC7 RNAi seeds from AtRAC7/ROP9 RNAi lines are less sensitive to ABA inhibition of seed germination. Seeds were plated in medium containing the indicated ABA concentrations and germination (percentage germinated/total seeds) was determined after 3 d. Data represent means SE of three replicates with ~100 seeds each. The ABA-insensitive mutant abi1-1 in the Landsber erecta (Ler) background was used as a positive control. (B) Freshly harvested seeds from AtRAC7/ROP9 RNAi lines show decreased dormancy when compared with wild type seeds. Solid lines represent seeds allowed to germinate without previous cold treatment, with germination scored every day from day 1 to day 6. Dashed lines represent the germination percentage of the same seeds cold treated for 3 d before transfer to the growth chamber. Data represent means SE of three replicates with ~100 seeds each. (C) Seedlings with reduced levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 are less sensitive to ABA inhibition of root elongation. Root elongation in the ABA medium was calculated as a percentage of growth in medium without the hormone. Data represent means SE of three replicates with ten seedlings each. (D) Overexpression of AtRAC7/ROP9 stimulates transcription from an ABA-inducible rd29A promoter in transiently transformed protoplasts. An asterisk indicates values significantly different from the wild type grown under the same conditions for P <0.05.. . . . . . Plants with downregulated levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 expression show increased responses to auxin. The response of the RNAi lines to auxin was also tested. The suggestion that the auxin signalling pathway might be disturbed in these plants came from the observation of defective embryos. Auxin distribution and signalling are crucial for the regulation of cell division and patterning during embryo development. Moreover, auxin is an important regulator of lateral root formation and the ability of auxin, when applied exogenously, to induce lateral root formation is often used in assays to monitor auxin responses in the plant. When grown in medium containing 25 or 50nM of the auxin NAA, the RNAi lines were found to produce significantly more lateral roots than the wild type (Fig. 5A) and this effect was observed over an extended period of time (Fig. 5B). Another well-known effect of auxin is the inhibition of root elongation. In these assays, Ri-6 and Ri-11 seedlings were found to be more sensitive to inhibition of root elongation at low auxin concentrations (Fig. 5C). At higher concentrations, the effect was less pronounced, and only Ri-6 showed a small but significant difference from wild type (Fig. 5C). Consistent with plants having reduced levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 showing increased auxin responses, overexpression of AtRAC7/ROP9 in protoplasts repressed auxin-induced activity of the auxin-responsive DR5 promoter (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data suggested that AtRAC7/ROP9 plays a role as a negative modulator of auxin signalling pathways.. . Fig. 5.. . AtRAC7/ROP9 is a negative regulator of auxin signalling in Arabidopsis.

Three-day-old seedlings were transferred to medium containing 25 or 50nM NAA. The percentage of root growth in this medium was calculated relative to medium with no hormone. Bars represent means SE of three replicates with ten seedlings each. (D) AtRAC7/ROP9 represses auxin-induced gene expression in transfected protoplasts. Protoplasts were transfected with the reporter gene DR5-GUS with or without the effector construct 35S-AtRAC7 and cultured in the presence or absence of exogenous auxin as indicated. An asterisk indicates values significantly different from the wild type grown under the same conditions at P<0.05.. . . . The effect of decreased levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 in other hormone pathways was also tested. Induction of hypocotyl elongation in response to the application of the gibberellin GA3 in the AtRAC7/ROP9 RNAi seedlings was comparable to that of wild type (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Interestingly, the RNAi lines showed increased responsiveness to auxin induction of hypocotyl elongation when auxin was applied alone or together with GA3 (Supplementary Fig. S2D), consistent with the previous observations that plants with downregulated levels of AtRAC7/ROP9 were more responsive to auxin. The RNAi lines showed the same level of responsiveness to the inhibition of root elongation by the cytokinin BAP and by epi-brassinolide (Supplementary Fig. S2E, F).. . . ABA and auxin regulate transcription from the AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter. To elucidate how AtRAC7/ROP9 expression levels are regulated in the plant, the AtRAC7p-GUS transgenic lines were exposed to different hormonal signals. As can be seen in Fig. 6A, the activity of the AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter was regulated by hormones. Exogenous application of auxin stimulated promoter activity, while ABA was a strong inhibitor. The application of other hormones did not have an effect on the AtRAC7/ROP9p activity (Fig. 6A). The results obtained with the histochemical staining were extended using a transient expression assay in protoplasts, which showed that auxin stimulated the activity of the AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter, while ABA was a strong repressor (Fig. 6B). The dual regulation of the AtRAC7/ROP9 promoter by auxin and ABA is unique among type II RAC/ROPs, as auxin had no effect on the AtRAC10/ROP11 promoter (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online) or the AtRAC8/ROP10 promoter (Zheng et al., 2002), while ABA was a strong repressor of both promoters.. .

PMC3585709	Results. . Loss of SDG2 Impairs Root Growth and Development. Investigation of plant growth revealed that the examined allelic mutants sdg2-1, sdg2-2 and sdg2-3. [39] all exhibit a short-root phenotype (shown for sdg2-3 in Figure 1A). Subsequently we focused on sdg2-3 for more detailed analyses. Starting from the fifth day after germination the sdg2-3 mutant compared to WT showed clear primary root growth retardation, and the difference became increasingly evident along with plant age, e.g the sdg2-3 primary roots reached only about 50% mean length compared to those of WT in 18-day-old plants (Figure 1B). LR formation was also affected in sdg2-3. To the naked eye, WT seedlings produced the first LR at about 9 days of age whereas sdg2-3 seedlings started only after 15 days. The LR number per plant is significantly lower in the mutant than in WT as evidenced from above 10-day-old seedlings (Figure 1C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0056537.g001. Figure 1. .

The reporter line DR5:GUS marks the earliest events associated with LR formation [41], [42]. To investigate SDG2 effects on LR formation in more detail, we introgressed DR5:GUS into sdg2-3 by genetic crosses. Histochemical analysis revealed that DR5:GUS is expressed in all stages and morphologically recognizable LR primordia in sdg2-3 as in WT (Figure 2A, developmental stage according to Malamy and Benfey [43]). Remarkably, we found that the majority of LR primordia from 10-day-old seedlings accumulate at developmental stage I and II in sdg2-3 as compared to WT (Figure 2B). After stage IV LR development was drastically blocked in sdg2-3 (Figure 2B). These observations support our previous idea and further provide detailed information that LR formation in sdg2-3 is primarily inhibited from developmental stage VI on, at a time when a critical mass of cells is reached to form a structured root SCN.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0056537.g002. Figure 2. . Loss of SDG2 distinctively affects different developmental stages of lateral root formation. A,. Developmental stages of lateral root formation. Images was captured after histochemical GUS staining of roots from 10-day-old Col seedlings expressing DR5:GUS. Developmental stage nomenclature was according to Malamy and Benfey [43]. Bar=50 m. B, Relative distribution of developmental stages of lateral root primordia observed in 10-day-old seedlings of the wild-type Col and the mutant sdg2-3. Primordia were counted and examined for developmental stages from at least 20 plants, and the experiments were repeated three times. Mean values of percentage are shown and bars indicate SD.. . . . We further examined SCN organization in the primary roots. Consistent with the short-root phenotype, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) was reduced in sdg2-3 compared to WT (Figure 3A and 3B). A close examination of the root tip revealed that WT roots contain the regular and arc-shaped arrangement of the four layers of starch granule-rich columella cells and a layer of starch granule-lacking columella initial cells located under the QC layer (Figure 3C). In sdg2-3 roots, the columella cells were displayed in disorganized cell layers and starch granules were observed in cells adjacent to QC (Figure 3D), indicating a loss of columella initial cell identity. In addition, expression of the QC specific marker QC25:GUS. [44] was detected at lower levels and in a fewer number of cells in sdg2-3 compared to WT roots (Figure 3C, D). Further propidium iodide (PI) staining and microscopy analysis revealed that, compared with WT (Figure 3E), the sdg2-3 mutant contains a disorganized SCN with reduced number of QC cells, fewer and less recognizable stem cells of stele initials, as well as fewer cortex/endodermis initials, epidermis initials, and columella root cap initials (Figure 3F). The cell size was also largely more variable, with either increased or reduced volume, in each type of cells within SCN of sdg2-3 as compared to WT. As compared to the so far described defects in the primary roots of 6-day-old sdg2-3 seedlings, the primary roots of 14-day-old sdg2-3 seedlings showed similar SCN defects but to a more severe degree (Figure 3H), whereas the regular SCN organization in WT was stably maintained (Figure 3G). It appears that during postembryonic seedling growth the sdg2-3 root SCN gradually loses cell identity and stem cell function, causing root growth arrest.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0056537.g003.

The close-up regions are shown with colorations as described in E and F.. . . . Taken together, our results indicate that SDG2 function is required for SCN establishment for LR development and is critical for stable maintenance of SCN organization and function in primary roots.. . . Auxin Regulation is Partly Disrupted by Loss of SDG2 Function. To gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying the sdg2-3 root SCN defect, we introgressed into sdg2-3 the marker DR5:GFP which reports auxin signaling in single cells [45], [46]. In WT roots expressing DR5:GFP, the GFP signal was detected at high levels in columella cells, columella initial cells and QC cells (Figure 4A). In sdg2-3 roots, the intensity of GFP signal appeared slightly weaker and most importantly the auxin gradient and maximum in QC were lost; almost no GFP signal could be detected at QC position (Figure 4B). Next, we performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis for auxin-related genes to compare their expression in WT and sdg2-3 roots. As shown in Figure 4C, expression of each IAA14, IAA19, IAA29, IAA34, and to a lesser extent of IAA28, was significantly increased whereas expression of IAA2, IAA16 and IAA30 was unchanged in sdg2-3. An increase of expression in sdg2-3 was also observed for the cell cycle inhibitory gene RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED (RBR, Figure 4C). Because RBR and several IAA genes are known to negatively regulate root growth [9], [14], [17], [47], their upregulation is consistent with the root growth suppression phenotype of the sdg2-3 mutant. Nevertheless, because SDG2 acts as an activator of gene transcription [39], [40], it is likely that the observed gene upregulation is caused indirectly by the sdg2-3 mutation. An auxin-mediated PLETHORA (PLT) pathway is essential for root SCN maintenance [48], consistently the expression of PLT1 (but not PLT2) was reduced in sdg2-3 roots (Figure 4C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0056537.g004. Figure 4. . Loss of SDG2 partially affects auxin regulation in roots. A. and B, Comparison of the expression pattern of DR5:GFP reporter in 5-day-old wild-type Col and the mutant sdg2-3, respectively. Note that auxin gradient maximum in QC visualized by DR5:GFP expression in Col is lost in sdg2-3. Bar=50 m. C, Relative gene expression levels determined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. RNA was prepared from roots of 20-day-old Col or sdg2-3 seedlings. RT-PCR was performed using gene specific primers and normalized using ACTIN2 as reference. Relative expression levels of the indicated genes are shown as mean values from three biological repeats and with Col value setting as 1. Bars indicate SD. D, Effects of exogenous NAA on root elongation of Col and sdg2-3 seedlings. Seeds were germinated and grown on medium containing the indicated concentration of NAA. Root length is shown as a mean value obtained from three independent experiments with each experiment comprising 20 plants. Bar indicates SD. E, Effects of exogenous NAA on lateral root (LR) formation of Col and sdg2-3 seedlings. LR and primordia were counted using the GUS reporter of 10-day-old Col or sdg2-3 seedlings expressing CYCB1;1:GUS. The total number of LR and primordia was divided by root length to report LR formation ability of individual plants. Mean values obtained from three independent experiments and 20 plants per sample per experiment are shown, and bars indicate SD.. . . . We addressed the question as to whether auxin supply would rescue the sdg2-3 mutant phenotype. Root growth was investigated in the presence of various concentrations of exogenous 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). We found that root growth is less responsive to NAA inhibition in sdg2-3 compared to WT (Figure 4D). Nevertheless, in no case sdg2-3 root growth could reach that of WT. To examine LR development in the presence of NAA, we introgressed into sdg2-3 the marker CYCB1;1:GUS, which reports cell division activity and lateral root primordia formation [49], [50] (Supplementary Figure S1). At low concentrations (1 or 10 nM), an NAA effect on LR formation was not evident. However, NAA at 100 nM drastically stimulated LR formation in WT and sdg2-3 (Figure S1 and 4E). In the latter case, the LR and primordia number per root length was still significantly lower in sdg2-3 compared to WT (Figure 4E). Taken together, our data indicate that loss of SDG2 function affects partially auxin regulation but the mutant plants remain responsive to auxin and exogenous auxin supply could not fully rescue the mutant root defects. A slight downregulation of BES1, which encodes a key transcription factor of the BR signaling pathway [51], was observed in sdg2-3 (Figure 4C). However, similar to auxin exogenous brassinolide (BL, a type of bioactive BR) also could not fully rescue the sdg2-3 mutant root defects (Supplementary Figure S2). It appears that SDG2 determines root meristem activity not only through a specific phytohormone-signaling pathway.. . . SDG2 and CAF-1 Synergistically Regulate Root Meristem Activity. CAF-1 regulates histone deposition in chromatin and the loss-of-CAF-1 mutants fas1 and fas2 exhibit multiple defects of root development, including loss of SCN [24], perturbed cell fate at epidermis [21], and compromised LR development [52]. We asked whether SDG2 and CAF-1 act in a same regulatory pathway. To address this question, we generated the sdg2-3 fas2-4 double mutant by genetic crosses between the sdg2-3 and fas2-4 single mutants. The double mutant showed a drastically arrested growth phenotype (Figure 5A). While the sdg2-3 and fas2-4 single mutants showed a similar short-root phenotype, a synergistic effect of sdg2-3 and fas2-4 on root growth inhibition was observed (Figure 5A and 5B). The mean root length of the double mutant sdg2-3 fas2-4 reached to less than 20% of that of fas2-4 at 16 days after germination (Figure 5B). The regular arrangement of the cell layers at RAM was disturbed in fas2-4 (Figure 5C and 5E), which is in agreement with the previous report on another mutant allele fas2-1. [24]. Compared with the single mutant fas2-4 (Figure 5C), the double mutant sdg2-3 fas2-4 showed much fewer starch granules at the root tip cells (Figure 5D). The PI staining and microscopy analysis showed that the typical cellular organization of SCN was totally lost in sdg2-3 fas2-4 (Figure 5F). The severe disorganization and loss of SCN are consistent with the drastic root growth defects observed in sdg2-3 fas2-4. The synergistic effect of sdg2-3 and fas2-4 indicates that SDG2 and CAF-1 act in genetically parallel pathways and they are independently required for the maintenance of root SCN organization and stem cell activity.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0056537.g005. Figure 5. . Loss of SDG2 synergistically enhances growth defects of the CAF1 loss-of-function mutant fas2-4.

SDG2 is Involved in Global H3K4me3 Deposition in Root Cells and in the Maintenance of Genome Integrity. Finally, we addressed the questions whether SDG2 is required for H3K4me3 deposition in specific root cells and whether it affects genome integrity. Previous western blot analyses have shown that H3K4m3 level is reduced in sdg2 mutant plants [39], [40]. We analyzed H3K4me3 levels in individual cells by whole-mount root immunofluorescence [53]. In WT roots, a strong H3K4me3 signal was detected in the nuclei of all cells except for stele cells which showed a weak H3K4me3 signal (Figure 6). In sdg2-3 roots, the H3K4me3 signal was drastically reduced, with only a small number of cells showing clear visible immunofluorescence (Figure 6). Most remarkably, root SCN cells and in particular QC cells showed strong H3K4me3 immunostaining in WT but a very weak signal in sdg2-3 (Figure 6). These observations demonstrate that SDG2 is a H3K4-methyltransferase required for global H3K4me3 deposition in root cells, and that impaired H3K4me3 deposition correlates with interrupted stem cell function in the sdg2-3 mutant root SCN.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0056537.g006. Figure 6. . Loss of SDG2 drastically reduces nuclear H3K4me3 levels in root cells.. Whole-mount root immunofluorescence staining was performed using an antibody specifically recognizing H3K4me3. Panels from left to right subsequently show confocal images of DAPI, H3K4me3 and merged signals. Close-up images show regions around the root stem cell niche with the QC cells circled. Bar=50 m.. . . . Dynamic chromatin and stringent protection of genome integrity are important features of plant SCN. Indeed, histone chaperone (CAF-1, NRPs or ASF1) mutants exhibiting root growth defects also show increased DNA damage [25], [26], [54], [55]. We performed comet assay to investigate the level of DNA damage in WT and mutants sdg2-3, fas2-4 and sdg2-3 fas2-4 seedlings. Figure 7A shows typical nuclei comets observed in WT and mutants. As shown in Figure 7B, the percentage of DNA in comet tails was slightly increased in sdg2-3 and fas2-4 seedlings compared to that of WT. In the sdg2-3 fas2-4 double mutant, the DNA damage level was drastically enhanced (Figure 7B), indicating a synergistic role of SDG2 and CAF-1 in the protection of genome integrity. Consistent with increased levels of DNA damage, several genes involved in DNA repair (including RAD51, RAD51c, RAD54 and PARP1) were activated in the mutants (Figure 7C). The sdg2-3 fas2-4 double mutant behaved relatively similar to the single mutants in DNA repair gene activation (Figure 7C), indicating that the observed gene activation is not quantitatively correlated with DNA damage levels. Finally, we investigated telomere length in WT, sdg2-3, fas2-4 and sdg2-3 fas2-4. Consistent with previous reports [55], [56], fas2-4 caused telomere shortening (Figure 7D). In contrast, sdg2-3 had no detectable effect on telomere length (Figure 7D). These results indicate that SDG2 differs from CAF-1 in regulating genome integrity and chromatin function.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0056537.g007. Figure 7. . Loss of SDG2 synergistically enhances the CAF1 loss-of-function mutant fas2-4 in causing genome DNA damage but not telomere shortening..

PMC3824207	Results. . Homozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants are viable but exhibit defects in vegetative and reproductive development. It was previously shown that approximately 25% of the seed in siliques of heterozygous ctf7-1 plants (ctf7-1/+) exhibit defects in zygote and embryo development including arrest by the early globular stage (Jiang et al., 2010), suggesting that inactivation of Arabidopsis CTF7 results in embryo lethality. During the analysis of segregating populations of progeny of the ctf7-1/+ (SALK_059500) and ctf7-2/+ (SAIL_1214G06) T-DNA lines (Jiang et al., 2010; Figure 1a), we identified several slow-growing dwarf plants (Figure 1b). At about the same time analysis of the subcellular localization of AtCTF7 in Arabidopsis protoplasts indicated that AtCTF7 localizes to the nucleus (Figure 1c), a result that is in agreement with the hypothesis that Arabidopsis CTF7 is an essential nuclear protein required for growth (Jiang et al., 2010). Indeed, genotyping indicated that dwarf plants were homozygous for the T-DNA insert and segregated at a very low frequency (below 4%), a rate that deviated significantly from a 1:3 Mendelian ratio (Figure 1d). The phenotypes of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 homozygous mutants are indistinguishable, therefore it was decided to focus efforts on the characterization of ctf7-1, which had been successfully complemented using the full genomic sequence of CTF7/ECO1, plus its native promoter (Jiang et al., 2010). This line is referred to as the ctf7-1 complementation line (Com) in this paper. Quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) showed that plants homozygous for either ctf7-1 (ctf7-1 plants) or ctf7-2 (ctf7-2 plants) contain <20% of wild-type (WT) CTF7 mRNA levels corresponding to exon 5, located downstream of the corresponding T-DNA inserts (Figure 1e). Amplification of CTF7 cDNA with primers spanning the T-DNA insert was not possible in ctf7-1 plants, suggesting that the ctf7-1 mutation gives rise to truncated versions of the transcript, a situation previously observed in mutations for human ESCO2 (Vega et al., 2005).. . Figure 1. . Homozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants are dwarf and exhibit male sterility.. (a) The diagram shows genomic organization and T-DNA insertion sites in the Arabidopsis CTF7 locus. Dark boxes represent exons. The primer sets used for genotyping of both T-DNA lines (59LP, 59RP and LBP1.3 for ctf7-1; 12LP, 12RP and LB1 for ctf7-2) and quantitative real-time PCR (1F, 1R, 2F 2R, 3F and 3R) are indicated.. (b) Homozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants are dwarf and fail to develop mature siliques; however, transformation of ctf7-1 heterozygous plants with the full genomic sequence of CTF7/ECO1 allowed normal development in complementation homozygotes (Com).. (c) The Arabidopsis CTF7/ECO1 protein co-localized with the ERF4 nuclear marker in leaf protoplasts.. (d) Less than 4% of the progeny of self-pollinated heterozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 (ctf7-1/+, ctf7-2/+) plants were homozygous (ctf7-1, ctf7-2). Segregation of progeny for both T-DNA alleles was non-Mendelian (not 1:3), and the respective P-values for the chi square test (with two degrees of freedom) were highly significant, suggesting serious developmental defects.. (e) Quantitative real-time PCR experiments with primers complementary to exons 3, 4 and 5, which flank the T-DNA inserts in ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 indicated a significant reduction in CTF7/ECO1 expression downstream of the respective T-DNA insert, while the ctf7-1 complementation line (Com) showed values similar to wild type (WT). Results are shown as means  SD (n = 3) from three biological samples. Asterisks represent significant differences (*P < 0.5, **P < 0.01; Student's t-test) relative to WT.. (f) After anthesis, free pollen grains were easily identifiable on the surface of WT stigma, but not on ctf7-1. Distribution of the petals, sepals and anthers was also affected in ctf7-1 flowers.. (g) Aniline blue-stained self- and reciprocal-pollinated pistils showed normal elongation of pollen tubes from WT, ctf7-1 heterozygous (ctf7-1/+), and the ctf7-1 complementation line (Com) inside wild-type and ctf7-1 pistils, but no seed was recovered in the latter. No elongating pollen tubes were found inside either WT or ctf7-1 pistils after pollination with ctf7-1 pollen grains.. (h) Compared with the WT, siliques of heterozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants contained a higher percentage of defective/aborted seeds. Nevertheless, ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants only produced immature siliques without normal seeds.. (i) Counts of seeds per silique indicate recovery of seed development in the ctf7-1 complementation line (Com), while ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 homozygotes show complete sterility. Scale bars = 1 cm for (b), 10 mum for (c), 0.5 mm for (f) and (h), 0.25 mm for (g).. . . . Developmental defects are widespread in ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 seedlings, including defects in the distribution of leaves on the stem (e.g. phyllotaxy). In the WT all leaves are arranged in a spiral, while in ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 this arrangement shows modifications, including additional basal leaves and clusters of modified, small rosette leaves (Figure S1a). Defects in root development were also observed, including reduction in the length of the elongation zone and root swelling (Figure S1b).. The morphology of ctf7-1 flowers was also abnormal, with enlarged papillae, defective anthers and a very limited amount of pollen (Figure 1f). Crossing experiments showed that mutant stigmas allowed the germination of WT pollen, but no mature siliques were recovered after pollination, suggesting that both male and female gametophytes are defective in ctf7-1 (Figure 1g). No defects were observed in the germination of pollen from the ctf7-1 complementation line or ctf7-1/+ plants (Figure 1g), suggesting that ctf7-1 heterozygous plants are not defective in the development of mature microspores.. Unlike heterozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants, mature siliques of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants were unable to develop viable seeds (Figures 1h,i). Approximately 22% of the ctf7-1/+ seed reaches full size but the embryos arrest by the globular stage (Jiang et al., 2010); however, in ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 all seeds are developmentally arrested before cellularization of the endosperm (Figure 1h). Analysis of emasculated flowers suggested that unlike the case in WT siliques, unfertilized ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 ovules degrade within 2 days of emasculation of the anthers (Figure S1c).. . . CTF7/ECO1 is essential for microsporogenesis. Reciprocal pollination experiments showed that ctf7-1 pollen is defective. Alexander staining revealed a reduction in the size and number of viable pollen grains in ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 anthers, which was not observed in heterozygous anthers. Pollen from ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 is poorly stained due to the lack of cytoplasm (Figure S2a). Staining with fluorescein diacetate (Heslop-Harrison and Heslop-Harrison, 1970) revealed that <6% of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 pollen was viable, as opposed to over 85% in the WT and the complementation and heterozygous lines (ctf7-1/+, ctf7-2/+) (Figure S2b). Also, staining with the DNA dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) indicated that <4% of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 pollen fully develops into mature tricellular pollen (Figure S2c). This prompted us to examine anther and pollen development in ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants.. Anther development in Arabidopsis starts with the formation of bilateral primordia that features locules, and vascular tissue (stages 1-4). Once the primordia are established, archesporial cells within the anther give rise to the endothecium, middle layer, tapetum and pollen mother cells (stage 5). At this stage ctf7-1 anthers already appear smaller than in the WT (Figure 2a). Alterations in microsporogenesis were first observed during stages 6 and 7 when normally meiosis is completed and tetrads are formed. Irregular division of pollen mother cells (stage 6) and the formation of irregular tetrads (stage 7) were observed in ctf7-1 anthers. Anthers in ctf7-1 remained smaller than in WT as development continued, and development of the connective tissue appeared compromised as well. After the release of microspores at stage 8, the anthers of WT and ctf7-1 continued to develop in a similar fashion; the microspores became vacuolated and the tapetum degenerated (stages 9 and 10). However, at stage 11, when microspores normally enter into mitosis and the stomium and septum degrade, ctf7-1 microspores appeared shrunken and there was no noticeable degradation of the stomium and septum. By stage 12, WT anthers contained fully developed tricellular pollen and the anthers were undergoing anthesis. In contrast, most ctf7-1 pollen appeared dead and no opening of the stomium and septum was observed.. . Figure 2. . Anther dehiscence and microsporogenesis are defective in homozygous ctf7-1 plants.. (a) Sections of developing anthers revealed that ctf7-1 had multiple anther developmental defects, including: a reduction in anther size (all stages), unsynchronized release of free tetrads (stage 7), release of irregular microspores (stage 8), lack of pollen mitosis II (stage 10) and failure of the septum (Sn) and stomium (St) to degenerate during anthesis (stage 12).. (b) Left, transmission electron microscopy showed that homozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 pollen grains were smaller, lacked cytoplasm, a vegetative nucleus and sperm cells. Right, staining with DNA dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (bottom) confirmed that ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 pollen lack identifiable vegetative nuclei and sperm cells, unlike wild-type (WT) pollen where vegetative nuclei and sperm cells were clearly observed. T, tapetum; PMC, pollen mother cell; StR, stomium regium, E, epidermis; En, endothecium; ML, middle layer; V, vascular tissue; C, connective tissue; MC, meiotic cell; Td, tetrad; Msp, microspore; Sm, septum; PG, pollen grain; Fb, fiber bands, St, stomium. Scale bars: in (a), 25 mum for stages 5-8 and 50 mum for stages 9-12; in (b) left 50 mum and right 2 mum.. . . . Finally, severe defects in the ultrastructure of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 pollen were observed, including the relative absence of an electron-dense cytoplasm, vegetative nuclei and sperm cells (Figure 2b). These results demonstrate that microsporogenesis and anthesis are defective in ctf7 homozygous mutants.. . . ctf7-1 male meiocytes display defects in chromosome condensation, sister chromatid cohesion and the distribution of cohesin proteins. Based on observations in other systems (Baudrimont et al., 2011; Rudra and Skibbens, 2012), we expected that inactivation of CTF7 should block the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and result in meiotic defects. In order to investigate this possibility we analyzed meiotic chromosome spreads in ctf7-1 plants. Alterations were observed from the earliest stages examined, with the first noticeable difference between ctf7-1 and WT plants being the presence of fewer meiocytes overall throughout meiosis. It is not clear if this is due to the fact that the plants are smaller and less healthy, or if some ctf7-1 microsporocytes arrest and abort prior to meiosis. Some variability was also observed in the phenotypes at different stages of meiosis, with some meiocytes appearing relatively normal; however, most meiocytes shared common phenotypes, which are described below. During pre-leptotene, WT chromosomes showed faint labeling of chromosomes with chromocenters that stain deeply (Ross et al., 1997; Figure S3a for WT), while in ctf7-1 plants no chromosome axes were recognizable and the chromocenters stained very faintly (Figure 3a). Similar to WT, chromosome condensation was observed during leptotene in ctf7-1, although at somewhat reduced levels (Figures 3b and S3b for WT). During zygotene, chromosome alignment was reduced in ctf7-1 (Figures 3c and S3c for WT) and ultimately a mixture of unpaired and unevenly paired chromosomes were observed at pachytene (Figures 3d S3d for WT). During diplotene, a decondensed mass of chromatin was typically observed in ctf7-1; no individual separated chromosomes were visible (Figures 3e and S3e for WT). In contrast to the five bivalents observed in WT at diakinesis (Mercier et al., 2005; Figure S3f for WT) a mixture of uncondensed chromatin, unpaired chromosomes and possibly some bivalents were observed in ctf7-1 (Figure 3f). Beginning at diplotene and diakinesis and continuing through meiosis II, ctf7-1 meiocytes typically appeared less condensed than their WT counterparts. A relatively small number of cells (10%) also appeared to contain extra chromosomes (Figures 3e-g and S3e-g for WT), although it is not clear whether this was caused by defects in chromosome segregation or DNA replication.. . Figure 3. . Homozygous ctf7-1 male meiocytes are defective in chromosome pairing and segregation. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole stained male meiocytes from ctf7-1 plants are shown. A number of alterations are observed.. (a) Pre-leptotene. Chromosomes of ctf7-1 failed to distribute in the nuclear periphery.. (b) Leptotene. Chromosomes failed to form condensed threads and remained in a scattered pattern.. (c) Zygotene. Chromosomes of did not pair and align along the chromosome axis and the recombination foci were poorly observed.. (d) Pachytene. Defects in synapsis with unpaired regions were observed.. (e) Diplotene. Alterations in chromosome condensation with a mixture of unpaired chromosomes.. (f) Diakinesis. A mixture of unpaired chromosomes, univalents and potential chromosome fragments were observed.. (g) Metaphase I. Individual bivalents were not observed. Many meiocytes appeared to contain extra chromosomes.. (h) Anaphase I. Chromosomes failed to segregate properly. Lagging chromosomes and chromosome bridges were observed.. (i) Telophase I. Chromosomes failed to condense properly at the poles, and lagging chromosomes were observed throughout the cell.. (j) Metaphase II. Chromosomes did not align properly at the equatorial planes and remained scattered in the meiocyte.. (k) Anaphase II. Chromosomes failed to segregate properly.. (l) Telophase II. Polyads were observed. Scale bars = 10 mum.. . . . During metaphase I a mass of DNA, possibly chromosomes, congregated at the equatorial plane in ctf7-1; however, individual chromosomes and/or bivalents were difficult to identify (Figures 3g and S3g for WT). In contrast to WT (Figure S3h), chromosomes of ctf7-1 did not segregate evenly at anaphase I, resulting in chromosome bridges, lagging chromosomes and a random distribution of chromosomes (Figure 3h). At telophase I in ctf7-1 individual chromosomes could be identified while the organelle band in the equatorial region of the cells was diffuse and difficult to visualize (Figures 3i and S3i for WT). At metaphase II and anaphase II the chromosomes were irregularly scattered around the cell in ctf7-1 (Figures 3j-k and S3j-k for WT). Finally, at telophase II, nuclear membranes formed around random groups of DNA resulting in polyads in ctf7-1 (Figures 3i and S3i for WT).. To further investigate meiosis, and in particular sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome pairing, in situ hybridization was conducted with the 180 bp centromere (CEN) repeat as a probe (Armstrong et al., 2001) (Data S1). In leptotene, approximately 10 unpaired and well-dispersed CEN signals were observed in WT (11  2, n = 10), while in ctf7-1 irregular CEN signals were typically observed (Figure S4a). By zygotene, the number of CEN signals was reduced to approximately 5  1 (n = 10) in WT. In ctf7-1 roughly double the number of CEN foci (12  1, n = 7) were observed, consistent with a defect in synapsis (Figure S4b). Increased CEN foci (8  1, n = 4), were also observed during pachytene in ctf7-1; in addition the signals were more dispersed and less well defined than in WT, often appearing not as discrete foci but rather as long extended segments. Five easily identifiable CEN foci were observed in WT cells at diakinesis; however, 20 or more CEN signals were typically found in ctf7-1 (Figure S4d).. During late metaphase I/early anaphase I, five pairs of CEN signals (9.1  1, n = 10) were observed in WT, while over 20 CEN signals appeared randomly dispersed around the nucleus in ctf7-1 (Figure S4e). By late anaphase I masses of DNA, some without CEN signals, some with two signals, and clusters of CEN signals were observed in ctf7-1 (Figure S4f). Later in development, ctf7-1 microspores containing varying numbers of CEN signals, some with 20 or more signals, could be observed (Figure S4g). Extra CEN signals were also observed in interphase nuclei of some anther somatic cells of ctf7-1 plants (Figure S4h). In contrast WT microspores and interphase anther cells always contained five and 10 CEN foci, respectively.. We next investigated the loading and distribution of the SYN1 and SMC3 cohesin proteins on chromosomes of ctf7-1 meiocytes. As has been demonstrated previously, SYN1 and SMC3 display similar distribution patterns on WT meiotic chromosomes (Yang et al., 2011a,b; Figures 4 and S5 for WT). Diffuse nuclear labeling is observed at interphase. Beginning at early leptotene and extending into zygotene both proteins decorated the developing WT chromosomal axes. During late zygotene and pachytene the proteins lined the synapsed chromosomes. As meiosis progressed from diplotene to diakinesis the chromosome-associated cohesin signals became progressively weaker and more diffuse.. . Figure 4. . SYN1 exhibits an altered distribution pattern in homozygous ctf7-1 male meiocytes. Merged images of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole stained chromosomes (red) and SYN1 (green) are shown.. (a) Interphase. SYN1 is distributed throughout the nuclei of wild type (WT) male meiocytes; in contrast little or no SYN1 was observed within the nuclei of ctf7-1.. (b) Leptotene. SYN1 decorated WT chromosome filaments as they started to condense, while in ctf7-1 only labeling is weak and diffuse.. (c), (d) Early and late zygotene. SYN1 decorates WT chromosome axes as chromosomes start to synapse.. (e) Pachytene. SYN1 lined the synapsed WT bivalents, but in ctf7-1 the labeling remained weak and diffuse.. (f) Diplotene. SYN1 continues to label WT bivalents, while in ctf7-1 both proteins appear as scattered, punctuate foci.. (g) Diakinesis. Chromosome-associated SYN1 begins to weaken in WT and is absent in ctf7-1 nuclei. Scale bars = 10 mum.. . . . Similar to our observations in the chromosome spreading and CEN fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments, approximately half of the ctf7-1 meiocytes displayed relatively normal SYN1 and SMC3 labeling patterns. However, in most cells the labeling for both proteins was very weak and irregular (Figures 4 and S5). Very little SMC3 and SYN1 signal was present in the nucleoplasm at interphase (Figures 4a and S5a for WT). Diffuse labeling of the chromatin was first observed during leptotene (Figures 4b and S5b for WT), with some labeling of thread-like structures in some cells during early zygotene (Figures 4c and S5c for WT). However, in most cases the SYN1 and SMC3 signals were diffuse and became progressively weaker as meiosis progressed into pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis stages (Figures 4d-g and S5d-g for WT).. . . Several key genes for DNA repair and cell cycle progression are upregulated in ctf7-1 plants. In addition to its critical role in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during DNA replication, CTF7/ECO1 may be involved in DNA repair and cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2010; Lyons and Morgan, 2011). We therefore investigated the effect of the ctf7-1 mutation on the expression of a number of genes required for DNA repair and cell cycle progression. A pathway analysis using AraNet (Lee et al., 2010) suggested a strong functional linkage for these genes (P = 1.054  10-82). The relative expression levels of the selected genes were measured in triplicate through QPCR. As shown in Figure 5, large and statistically significant increases (greater than four-fold) in transcript levels were observed for several genes in ctf7-1 plants, including: ATM (a kinase), BRCA1 (a ubiquitin ligase), PARP2 (a polymerase), RAD51 (a gene involved in homology-dependent DNA repair), CYCB1;1 (a G2/M checkpoint gene) and TOPOII-alpha (a topoisomerase) (Xie and Lam, 1994; Garcia et al., 2003; Preuss and Britt, 2003; Takahashi et al., 2010; Thomson and Guerra-Rebollo, 2010). Smaller increases (approximately two-fold) were observed for SMC5, SMC6B and SRS2 (a helicase) (Ira et al., 2003; Watanabe et al., 2009), while no significant change was observed for ATR (a kinase involved in single-strand break repair) (Yoshiyama et al., 2009), the M-phase checkpoint genes MAD2 and NQK1 (Takahashi et al., 2010) and the gene CDKA1, which regulates the transition from mitosis to endocycle (Dissmeyer et al., 2007). Expression of other topoisomerases was not detected in either WT or ctf7-1 samples, including TOPOI-alpha, and TOPOI-beta (Takahashi et al., 2002).. . Figure 5. . DNA-repair genes are upregulated in leaf tissue of ctf7-1.. Complementary DNAs from 1-week-old wild-type (WT) and ctf7-1 seedlings were generated and used in quantitative real-time PCR. Transcript levels of ATM, PARP2, BRCA1, RAD51, SMC5, TOPOII-alpha and CYCB1;1 are elevated in ctf7-1. Data are shown as means  SD (n = 3) from three biological samples. Asterisks represent significant differences (*P < 0.5, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; Student's t-test) relative to WT.. . . . Given the developmental defects observed in ctf7-1 meiocytes the transcript level of highly expressed meiotic genes (Yang et al., 2011b) was measured by QPCR as well. As shown in Figure 6, statistically significant increases in transcript levels were observed for ATM and ATR, BRCA2B, RAD51C, DMC1, SMC1 and SMC3, and CDC45, a gene that codes for an S-phase licensing factor and is required for meiosis (Stevens et al., 2004). No significant increase was observed for the mitotic checkpoint gene BUB1.3. Expression of several other genes was not detected, including SRS2, mitotic topoisomerases TOPOII-alpha, TOPOI-alpha, TOPOI-beta (Takahashi et al., 2002), meiotic TOPO III-alpha (Hartung et al., 2008) or endoreplication factor MYB3R4 (Takahashi et al., 2010).. . Figure 6. . DNA recombination and canonical cohesin subunit genes are upregulated in meiocytes of ctf7-1.. Complementary DNAs were isolated and amplified from ctf7-1 seedlings and used in quantitative real-time PCR. Transcript levels of ATM, ATR, RAD51C, BRCA2B, DMC1, SMC1, SMC3 and CDC45 are elevated in ctf7-1. Data are shown as means  SD (n = 3) from three biological samples. Asterisks represent significant differences (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; Student's t-test) relative to wild type (WT).. . . . The ability of ctf7-1 plants to repair DNA double breaks was tested using the comet assay (Kozak et al., 2009) (Data S2), which has been employed in Arabidopsis mutants with defects in either chromosome cohesion or DNA repair proteins (Takahashi et al., 2010). Seven-day-old WT and ctf7-1 seedlings were exposed to a bleomycin solution (50 mug ml-1) for 1 h and the percentage of DNA present in nuclei tails after recovery times of 0, 30 and 60 min was used to estimate the level of double-strand breaks remaining in each sample (Figure S6). In WT most double-strand breaks were repaired after 30 min and only approximately 29% remained after 1 h. In contrast approximately 79% of all double-strand breaks remained unrepaired after 1 h in ctf7-1 plants, indicating that CTF7/ECO1 is required for DNA repair in Arabidopsis.. . . ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants are defective in mitotic cell cycle progression. The extreme dwarf phenotype of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants suggested that, similar to the situation in yeast (Moldovan et al., 2006), Arabidopsis CTF7 plays an important role in cell cycle progression. To determine if ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 cells show cell cycle arrest, we analyzed the morphology and density of pavement and stomata cells in the first true leaves of 7-day-old seedlings by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM). In WT, pavement and stomata cells were small (Figure 7a), developed at a density of 1070 and 590 cells mm-2 (Figure 7b) and covered an approximate area of 892 mum2 (for pavement cells) and 88.0 mum2 (for stomata) (Figure 7c). Similar values were observed for the ctf7-1 complementation line (Com) (Figure 7a,b). In cells of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 there was a significant reduction in the density of both pavement cells (580 cells mm-2), and stomata (250 cells mm-2) (Figure 7b), accompanied by a significant increase in the average area of pavement cells (1300 mum2 per cell) (Figure 7c); however, no change was observed in the area of stomatal cells under cryo-SEM.. . Figure 7. . Leaves of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 mutant seedlings are defective in mitotic cell division.. (a) Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed a dramatic increase in cell size of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 pavement cells (adaxial).. (b) Statistical quantification of average pavement cell area.. (c) Total cell number per 1 mm2 leaf area.. (d) Flow cytometry analyses of leaf cells DNA content (C) showed a significant increase (4C) in ctf7-1 and ctf7-2. Data are shown as means  SD (n = 100 for B and C, and 10 000 for D) from three biological samples. Asterisks represent significant differences (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; Student's t-test) relative to wild type (WT).. . . . Mitotic cell cycle progression was further examined by analyzing the DNA content of leaf cells. Intact nuclei were isolated from the first leaves of 7-day-old plants, followed by flow cytometry. In WT and complementation line samples, approximately 71-73% of all nuclei had a haploid DNA content of 2, 2C, which reflects normal entry into mitosis and cell division (Figure 7d). Approximately 16-17% of WT and complementation line nuclei showed a 4C value, which represents those cells that have completed DNA replication but have not entered the G2/M phase. In contrast, 55-56% of ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 nuclei showed a 4C value (Figure 7d), suggesting a defect in the ability of cells to advance into M-phase after DNA replication.. . . ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 plants are defective in mitotic chromosome segregation. In order to obtain direct evidence of the role of Arabidopsis CTF7/ECO1 in mitotic chromosome segregation, root tips were excised from 2-week-old seedlings corresponding to WT, Com, ctf7-1 and ctf7-2. As observed in Figure 8, it was possible to observe cell division from interphase to telophase. In both WT and Com, 10 chromocenters were observed during interphase (Figure 8a,e), which corresponds to a diploid number of chromosomes, while in ctf7-1 (Figure 8i) and ctf7-2 (Figure 8m) the chromocenters often appeared decondensed and in some cases an excess of 10 chromocenters was observed. During metaphase, WT (Figure 8b) and Com (Figure 8f) cells typically displayed 10 condensed chromosomes; however, chromosomes in cells of ctf7-1 (Figure 8j) and ctf7-2 (Figure 8n) appeared less condensed and irregularly shaped. At anaphase, WT (Figure 8c) and Com (Figure 8g) cells showed even segregation of chromosomes, and individual chromosomes could be recognized, while chromosomes in cells of ctf7-1 (Figure 8k) and ctf7-2 (Figure 8o) looked intertwined and stretched, and condensation was defective. In telophase, WT (Figure 8d) and Com (Figure 8h) cells showed segregation of chromosomes into two well-condensed masses of equal size, but in ctf7-1 (Figure 8l) and ctf7-2 (Figure 8p) chromosome bridges persisted and the chromosomes often recondensed into a single unevenly shaped mass of DNA (Figure 8l,p). In fact chromosome segregation in homozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 mitotic cells is statistically different from WT (P < 0.001, Student's t-test) and shows defective chromosome segregation (Figure 8q). Taken together these results suggest that CTF7/ECO1 plays a critical role in the regulation of chromosome segregation during mitotic cell division.. . Figure 8. . Staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole reveals defective chromosome segregation in homozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 mitotic root tip cells.. Interphase cells in both wild type (WT) (a) and the ctf7-1 complementation line (Com, e) show approximately 10 chromocenters corresponding to a diploid number of chromosomes. In cells of ctf7-1 (i) and ctf7-2 (m) the chromocenters often appeared decondensed and in some instances in excess of 10 chromocenters are observed. In metaphase, WT (b) and Com (f) cells typically show 10 condensed chromosomes; however, chromosomes in cells of ctf7-1 (j) and ctf7-2 (n) appear less condensed and irregularly shaped. In anaphase, WT (c) and Com (g) cells show even segregation of chromosomes, and individual chromosomes can be recognized, while chromosomes in cells of ctf7-1 (k) and ctf7-2 (o) appear intertwined and stretched; condensation is also defective. In telophase, WT (d) and Com (h) cell chromosomes segregate into two well-condensed masses of equal size, but in ctf7-1 (l) and ct7-2 (p) chromosome bridges persist and the chromosomes often recondense into a single unevenly shaped mass of DNA (l, p). Chromosome segregation in homozygous ctf7-1 and ctf7-2 mitotic cells is statistically different from WT and shows defective chromosome segregation (q). Data are shown as means  SD (n = 100) from 40 biological samples. Asterisks represent significant differences (***P < 0.001; Student's t-test) relative to WT. Scale bars = 10 mum..
PMC5114321	Results. . GFP-AtNACK1 localizes to the site of cell plate formation, expands to the parental cell walls, and disappears in living tobacco BY-2 cells. As is the case for tobacco NACK1 (Nishihama et al. 2002), in silico analysis by means of the InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) and COILS programs (Lupas et al. 1991) predicts with high probability the presence of a putative motor domain (amino acids 1-360) and several coiled-coil structures in the carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) half, which is called the stalk region in NACK1, of AtNACK1/HIK (Fig.1a, residues 361-974). In addition to the highly probable coiled-coil structures, a single coiled-coil region is predicted with lower probability in the C-terminal tail (Fig.1a, residues 764-974).Fig.1Domain and motif organizations of AtNACK1. a The probability of coiled-coil formation plotted against the amino acid number for AtNACK1 by using the COIL program and a 28-amino acid prediction window (Lupas et al. 1991). b Schematic representation of wild-type and deletion mutant constructs of AtNACK1/HIK. Predicted domain organization and relevant amino-acid positions for the AtNACK1 protein sequence are indicated in the wild-type schematic diagram. The coding region of the stalk (ST) is divided into three parts (ST-A, ST-B, and ST-C), which were fused to the region corresponding to the predicted motor domain (MD) and designated as AtNACK1:MD-A, MD-AB, MD-AC, and MD-BC. The coding sequence corresponding to each construct was fused to the C-terminus of the sequence of G3GFP or sGFP. . We made the XVE::GFP-AtNACK1 construct, in which the coding sequence for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused in frame to the amino-terminal (N-terminal) coding sequence of AtNACK1/HIK cDNA (Fig.1b). This fusion gene was driven by the estrogen-inducible promoter XVE (Zuo et al. 2000) and introduced into cells of the tobacco cultured-cell line BY-2. We cultured the transformed BY-2 cells in liquid medium containing 0.1M 17-beta-estradiol for 16h to induce expression of GFP-AtNACK1. We observed subcellular localization of GFP-AtNACK1 in the transformed cells (Fig.2), where it appeared in the central region corresponding to the expanding cell plate. The GFP signals disappeared as the formation of cell plates ended, suggesting that AtNACK1 disappears upon the maturation of cell plates. These results are consistent with the pattern of a sharp accumulation of tobacco NACK1 protein seen at the M phase of the cell cycle (Nishihama et al. 2002).Fig.2Subcellular localization patterns of GFP-AtNACK1 during the formation of cell plates in BY-2 cells. BY-2 cells transformed with estradiol-inducible GFP-AtNACK1 were incubated for 16h in the presence of 0.1M 17-beta-estradiol. Living cells expressing GFP-AtNACK1 were observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy to detect fluorescence of sGFP (upper) and recorded as time-lapse micrographs at the indicated times during expansion of the cell plate. Normarski (DIC) and merged images (merged) are shown in the center and lower panels, respectively. Bar 10m. . . . The amino-terminal motor and the carboxyl-terminal region of the stalk of AtNACK1/HIK are required for its localization to the site of cell plate formation. To examine which sequences of AtNACK1/HIK are involved in the localization to the site of cell plate formation, we made a series of deletion constructs of AtNACK1 cDNA (Fig.1b), which contained the DNA sequence corresponding to the full length cDNA (full), the motor domain (MD), the stalk (ST) sequence, the MD-A sequence covering the MD and A regions in ST, the MD-AB sequence covering MD, the A and B regions in ST, the MD-AC sequence covering MD, the A and C regions in ST, and the MD-BC sequence covering the MD and BC regions in ST. Note that the B region contained the predicted binding sites of ANP1 MAPKKKs and the putative CDK phosphorylation sites (Ishikawa et al. 2002; Takahashi et al. 2010). These DNA constructs were fused to the C-terminus sequence of the GFP gene, whose expression was under the control of the constitutive active Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, and the chimeric DNA constructs were introduced into cells of the cultured tobacco cell line BY-2.. We observed GFP signals during cytokinesis in transformed BY-2 cells (Fig.3). In cells expressing GFP-AtNACK1:MD, no GFP signals were observed in either the phragmoplast region or the site of cell plate formation (Fig.3b). Although we also transformed BY-2 cells with the GFP-AtNACK1:ST and obtained some calli, these calli were unable to grow further (data not shown), which might be due to the mislocalization of the motor-less NACK1:ST, because this observation is consistent with the result that the overexpression of the stalk region of tobacco NACK1 prevents NPK1 MAPKKK from locating to the phragmoplast equator and has a dominant-negative effect (Nishihama et al. 2002). Taken together, the motor domain seems to play a critical role in the AtNACK1 localization to the site of cell plate formation, but only the motor domain is not sufficient for its proper localization.Fig.3Subcellular localization of GFP-AtNACK1 and its derivatives during formation of cell plates in BY-2 cells. Expression of indicated constructs of AtNACK1 was controlled under the 35S promoter. Transformed BY-2 cells expressing GFP-AtNACK1 (a), GFP-AtNACK1:MD (b), GFP-AtNACK1:MD-A (c), GFP-AtNACK1:MD-AB (d), GFP-AtNACK1:MD-AC (e), and GFP-AtNACK1:MD-BC (f) were observed by fluorescence microscopy to detect fluorescence of G3GFP (center) during cell plate formation. Nomarski images (DIC) and merged images (merged) are shown in the left and right panels, respectively. Arrowheads indicate the site of expanding cell plates. Bar 20m. . GFP signals were not detected at the site of cell plate formation in the transformed cells with GFP-AtNACK1:MD-A, GFP-AtNACK1:MD-AB, and GFP-AtNACK1:MD-AC (Fig.3c-e). Obvious GFP signals were observed, however, at the cell plate formation site in the transformed BY-2 cells expressing GFP-AtNACK1:MD-BC (Fig.3f). These results indicate that the BC region in ST, in addition to the motor domain of AtNACK1/HIK, is sufficient for the localization of AtNACK1 to the site of cell plate formation, but that only the AB region and the C region when separated from the B region are not sufficient for the appropriate localization. These results also indicate that the A region is not required for its localization to the site of cell plate formation.. . . AtNACK1-GFP fusion does not localize to the site of cell plate formation in the living cells of Arabidopsis roots and causes dominant-negative effects on cytokinesis in Arabidopsis plants. We fused the C-terminal coding sequence of the entire AtNACK1/HIK genomic sequence, which covered the 5-upstream promoter and coding regions, to the N-terminus of the GFP sequence. The genomic sequence we used has the ability to complement the phenotypes of atnack1 mutants (pAtNACK1::genome AtANCK1; Sasabe et al. 2011a). We used this construct to transform the wild-type Arabidopsis plants (Col-0). We observed the GFP signals by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy. By analyzing time-lapse images of living cells in the transgenic plants (Fig.4a), we observed that the signals derived from pAtNACK1::genome AtNACK1-GFP did not localize at the site of cell plate formation, as visualized by staining with FM4-64, but were detected within wide areas corresponding to the whole phragmoplast in transformed root cells. The cell plate stained by FM4-64 in the transgenic Arabidopsis expressing AtNACK1-GFP appeared to expand more slowly than that in non-transgenic Arabidopsis (Fendrych et al. 2010; Kosetsu et al. 2010). These results indicate that the C-terminal GFP fusion of AtNACK1 appears to interfere with its localization to the site of cell plate formation, suggesting that the C-terminal region of AtNACK1/HIK plays an important role in its localization to the site of cell plate formation as well as in the cell plate formation itself.Fig.4Subcellular localization of AtNACK1-GFP during the formation of cell plates in Arabidopsis plants and BY-2 cells, and effects of its expression on the plant phenotypes. a Time-lapse micrographs of AtNACK1-GFP in the living root-tip cell of an Arabidopsis plant that was transformed with genomic AtNACK1-fused GFP.

We observed the phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants transformed with pAtNACK1::genome AtNACK1-GFP (Fig.4b-d). In T2 plants, 6 out of 7 transgenic lines displayed a dwarf phenotype (Fig.4b; 6-72%), although the extent of the phenotype depended on each transgenic line. Epidermal cells in the #1 transgenic line, which displayed the highest proportion (72%) of the most severe dwarf phenotype, exhibited cytokinesis defects with incomplete cell walls (Fig.4c). Although the #8 transgenic plant line did not show dwarfism in T2 plants, the T3 plants homozygously expressing AtNACK1-GFP showed 8% of dwarf phenotypes (Fig.4d, nested image; 4 of 50 seedlings). The dwarf phenotypes might be due to a growth defect of the transgenic plants owing to the mislocalization of AtNACK1-GFP as described above.. . . AtNACK1-GFP localizes to the site of cell plate formation and the wide area outside of the site in BY-2 cells. We also examined subcellular localization of AtNACK1-GFP in BY-2 cells and compared the pattern of its localization with that of the pattern of localization of AtNACK1-GFP in Arabidopsis. We made the XVE::AtNACK1-GFP construct, in which the GFP sequence was fused to the C-terminal coding sequence of AtNACK1 cDNA, and introduced into BY-2 cells. We cultured the transformed BY-2 cells in liquid medium containing 0.1M estradiol for 16h to induce expression of AtNACK1-GFP. As compared with the GFP signal derived from XVE::GFP-AtNACK1 (Fig.4e), those derived from XVE::AtNACK1-GFP were detected in the wide regions around the site of cell plate formation (Fig.4f, g), which might have corresponded to the phragmoplast area. These results indicate that the C-terminal GFP fusion of AtNACK1 appears to disturb its localization to the site of cell plate formation in BY-2 cells as well as in Arabidopsis plants. We have also made the AtNACK1-GFP construct with a constitutive active CaMV 35S promoter and have attempted to analyze the subcellular localization of AtNACK1-GFP in tobacco BY-2 cells. Although we obtained transformed BY-2 cells, we failed to detect GFP signals..
PMC4507779	Results. . Positioning of LRP is altered in cytokinin-deficient plants. First, LR spacing in cytokinin-deficient 35S:CKX1 transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings (Werner et al., 2003) was compared with acr4 mutant seedlings known to have a LR positioning defect (De Smet et al., 2008) and wild-type seedlings under the same growth conditions. In wild-type roots almost no LRP or emerged LRs initiated from immediately adjacent or opposite sites (Fig. 1A,B). Among 373 LRI events in 15 wild-type roots, only five LRP (1.30.6%) were located in immediate proximity (Fig. 1J). In contrast, in acr4 mutant plants LRP initiated from adjacent or opposite sites (Fig. 1C,D), which is consistent with previous results (De Smet et al., 2008). In total, 39 LRP out of 348 LRI events (11.01.9%) were formed from these aberrant positions (Fig. 1J). Similarly, 76 LRP out of 811 LRI events (9.10.9%) were located immediately adjacent or opposite to each other in 35S:CKX1 plants (Fig. 1J). There was phenotypic variability in the defective spacing pattern. In some instances stretches of several PCs showed cell division activity (Fig. 1E) and closely spaced LRP were formed either on the longitudinal axis (Fig. 1F) or on the opposite side of the axis (Fig. 1G). Closely spaced LRP mostly belonged to the same developmental stage or differed by just one stage (according to Malamy and Benfey, 1997), indicating that they were induced at a similar time (Fig. 1F,G). Albeit less frequent, cytokinin-deficient plants also sometimes formed clusters of closely spaced LRP of different growth stages (Fig. 1H). Rarely, several closely spaced LRP emerged and appeared as clustered LRs (Fig. 1I). However, the proportion of emerged neighbouring LRs was low, suggesting that most of the LRP at aberrant positions arrest during development and do not contribute much to the overall root architecture. Notably, the primary roots of acr4 mutants were only about 15% shorter than those of wild type (data not shown) and those of 35S:CKX1 transgenic plants were even longer (Werner et al., 2003), indicating that the shorter distance between LRP is not correlated with the length of the primary root.. . Fig. 1.. . LR spacing is altered in cytokinin-deficient plants. (A-I) No proximal LRP and LRs were observed in wild type (A, B) whereas LRP and LRs in close proximity were observed in acr4 (C, D) and 35S:CKX1 (E-I). Red asterisks indicate borders of LRP or emerged LRs. (J) Proportion of LRP separated by different PC number in 11-d-old wild-type, acr4, and cytokinin-deficient 35S:CKX1 plants. n (number of roots analysed) = 15. (K) Expression of the CycB1;1:GUS and DR5:GUS marker genes indicates division of neighbouring PCs in 35S:CKX1 plants but not in wild-type plants and a normal auxin pattern in aberrantly positioned LRP and LRs.

Error bars indicate SEM (this figure is available in colour at JXB online).. . . . To study the reach of defective LRP positioning, the percentage of LRP separated by zero, one, or up to three PCs was determined in roots of wild-type, acr4, and 35S:CKX1 plants (Fig. 1J). The largest difference between wild type and the mutants was found for a distance of zero PCs, i.e. directly neighbouring cells, and an increased frequency was also observed in the mutants for a LRP distance of up to three PCs (Fig. 1J). In wild type, a total of 21.5% of the LRP had a neighbouring LRP within this distance, while it was 48.0% and 50.0% for acr4 and 35S:CKX1, respectively. All other LRPs had a neighbouring LRP at a larger distance. Together, the LR spacing defects in acr4 mutants and 35S:CKX1 plants occurred at a similar frequency and with a similar spatial distribution.. In order to analyse cell division activity during LRP formation, expression of the CycB1;1:GUS reporter marking dividing LRFCs (Casimoro et al., 2001) was compared between wild type and cytokinin-deficient plants. In wild type, GUS staining was observed only in the LRFCs but not in the neighbouring PCs. In contrast, in cytokinin-deficient roots neighbouring PCs could be activated simultaneously to become LRFCs, which is indicated by the cell division activity following their specification (Fig. 1K). To investigate whether closely spaced LRP establish a normal auxin pattern, the auxin reporter DR5:GUS was analysed in the 35S:CKX1 background. DR5:GUS marked founder cells and subsequent primordium formation in both wild type and neighbouring LRPs in 35S:CKX1 plants and displayed similar expression patterns (Fig. 1K). Apparently closely spaced LRP establish a normal cellular division and auxin pattern and lack growth defects seen in other mutants showing spatially altered LRI (Hofhuis et al., 2013).. . . Cytokinin metabolism and signalling genes are involved in the positioning of LRP. The LR spacing phenotype of cytokinin-deficient plants suggests that the normally occuring inhibition of LRP formation in the vicinity of a LRP that has started to form is abolished. In order to study the spatial organization of the signal generation mediating this inhibition, expression patterns and functions of cytokinin synthesis genes were analysed. The expression of several cytokinin synthesis genes, both IPT and LOG genes, as well as of cytokinin-degrading CKX genes has been reported to occur during LR formation (Werner et al., 2003; Miyawaki et al., 2004; Takei et al., 2004b; Kuroha et al., 2009; Parizot et al., 2010; Kiba et al., 2013). The spatio-temporal expression pattern of these genes during different stages of LR formation was studied in more detail because it has been reported in most cases only for one or two stages. A particularly intriguing expression pattern was shown by the IPT5, LOG4, and CKX6 genes, which were switched on very early during formation of LRP in stage I similar to DR5:GUS (Figs 1K and 2; Supplementary Fig. S1). During further LRP development IPT5 and LOG4 were expressed in most cells until emergence. In the emerged LR the expression of IPT5 became confined to the root tip and LOG4 was strongly expressed in provascular tissue and the LR meristem (Fig. 2). In contrast, CKX6 expression was observed in the vasculature and only in stage I LRP but not in the following stages (Figure S1). The pIPT3:GFP and pIPT7:GFP reporter did not show activity during early LR development. IPT3 was expressed in the PCs and the basal stele of young LRs, IPT7:GFP expression was confined principally to the vascular stele of the primary root (Fig. 2). Expression of reporter genes for LOG3, CKX1 and CKX5 became only visible in the vasculature and at the basis of the emerged LR (Supplementary Fig. S1). Also for pCYP735A2:GUS, no expression was seen in the primordium itself but there was a variable pattern and strength of expression in PCs and vascular tissue on either side of the existing primordia (Fig. 2). The expression pattern of pCYP735A1:GUS could not be analysed because of its low expression level (Takei et al., 2004a. ; Kiba et al., 2013). The gene expression analysis showed a specific pattern of cytokinin synthesis gene expression and pointed to the IPT5 and LOG4 genes as being possibly particularly relevant in creating a source of cytokinin in the young primordia. Their expression could establish an inhibitory field preventing LRI in neighbouring cells.. . Fig. 2.. . Spatio-temporal expression of selected cytokinin synthesis genes during LR development. A developmental sequence of the expression pattern of promoters of cytokinin metabolism genes is shown from left to right starting with stage I LRP to emerged LR. The respective promoter is indicated in the upper left corner of each picture series. Three-day-old seedlings were stained with GUS reaction buffer for 1h and cleared. GFP expression was analysed in 5-d-old seedlings using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Part of the root staining pattern reporting expression of the cytokinin metabolism genes shown here have been published before (Werner et al., 2003; Takei et al., 2004b. ; Kuroha et al., 2009; Kiba et al., 2013). Scale bars is 50 muM (this figure is available in colour at JXB online).. . . . To further investigate the role of cytokinin synthesis genes in LR positioning, a detailed analysis was performed using single and higher order mutants. Single ipt mutants showed only weak (ipt3, ipt5) or no (ipt7) LRP positioning defects (Fig. 3A). The double mutants ipt3 5 and ipt3 7 showed an increased proportion of abnormally positioned LRP compared to wild type but only the difference seen for ipt3 5 was statistically significant. The proportion of misplaced LRP increased further to 13.62.0% (57 out of 416 LRP in 12 roots) in ipt3 5 7 roots (Fig. 3A). The misplaced LR in ipt mutants displayed a similar pattern to that shown in 35S:CKX1 plants and included different developmental stages ranging from LRP to emerging LR (Supplementary Fig. S2). The log4 mutant also exhibited LR spacing defects (7.01.4%) (Fig. 3A).. . Fig. 3.. . A decrease in cytokinin content or signalling increases the frequency of defects in positioning of LRP. (A) Percentage of LRP positioned immediately adjacent to each other in 11-d-old seedlings of cytokinin-synthesis mutants. n (number of roots analysed) = 12-16. (B) Proportion of LRP separated by zero to three PCs in wild type (WT; n = 30) and the cytokinin-synthesis mutants ipt3 5 7 and log4. n = 15-17. (C) Percentage of LRP positioned immediately adjacent to each other in 11-d-old seedlings of cytokinin-signalling mutants. n = 11-14. Significance of differences in (A-C) was analysed by two-tailed Students t-test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Error bars indicate SEM.. . . . Single and double mutants of CYP735A genes also showed an abnormal LRP positioning phenotype. The cyp735a1 and cyp735a2 single mutant phenotypes were enhanced in the cyp735a1 a2 double mutant, with 13.93.0% of the LRI events located in the immediate vicinity (Fig. 3A). This double mutant contained less than 5% of wild-type levels of tZ-type cytokinins but a 2-fold higher level of iP-type cytokinins (Kiba et al., 2013). Thus the mutant phenotype indicates a particular functional relevance of tZ in regulating LRP spacing.. The LRP spacing defect phenotype was further analysed by counting the PC number between two closely positioned LRP in ipt3 5 7 and log4 roots compared to wild type. Fig. 3B shows that both cytokinin-synthesis mutants had a higher proportion of LRP separated by zero to three PCs (44.5% for ipt3 5 7 and 47.9% for log4) as compared to wild type (22.8%). The largest difference in LRP specification between the cytokinin-synthesis mutants and the wild type was immediately adjacent to an already initiated LR and then declined gradually, showing an almost similar frequency at a distance of three PCs (Fig. 3B). This gradient of activity could possibly be due to a cytokinin flow originating in young LRP and caused by the combined activities of IPT5 and LOG4 that primarily affect the immediately adjacent cells (Fig. 2A). Fig. 4 shows that reduced cytokinin synthesis in and around LRP affects the cytokinin output signal in the zone of high cytokinin sensitivity surrounding LRP (Bielach et al., 2012). The signal of the cytokinin reporter TCSn:GFP (Zrcher et al., 2013) in wild type was high in cells neighbouring LRP but lower in these cells in roots of the cytokinin-synthesis mutant ipt3 5 7. This is consistent with a lower inhibitory activity of cytokinin on LR initiation in these cells.. . Fig. 4.. . Expression of TCSn:GFP during LR development. Activity of cytokinin as visualized by TCSn:GFP is high in PCs on either side of LRP in wild-type plants. TCSn:GFP expression is reduced in PCs adjacent to LRP of the cytokinin-deficient ipt3 5 7 mutant. White asterisks indicate borders of LRP or emerged LRs. Scale bar is 100 M (this figure is available in colour at JXB online).. . . . To investigate whether the cytokinin receptor genes and response regulator genes are involved in the regulation of LR spacing, the double receptor mutants and type-B ARR mutants were analysed. A higher percentage of misplaced LRP as compared to wild type was formed in all three double receptor mutants, but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 3C). Among the type-B response regulator genes, the arr1 12 (6.11.6%) and arr10 12 (6.82.2%) double mutants showed significantly increased spacing defects compared to wild type (Fig. 3C). These data are consistent with the high degree of functional redundancy of cytokinin receptors and type-B ARR genes in regulating LR development (Chang et al., 2013) and demonstrate that perception and transmission of the cytokinin signal is important to regulate LR spacing.. . . . ACR4 expression is reduced in roots of cytokinin-deficient plants and the cytokinin status is lowered in acr4 mutants. Because both the cytokinin and ACR4 pathways prevent neighbouring PCs from LRI, the relationship between these pathways was investigated. The expression of ACR4 in roots of 11-d-old seedlings of cytokinin-synthesis and -signalling mutants was analysed. Fig. 5A shows that the abundance of the ACR4 transcripts was lower in the roots of most plants with a reduced cytokinin status. The strongest reduction of ACR4 transcript abundance (~60% reduction compared to wild type) was noted in ipt3 5 7 triple mutants. Further, in wild type, pACR4-driven H2B:YFP expression was observed in the LRP while fluorescence of YFP was hardly detectable in the cytokinin-deficient 35S:CKX1 and ipt3 5 7 background (Fig. 5B). However, ACR4 transcript analysis at different time points following exogenous addition of cytokinin did not reveal a strong influence of cytokinin on the steady-state level of ACR4 mRNA (Brenner et al., 2012 and data not shown). Taken together, this shows that ACR4 expression is reduced in cytokinin-deficient plants but that ACR4 is not a primary cytokinin response gene. The reduced LR spacing in cytokinin-deficient plants might be partly accomplished through lowered expression of ACR4.. . Fig. 5.. . Interaction between the cytokinin and ACR4 signalling pathways on gene expression level. (A) ACR4 expression analysis by qPCR in the roots of 11-d-old different cytokinin-deficient seedlings. (B) ACR4::H2B:YFP expression (green signals) is visible in LRP of wild type (WT) but is absent in cytokinin-deficient plants. Scale bar is 20 M. (C) GLV gene expression analysis by qPCR in the roots of 11-d-old different cytokinin-deficient seedlings. (D) Transcript profiles of cytokinin metabolism and signalling genes in roots of 11-d-old acr4 single and double mutants. Error bars represent SEM from three (A) or two (C, D) biological replicates. Each biological replicate contained roots from at least six individual plants. In all cases the expression level of wild type was set to 1 and the statistical significance of differences of expression values in mutants compared to wild type was determined by Students t-test (*P < 0.05) (this figure is available in colour at JXB online).. . . . The transcript levels of the GLV genes, which encode small signalling peptides that are the putative ligands of ACR4 (Meng et al., 2012; Fernandez et al., 2013), were then investigated. The expression of all five GLV genes that are specifically expressed during early stages of LR development (Fernandez et al., 2013) showed a lower expression in the roots of plants with a globally reduced cytokinin status (Fig. 5C), even though these form more LRP. The strongest reduction of GLV gene transcript levels (~70-80% as compared to wild type) was again observed in ipt3 5 7 triple mutant plants, similar to the strong reduction of ACR4 (Fig. 5A,C). However, in contrast, the cyp735a double mutant and the log4 mutant did not display strong changes of GLV gene expression compared to wild type. It could be that changes in tZ do not affect GLV gene expression and that the local changes of the cytokinin content expected in log4 mutants are diluted in whole root extracts. In any case, cytokinin appears to positively regulate GLV gene expression in roots. However, whether this results in altered ACR4 activity that affects LRI remains to be shown.. The transcript profiles of cytokinin genes were analysed by qPCR in the roots of acr4 mutants, and in double mutants combining acr4 with mutant alleles of two other family members, CRR2 and CRR4 (De Smet et al., 2008). The analysis showed significantly changed transcript levels for several of the cytokinin genes. IPT3 and IPT5 were both downregulated in the acr4 mutants while CKX1 and CKX6 were upregulated (Fig. 5D). Similarly, several genes encoding cytokinin signalling factors were downregulated, including the receptor gene AHK3 and the type-B ARR genes ARR1 and ARR12. Together, the altered expression of cytokinin genes suggests a lower cytokinin status in acr4 mutant roots. Interestingly, CYP735A2 was strongly upregulated in the acr4 ccr2 and acr4 crr4 double mutants, indicating a negative control of the ACR4 system on the synthesis of tZ-type cytokinins (Fig. 5D).. . . Cytokinin and ACR4 inhibit the initiation of neighbouring PCs through independent non-hierarchical pathways. To further investigate whether cytokinin and ACR4 control the positioning of LR through the same or separate pathways, the LR spacing phenotype of the acr4 35S:CKX1 hybrid seedlings was compared to the parental phenotypes. The hybrid acr4 35S:CKX1 plants displayed a much higher percentage of aberrantly positioned LRP (20.02.9%) than both parents (Fig. 6A). This largely additive effect suggests that cytokinin and ACR4 function at least partly in separate pathways in preventing neighbouring PCs from LRI. Consistently, addition of cytokinin to the growth medium had only a weak effect on the LR spacing defect in acr4 mutants, while it did lower the LR spacing defect by 67% in 35S:CKX1 seedlings (Fig. 6B).. . Fig. 6.. . Effects of a lowered cytokinin status and ACR4 mutation on LR spacing are additive.

PMC3748079	Results. . Efficient Incorporation of Stable Isotope Labelled Amino Acids. The major problem with the application of SILAC to plants has been limited incorporation of stable-isotope-containing amino acids, thought to be due to plants being autotrophic. Indeed, successful SILAC in Chlamydomonas was achieved by generating an arginine auxotrophic mutant [21]. To establish SILAC in plants, we therefore examined whether mutants in the arginine and lysine synthesis pathways would increase the efficiency of labelling with stable isoptope-containing Arg and Lys. The L-arginine and L-lysine biosynthesis pathways in Arabidopsis are well understood [24], [25]. We investigated four (SALK_042885 for At3g53580, SALK_095812 for At3g53580, SALK_044782 for At4g33680, CATMA4a35440 for At4g33680) and six (SALK_047105 for At1g29900, SALK_038130 for At4g24830, SALK_070991 for At4g37670, SALK_070983 for At4g37670, SALK_138081 for At2g19940, SALK_085035 for At2g22910) knock-out mutants (T-DNA insertions) in genes in the lysine and arginine biosynthetic pathways, respectively. Some mutant lines showed poor growth phenotypes under normal conditions and some of the arginine pathway mutants had reduced levels of arginine in preliminary HPLC analyses (results not shown). However, in SILAC experiments, none of the mutants showed significantly higher levels of heavy arginine and lysine incorporation when compared to wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings (results not shown) and subsequent experiments were therefore performed with wild-type plants. We also attempted to label Arabidopsis cell cultures but obtained lower incorporation consistent with previous studies [19], [20].. Seedlings were germinated on basal medium with minimal organics containing 13C6-arginine and 4H2-lysine and grown for up to 23 days, with the medium containing isotope-labelled amino acids being changed every two days throughout the growth period (Figure 1A-C). Shoot material from the heavy-isotope labelled (heavy) and unlabelled (light) seedlings was harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total protein was extracted and equal amounts of protein from heavy and light shoot material were combined and size fractionated by SDS-PAGE and treated with trypsin. Peptides were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis on a LTQ-Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific); peptide data were quantified and proteins identified against the Uniprot Arabidopsis thaliana database (updated September 2012) using MaxQuant. The efficiency of label incorporation in seedlings (measured by MS) was >95% as seen for representative peptides (Figure 2A). This level of label incorporation is sufficient for quantitation of peptides by MaxQuant and is comparable with typical labelling efficiencies in human cell cultures. The reasons for the high labelling efficiency obtained with whole seedlings, as compared to Arabidopsis cell cultures, may reflect 1) the frequent changes of culture medium, such that high levels of labelled amino acids are maintained and 2) that seeds were germinated in label-containing medium, such that from the start of germination, rapidly dividing and developing seedling tissue is constantly exposed to labelled amino acids (perhaps reducing the requirement for autotrophic amino acid production).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0072207.g002. Figure 2. . Efficient SILAC labelling of Arabidopsis seedlings and assessment of arginine-proline conversion.. Mass spectra of unlabelled (light) and labelled (heavy) peptides of L37-2 ribosomal protein showing efficient labelling (SILAC ratio=1.0023) (A). Mass spectra of light and heavy (heavy proline) peptides of an RNA helicase protein (B).. . . . . . Low Relative Levels of Arginine-proline Conversion. A potential problem with SILAC is the in vivo metabolic conversion of arginine to proline, which can affect accurate quantitation of peptides. The presence of heavy proline-containing peptides reduces the signal of heavy arginine labelled peptides, leading to an underestimate of the heavy/light peptide ratio [3]. In mammalian cells, arginine conversion can occur in 10-15% of the proline pool [26] and around 30-40% of proline-containing peptides can contain heavy proline [27]. To assess the degree of arginine-proline conversion we searched for peptides that contained heavy proline in 4 out of 5 of the biological replicates. We identified only 32 different heavy proline-containing peptides from the many thousands of sequenced peptides. For example, one such peptide (MVPMETQEVTDSLPKAQSK) was from an ATP-dependent RNA helicase-like protein (At2g28240). It was not labelled with heavy lysine and all occurrences contained heavy proline, but never with a high ratio (the averaged ratio over 5 biological reps was 0.14) (Figure 2B). Overall, arginine-proline conversion was approximately 6% (comparing the total number of heavy proline-containing peptides to the total number of proline-containing peptides) and peptides containing heavy proline were all present in relatively low ratios.. . . Identification of Up- and Down-regulated Proteins in Response Salt Treatment. To demonstrate the utility of SILAC labelling of whole seedlings to address dynamic changes in protein composition, we examined the response in shoots of seedlings exposed to modest salt stress [28]. Seedlings were grown in medium containing 80 mM NaCl for 7 days (from day 12 to 19 of culture/8-15 days post-germination) (Figure 1C). Label swap experiments for control and salt-treated seedlings were performed, giving a total of six biological repetitions. During the routine correlation analysis of all of the datasets (label swap experiments should give positive and negative correlations) one repeat did not give good correlation and thus five biological repeats were analysed. No phenotypic differences were observed between labelled and non-labelled untreated seedlings. Chlorosis of young leaves was previously observed in Arabidopsis plants watered with 50 or 150 mM NaCl [8] but we did not observe phenotypic differences between salt-treated (80 mM for 7 days) and untreated seedlings at the time of harvest, although some yellowing of leaves was seen at around 23 days of culture.. We identified a total of 2,858 proteins with a minimum of two peptides (14,347 unique peptides/22,991 peptides in total). Following quantification using MaxQuant [23], 92 and 123 proteins were consistently either up- or down-regulated by the saline treatment, respectively, in at least four of the five biological replicates (Figure 3; Tables S1-S3). The functions of the identified proteins were analysed using the DAVID Functional Enrichment Chart Tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/content.jsp?file=functional_annotation.html). Enrichment of gene ontology (GO):Biological Process terms showed over-representation of proteins involved in photosynthesis amongst up-regulated proteins (Figure 4A) whereas in the down-regulated protein set, terms associated with various stress responses and cell wall enzymes were over-represented (p<0.05) (Figure 4B). A similar analysis using the Plant Protein database (PPDB - http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu/) showed up-regulation of chloroplast and photosynthetic machinery, including RuBisCo, components of photosystems I and II and enzymes involved in tetrapyrrole synthesis for chlorophyll (Figure S1).

PMC4431829	Results. . At1g74800 (GALT5) encodes a putative galactosyltransferase. GALT5 and GALT2 proteins are members of the diverse GT-31 family in the CAZy database [41]. In plants, GT-31 includes three clades; one with proteins having only a catalytic GALT domain, another with proteins containing both a galactosyltransferase (GALT) domain and a GALECTIN domain, and the third with proteins having a domain of unknown function [42]. In Arabidopsis, 14 proteins have only the GALT domain, 6 proteins contain both domains, and 13 proteins have a domain of unknown function [18]. Four of these Arabidopsis GT-31 family members have been characterized. At1g26810 (GALT1) was identified as a beta-(1,3)-GALT involved in biosynthesis of a Lewis a epitope on N-linked glycans [43]. At1g77810 was reported to be a beta-(1,3)-GALT that catalyzes transfer of galactose (Gal) to an O-methylated Gal-beta-(1,3)-Gal disaccharide, which mimics a partial structure of AGP side chains [18]. At4g21060 (GALT2) was identified as a Hyp-GALT specific for AGPs [17]. Finally, At1g32390 (GALT31A) was shown to elongate beta-1,6-galactan side chains on AGPs [19]. Given that glycosyltransferases containing a lectin domain are involved in catalyzing the first step of O-glycosylation of animal glycoprotein mucins, it was hypothesized that plant GALTs containing analogous lectin domains may also function in initiating O-glycosylation of AGPs. Thus, we focused on functional characterization of such GALT genes containing a GALECTIN domain and here present our findings on GALT5. The GALT5 open reading frame is 2019 bp and corresponds to a protein of 672 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 77.3 kD. The predicted protein structures and alignment of GALT2 and GALT5 are depicted in S1 Fig Both proteins are predicted to be type II membrane proteins with N-terminal transmembrane domains. Thus, we hypothesized that GALT5 protein functions as an AGP-specific Hyp-GALT.. . . Heterologous expression of GALT5 in Pichia cells. Microsomal proteins from five independent recombinant Pichia lines expressing His tagged GALT5 were examined by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against the 6x His tag. All five GALT5 recombinant lines had the expected 77 kD protein band that reacted with the 6x His antibody (S2A Fig). A non-specific, smaller protein band (50 kD) was also detected in these recombinant lines. Transformed Pichia cells with the empty expression vector served as a negative control (NC) and lacked the recombinant 77 kD protein band, but contained the 50 kD protein band.. . . Heterologously expressed GALT5 demonstrates Hyp-GALT activity. An in vitro GALT assay developed by Liang et al. [29] was used to test for activity of the recombinant GALT5 expressed in Pichia cells. GALT assay components included detergent-permeablized microsomal membranes from the transformed Pichia cell lines expressing GALT5 protein as the enzyme source, UDP-[14C]Gal as the sugar donor and one of two AGP peptide analogs (d[AO]51 and [AO]7) as the substrate acceptor. The amount of GALT activity varied in the five recombinant cloned cell lines (C1 to C5) of Pichia based on the rate of [14C]Gal incorporation using the [AO]7 substrate acceptor, but all were significantly higher than Pichia cells transformed with the vector alone, which served as a negative control (NC) (S2B Fig).. . . Characterization of the GALT5 assay products by reverse-phase HPLC analysis. Pichia transformants expressing GALT5 were further analyzed for Hyp-GALT activity using two substrate acceptors: [AO]7, a synthetic AGP peptide and d[AO]51, a transgenically expressed and chemically deglycosylated AGP analog. Incorporation of [14C]Gal from UDP-[14C]Gal onto the two substrate acceptors was observed by HPLC fractionation (Fig 1C and 1F) and by comparison to the non-radioactive [AO]7 and d[AO]51 substrate acceptor peaks (Fig 1A and 1D). Two [14C]-radioactive peaks were detected, of which peak II has the same retention time as their respective substrate acceptors ([AO]7 and d[AO]51) (Fig 1C and 1F). The identity of peak I is not known; it may represent free [14C]Gal released by an endogenous galactosidase [29] or be composed of oligosaccharides with [14C]Gal incorporated into endogenous sugar acceptors as suggested previously [44]. Peak I was also present in previous studies with plant (Arabidopsis and tobacco BY2) microsomes [29]. Microsomal preparations from a Pichia cell line transformed with the empty expression vector were used as negative controls (NC) (Fig 1B and 1E). In summary, HPLC fractionation provided evidence for incorporation of the [14C]radiolabel from UDP-[14C]Gal onto the [AO]7 and d[AO]51 acceptors, and the [AO]7:GALT5 reaction product was subjected to further biochemical characterization.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.g001. Fig 1. . RP-HPLC fractionation of the [AO]7:GALT5 reaction products on a PRP-1 reverse-phase column.. Acceptor substrate alone (A and D), GALT reaction with microsomal membranes from the NC Pichia line transformed with the empty expression vector (B and E) and the GALT reaction with microsomal membranes from the transgenic Pichia C5 line (C and F) were fractionated by RP-HPLC using identical elution conditions. Radioactive Peak II coeluted with the [AO]7 and d[AO]51 acceptor substrates in the GALT5 reaction and was used for subsequent product analysis.. . . . . . Product characterization by acid and base hydrolysis indicates GALT5 transfers Gal to Hyp residues. To confirm that the [14C]radiolabel remained associated with Gal, RP-HPLC fractions containing the [14C]radiolabeled [AO]7:GALT5 reaction products were pooled and subjected to total acid hydrolysis. The resulting acid hydrolyzed [14C]radiolabeled monosaccharide was fractionated by HPAEC and showed that the [14C]label co-eluted with Gal, thereby confirming incorporation of [14C]Gal onto the [AO]7 peptide (S3 Fig).. In another set of experiments, base hydrolysis was used to confirm that the [14C]Gal residues were added to Hyp residues and to examine the extent of galactosylation of the [AO]7 peptide acceptor. Base hydrolysis degrades peptide bonds, but keeps Hyp-glycosidic bonds intact [45]. The intact [14C]radiolabeled [AO]7 peptide product eluted in the void volume (V0) on the P2 column, whereas the base hydrolysate of this product eluted at DP4 (Fig 2A). Given that Hyp residues alone elute as a DP3 sugar on a P2 column, it was concluded that GALT5 catalyzes the addition of one Gal onto the [AO]7 peptide, consistent with our previous work [17]. Further confirmation of this conclusion was provided by fractionation of the base hydrolysate on a CarboPac PA-20 column and observing that the [14C]radiolabel co-eluted with an authentic Hyp-Gal standard (Fig 2B and 2C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.g002. Fig 2. . Bio-gel P2 fractionation of the RP-HPLC purified [AO]7:GALT5 reaction product and High-Performance Anion-Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC) of the resulting base hydrolysis product.. (A) Bio-gel P2 fractionation of the RP-HPLC purified [AO]7:GALT5 reaction product before and after base hydroylysis. Permeablized microsomal membranes from the Pichia C5 line expressing 6x His-GALT5 served as the enzyme source in the [AO]7:GALT5 reaction. Elution profiles of the reaction product before and after base hydrolysis are shown. The column was calibrated with high-Mr dextran (V0), galactose (Vt), xylo-oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization (DP) 2 to 5 and xyloglucan-oligosaccharides (DP6-9); their elution positions are indicated with arrows at the top of the figure. The elution position of free Hyp amino acid (corresponding to DP3) is shown with an arrow in the panel. Base hydrolysis produces a radioactive peak eluting at DP4, which corresponds to Hyp-Gal. (B) HPAEC profile of a chemically synthesized Hyp-Gal standard detected as a PAD response. (C) The radioactive peak eluting at DP4 coelutes with the chemically synthesized Hyp-Gal standard following HPAEC. Both the Hyp-Gal standard and the radioactive peak eluting at DP4 were fractionated in 5 mM NaOH elution buffer on a CarboPac PA-20 column.. . . . . . GALT5 is specific for AGPs. Various substrates that might act as potential substrate acceptors for a GALT were tested to investigate GALT5 enzyme specificity. Namely, [AO]7, [AO]14, and d[AO]51, consisting of non-contiguous peptidyl Hyp residues, were used to examine AGP peptide sequences of various lengths. [AP]7, consisting of alternating Ala and Pro residues, was used to test the requirement of peptidyl Hyp for galactosylation. ExtP, a chemically synthesized extensin peptide consisting of contiguous peptidyl Hyp residues, was used to test whether contiguous peptidyl Hyp residues act as potential acceptors. Two pectic polysaccharides, RGI from potato and RG from soybean fiber, were also used as potential substrates acceptors. All the non-AGP substrate acceptors, including [AP]7, failed to incorporate [14C]Gal, indicating the GALT5 activity was specific for AGP sequences containing non-contiguous peptidyl Hyp. It was also observed that the incorporation of the [14C]radiolabel decreased with increasing lengths of the [AO] acceptor substrates (Fig 3).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.g003. Fig 3. . Effect of various peptide and polysaccharide acceptor substrates on incorporation of [14C]radiolabeled galactose.. Permeablized microsomal membranes from the NC Pichia line transformed with the empty expression vector and the C5 Pichia line expressing 6x His-GALT5 served as the enzyme source in the GALT reactions. [AO]7, [AO]14, and d[AO]51 contain 7, 14, and 51 [AO] units, respectively. A chemically synthesized extensin peptide (ExtP) contains repetitive SO4 units. [AP]7 contains 7 [AP] units. Rhamnogalactan I (RGI) from potato and RG from soybean represent pectin polymer substrates. Enzyme reactions using UDP-[14C]Gal as the sugar donor were done in triplicate and mean values SE are presented.. . . . . . Biochemical characteristics of the GALT5 enzyme. To determine the preference of nucleotide sugar donors, the standard GALT assay was performed with other potential sugar nucleotides including UDP-[14C]Glc, UDP-[14C]Xyl, and GDP-[14C]Fuc in the presence and absence of the [AO]7 peptide acceptor. Hyp-GALT activity was only detected with UDP-[14C]Gal as the sugar donor (S4A Fig). The effects of pH and divalent cations on the GALT assay catalyzed by GALT5 were also determined. The [AO]7:GALT5 activity had a pH optimum of 6.5 with a HEPES-KOH buffer, which is consistent with the lumen of Golgi vesicles where the enzyme is predicted to be localized (S4B Fig). Mg2+ followed by Mn2+ significantly enhanced GALT5 activity, whereas the presence of Ca2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Ni2+ had inhibitory effects to different extents (S4C Fig).. . . GALT5 is localized to the Golgi. To establish the subcellular localization of GALT5, live-cell confocal imaging of fluorescently tagged GALT5 protein was performed. A GALT5-YFP fusion was constructed and transiently co-expressed with a Golgi marker protein, sialyltransferase (ST)-GFP, or an ER marker, HDEL-GFP, in tobacco leaves. Upon co-infiltration with the Golgi marker, GALT5-YFP was observed to co-localize with the Golgi marker as discrete punctate structures typical of a Golgi-localized staining pattern (Fig 4). Whereas upon co-infiltration with the ER marker, GALT5-YFP was not observed in the characteristic reticulate structures typical of ER localization (Fig 4). GALT5 was also examined using multiple subcellular localization prediction programs (TargetP, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) and Golgi Predictor http://ccb.imb.uq.edu.au/golgi/) and the TMHMM server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) [46] for the prediction of transmembrane domains (TMD). Based on these analyses and consistent with the live cell imaging data, GALT5 is targeted to the secretory pathway and has a single N-terminal TMD (S1 Fig).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.g004. Fig 4. . Subcellular localization of GALT5 in tobacco leaf epidermal cells observed 5 days after infiltration.. Transiently expressed GALT5-YFP co-localized with sialyltransferase (ST)-GFP fusion protein (a Golgi marker) as well as with HDEL-GFP fusion protein (an ER marker). These constructs were examined by laser-scanning confocal microscopy under fluorescent and white light, and the fluorescent images were merged to observe co-localization. Bar = 10mum.. . . . . . Isolation of T-DNA insertion alleles for the GALT2 and GALT5 genes. To elucidate the in vivo functions of GALT2 and GALT5 in Arabidopsis, a reverse genetic approach was adopted. Two independent mutant alleles were isolated for each of the genes, galt2-1 and galt2-2 for GALT2 and galt5-1 and galt5-2 for GALT5. Homozygous lines were identified by PCR analysis and T-DNA insertion sites were confirmed by sequencing (Fig 5A). Testing for genetic redundancy was addressed by crossing galt2 and galt5 single mutants and using PCR to screen for galt2 galt5 double mutants in the resulting F2 generation. RT-PCR analysis showed that the GALT2 transcript was absent in both galt2 allelic mutants as well as in the double mutant and that the GALT5 transcript was absent in both galt5 allelic mutants as well as in the double mutant (Fig 5B and 5C). The qPCR analysis corroborated these findings and confirmed the identification of allelic knock-out galt2, galt5 single mutants as well as galt2 galt5 double mutants (Fig 5D and 5E).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.g005. Fig 5. . Molecular characterization of galt single and double mutants.. (A) GALT2 and GALT5 gene structure and T-DNA insertion sites in galt2-1, galt2-2, galt5-1 and galt5-2 mutants. The intron-exon structures of GALT2 and AGALT5 are indicated (introns are drawn as lines and exons as rectangles, with white rectangles representing coding sequences and black rectangles representing UTRs). Sites of T-DNA insertions in galt2 and galt5 are marked (triangles) as are the locations of primer sequences (arrows) used for PCR screening.

(C) RT-PCR analysis of transcripts from rosette leaves of 14-d-old wild type (Col-0), the homozygous galt2 and galt5 mutant lines used for producing the double mutant, and the galt2 galt5 double mutant. (D) and (E) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis to detect GALT2 and GALT5 transcript abundance in the galt mutants. Total RNA was isolated from rosette leaves of 14-d-old wild type, galt2-1, galt2-2, galt5-1, galt5-2, and galt2 galt5 plants. UBQ10 primers were used as controls. Data were normalized to the level of wild type GALT2 expression in panel D and wild type GALT5 expression in panel E, which was set to 1 arbitrary unit (a.u.) in each case. Means  SE of three biological replicates (n = 3) are shown.. . . . . . GALT2 and GALT5 have overlapping but distinct expression patterns. To analyze the spatial and developmental expression of GALT2 and GALT5, RNA was isolated from different organs and tissues and analyzed by qPCR (Fig 6A). Both GALT genes were ubiquitously expressed in Arabidopsis in an overlapping, but distinct pattern. GALT2 was highly expressed in root and stem, whereas GALT5 was highly expressed in stem, root and leaf. These findings are consistent with data from publicly available expression databases (S5 Fig). Transcriptomics analysis using GeneCAT (http://genecat.mpg.de) [47], Genevestigator (http://www.genevestigator.com/gv/) [48] and the Arabidopsis eFP browser (http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi) [49] indicate both genes are widely expressed with GALT5 having a higher overall expression compared to GALT2. It is also noteworthy that these databases indicate that GALT5 is highly expressed in mature pollen (S5A and S5C Fig).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.g006. Fig 6. . Organ-specific expression of GALT2 and GALT5 and gene compensation in galt2, galt5 and galt2 galt5 mutants observed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis.. (A) Organ-specific relative expression of GALT2 and GALT5 genes. qPCR was performed with total RNA samples from roots, stem, inflorescence, silique, seedling, cell culture, cauline leaves, and juvenile rosette leaves. The averages of three biological replicates are shown. The y axis shows x-fold expression with respect to the lowest encountered value of GALT2 expression in seedling equal to one arbitrary unit (a.u.). (B) Functional compensation of galt2 and galt2 galt5 as revealed by qPCR analysis. Data were normalized to the level of GALT2 expression in seedlings of wild type, which was set to 1 arbitrary unit (a.u.). RNA was isolated from 14-d-old seedlings. (C) Functional compensation of galt5 and galt2 galt5 as revealed by qPCR analysis. The expression values were normalized to the level of GALT5 expression in seedlings of wild type, which was set to 1 arbitrary unit (a.u.). UBQ10 was used as an internal control for all the qPCR experiments. The asterisks indicate significant differences in expression of transcripts of the six GALTs tested compared with wild type according to a Student's t test (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, ***, P<0.001).. . . . . . Compensatory mechanism of GALT2 and GALT5. To investigate whether transcriptional compensation occurs between GALT2 and GALT5 or with the other four members of the Arabidopsis GT-31 family encoding both GALT and GALECTIN domains, qPCR analysis was conducted using the galt2, galt5 and galt2 galt5 mutants (Fig 6B and 6C). While GALT2 and GALT5 transcripts were absent in their respective mutant lines, significant increases in the abundance of GALT4, GALT5, and GALT6 transcripts in the galt2 mutants and GALT2, GALT3, GALT4, and GALT6 transcripts in the galt5 mutants were observed. The compensation mechanism was also observed in the galt2 galt5 double mutants, with increases in the abundance of GALT6, GALT4, and GALT3 transcripts over that seen in the single mutants. These results indicate transcriptional compensation within this GT-31 clade with the notable exception of GALT1, whose expression is unchanged in the mutant backgrounds. Interestingly, GALT2 and GALT5 demonstrated the most pronounced increases in transcriptional compensation.. . . Biochemical phenotypes of the mutants: GALT activity, beta-Yariv-precipitable AGPs and immunolabeling with AGP specific monoclonal antibodies. To provide in vivo evidence that GALT5 encodes an AGP GALT and examine potential functional redundancy with GALT2, the two allelic galt5 mutants were analyzed along with the galt2 mutants and the galt2 galt5 double mutant with respect to GALT activity and content of beta-Yariv-precipitable AGPs (Table 1). GALT activity was reduced by 22% and 28% in the two galt5 mutants compared to wild type plants. This was similar to the 21% and 14% reductions for the galt2 mutants. Double mutants, however, demonstrated a 34% reduction in activity. In addition, the galt5 mutants had 40% and 43% less beta-Yariv precipitable AGPs compared to wild type, while the galt2 mutants had reductions of 32% and 35%. The double mutants, however, contained 56% less beta-Yariv precipitable AGPs. The profiles of these beta-Yariv precipitable AGPs were also examined by HPLC by extracting AGPs from equal amounts of plant material, and revealed that virtually all these AGPs, as opposed to a single or subset of these AGPs, were affected in the single and double mutants, with the double mutant being more severely affected (S6 Fig). It was observed that the AGP peaks in the mutants eluted later and had less protein than the wild type AGP peaks, corresponding to reduced glycosylation.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.t001.

Detergent-solubilized microsomal fractions were used for performing a standard GALT assay using [AO]7 as the peptide substrate acceptor and UDP-[14C]Gal as the sugar donor, and AGPs were extracted, precipitated by beta-Yariv reagent, and quantified from 14-d-old plants. The values are averages of at least two independent experiments from two biological replicates. Students t tests were performed to determine statistical significance (a P < 0.05, b P <0.01).. . . . In addition, immunofluorescence staining of AGP epitopes was performed to confirm that reduced levels of glycosylated AGPs were present in the galt2galt5 mutants compared to wild type. The galt2galt5 double mutant displayed reduced labeling intensity using four AGP specific monoclonal antibodies, JIM4, JIM8, JIM13 and MAC207, in root hairs, pollen tubes and seeds compared to the stronger signals displayed by the corresponding wild type samples (S7 Fig). It should be noted that Arabidopsis pollen tubes do not react with JIM13, as previously reported by Dardelle et al. [41].. . . Pleiotropic growth and development phenotypes of the mutants. While the galt2 and galt5 single mutants were largely indistinguishable from wild type, the double mutants displayed several altered phenotypes related to growth and development under normal growth conditions (Table 2, Figs 7-9, S8 and S9 Fig). Such alterations were reflected in the larger number of rosette leaves, increased flowering time, reduced silique length, and reduced plant height (Table 2, S8 Fig). Root hair length and density were reduced in some single mutants and in the double mutant (Fig 7). Specifically, galt2-1 and galt5-1 showed a reduction in root hair length, as did the double mutant, while root hair density was reduced in galt2-1, galt2-2, and galt5-1 along with the double mutant. Root growth was also inhibited in some single mutants (galt5-1 and galt5-2) and in the double mutant (Fig 9). In addition, pollen tube growth was slightly inhibited in the double mutant (Fig 8) and frequently associated with disruption of pollen tube tip growth (S9 Fig). Several conditional phenotypes were also examined and revealed marked differences in the mutants as described in the next section.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.t002. Table 2. .

Twenty flowers from each genotype and 25 pollen tubes from each flower were measured using Image J. The experiment was done in triplicate and the values were subjected to statistical analysis by ANOVA, followed by the Tukey's honestly significant difference test.

Mutants demonstrate reduced inhibition of pollen tube growth and root growth in the presence of beta-Yariv reagent. beta-Yariv reagent is known to inhibit pollen tube growth by disrupting AGPs [50-52]. Here, pollen from galt2 and galt5 single mutants as well as the double mutant were germinated and grown in beta-Yariv reagent (Fig 8). Wild type pollen was used as a control and showed reduced pollen tube growth in the presence of beta-Yariv reagent as expected. In contrast, pollen tube growth was less inhibited in the single mutants, and was even less inhibited in the double mutant. In other words, the mutants showed less sensitivity to beta-Yariv-induced pollen tube growth inhibition. alpha-Yariv reagent, which does not bind to AGPs but is similar in structure to beta-Yariv reagent, was used as another control treatment in these experiments and produced results identical to the unsupplemented control treatment. It should be noted that this experiment also revealed other non-conditional mutant phenotypes in the control treatment, namely pollen tube growth was slightly inhibited in the double mutant (Fig 8) and frequently associated with disruption of pollen tube tip growth (S8 Fig), as mentioned in the previous section.. beta-Yariv reagent is equally well known to inhibit root growth by disrupting AGPs [53-55]. Here, galt2 and galt5 single mutant seedlings as well as double mutant seedlings were grown in the presence of beta-Yariv reagent (Fig 9). Wild type seedlings were used as a control and showed reduced root growth in the presence of beta-Yariv reagent as expected. In contrast, the single mutants showed a beta-Yariv insensitive root growth phenotype, and the double mutant displayed even greater beta-Yariv insensitivity with respect to root growth. alpha-Yariv reagent was used as another control treatment in these experiments and produced results identical to the unsupplemented control treatment. This experiment also revealed another non-conditional mutant phenotype in the control treatments at 21 d, namely root growth was inhibited in some single mutants (galt5-1 and galt5-2) and in the double mutant (Fig 9), as mentioned in the previous section.. . . Mutant seed germination and root growth are hypersensitive to NaCl. Seed germination and root growth are known to be impaired in response to salt [37]. Here, the double mutants showed a significant reduction in seed germination compared to wild type, while the single mutants showed some reduction in seed germination, which was not statistically significant (S10 Fig). Radicle growth, however, was delayed in the single mutants and even more delayed in the double mutant in response to 100 and 150 mM NaCl (S11 Fig). Root growth was also inhibited in the single mutants, and even more inhibited in the double mutant over a 21 d time course, in response to 100 and 150 mM NaCl (Fig 10 and S12 Fig). This hypersensitive root growth was observed in the presence of varying concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl, but not in the presence of CsCl and mannitol (S13 Fig).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.g010. Fig 10. . Salt induced inhibition of primary root elongation in galt2, galt5 and galt2 galt5 mutants.. Five-day-old wild-type, galt2, galt5 and galt2 galt5 seedlings germinated on MS medium were transferred onto media containing (A) 100 mM NaCl or (B) 150 mM NaCl and grown vertically. Root elongation (i.e., increase in length after transfer) was measured after 7, 14 and 21 d of growth. Data are the means  SE of measurements from five independent experiments (total n = 100). Statistical differences were determined by one way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey's honestly significant difference test (*, P <0.05 and **, P <0.01).. . . . Single and double mutants were also subjected to a root-bending assay, which is routinely used to screen salt-hypersensitive mutants or transgenic plants [37]. WT plants readily reoriented root growth, whereas the single mutants showed delayed root bending with the double mutants showing a greater delay (Fig 11). Other known salt-hypersensitive mutants, including sos5, which encodes a fasciclin-like AGP called FLA4, and fei1 and fei2, which encode cell wall receptor like kinases which interact with sos5, were also tested in this root bending assay as they may be related to galt2 and galt5 and showed various degrees of delayed root bending [24], [56] (Fig 11D). The angle of root curvature in the single mutants and to a larger extent in the double mutants were observed to be greater than that of the WT due to their delayed response towards salt stress (Fig 11E).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.g011.

Vertical bars represent mean  SE of the experimental means from at least two independent experiments (n = 5), where experimental means were obtained from 15 seedlings per experiment.. . . . Root tip swelling in response to 100 mM NaCl was observed in the galt single mutants; this swelling was even more pronounced in the double mutant (Fig 12). Other mutants, including sos5, fei1, fei2, fei1fei2, and fei1fei2sos5, were also examined and demonstrated root tip swelling in response to salt as reported previously [56].. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125624.g012.

PMC3421987	Results. . . hps4 exhibits enhanced production of root surface-associated APase, reduced anthocyanin accumulation, and increased inhibition of primary root growth under Pi-deficient conditions. APase production is a universal response of plants to Pi starvation (Tran et al., 2010). To identify novel molecular components involved in plant responses to Pi starvation, APase was used as a biomarker in a large-scale screen for Arabidopsis mutants with altered sensitivity to Pi starvation. M2 seeds from EMS-mutagenized M1 plants were directly sown on half-strength MS P+ or P- medium. Nine days after germination (DAG), APase production was examined. APase activity on the root surface can be detected by application of the APase substrate BCIP; cleavage of BCIP by APases produces a blue precipitate (Lloyd et al., 2001). Using this method, an Arabidopsis mutant, hps4 (hypersensitive to Pi starvation 4), was identified with enhanced APase activity on its root surface under P- conditions as indicated by a dark-blue staining compared with the WT (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1A at JXB online). On P+ medium, hps4 also displayed a light-blue staining, whereas no blue staining was evident on the WT (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Under both P+ and P- conditions, total APase activity in shoots and roots did not differ between hps4 and the WT as analysed by both quantitative measurement and in-gel assays (Supplementary Fig. S1B, C); however, the secreted, root surface-associated APase activity was much higher for hps4 than for the WT (Fig. 1C).. . Fig. 1.. . Growth characteristics, APase activities, and anthocyanin contents of the WT and the hps4 mutant. (A) Morphology of 9-day-old seedlings of the WT and hps4 grown on Pi-sufficient (P+) and Pi-deficient (P-) medium. (B) Detection of APase activity by BCIP staining on the root surfaces of WT and hps4 seedlings shown in A. (C) Root-associated APase activity in 9-day-old seedlings of the WT and hps4 grown on P+ and P- medium. (D) Anthocyanin contents in 12-day-old seedlings of the WT and hps4. For C and D, values represent the mean and SE of three replicates. Means with asterisks are significantly different from the WT (P < 0.05, two-sample t-test).. . . . Accumulation of anthocyanin is another hallmark response of plants to Pi starvation and is thought to protect chloroplast membranes. Thus, the levels of anthocyanin were compared in the hps4 mutant and the WT. On P+ medium, anthocyanin levels were low and did not differ between hps4 and WT plants. Under P- conditions, anthocyanin accumulation was dramatically increased in both the hps4 mutant and the WT, but the level was 30% lower in hps4 than in the WT (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online).. . hps4 was also more sensitive to PSI inhibition of primary root growth. At 9 DAG, the hps4 primary root was 15% shorter than that of the WT on P+ but 70% shorter on P- medium (Fig. 1A). In addition, hps4 formed lateral roots earlier than the WT under P- conditions (Fig. 1A).. . . Expression of PSI genes is enhanced in hps4. . To examine whether PSI gene expression was affected in hps4, the expression of eight PSI genes in hps4 and the WT was analysed. The PSI genes examined included two high-affinity Pi transporters, Pht1;1 and Pht1;4 (Muchhal et al., 1996); two non-coding transcripts, At4 and IPS1 (Burleigh and Harrison, 1999; Martn et al., 2000); an RNase, RNS1 (Bariola et al., 1994); an miR399D (Fujii et al., 2005); and two APases, ACP5 (del Pozo et al., 1999) and AtPAP10 (Wang et al., 2011). At 4 DAG, the induction of all eight PSI genes was significantly higher in hps4 than in the WT under Pi starvation, while induction did not differ when plants were grown on P+ medium (Fig. 2). At 9 DAG, the expression of six PSI genes was still higher in hps4 than in the WT, but the expression of the two non-coding transcripts was similar in hps4 and the WT (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online).. . Fig. 2.. . Analysis of PSI gene expression in the WT and the hps4 mutant. Four-day-old seedlings of the WT and hps4 grown on P+ or P- medium were used for real-time PCR analysis. The names of the genes examined are indicated on the top of each panel. Values are the means and SD of three biological replicates and represent fold changes normalized to transcript levels of the WT on P+ medium. Means with asterisks are significantly different from the WT (P < 0.05, two-sample t-test).. . . . The contents of total P and cellular Pi were then analysed in 9-day-old WT and hps4 seedlings. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online, total P and cellular Pi contents did not differ significantly between hps4 and WT shoot and root tissues under either P+ or P- conditions.. . . Genetic and molecular analysis of hps4. . When hps4 was backcrossed to the WT, all F1 plants showed WT phenotypes, and F2 progeny derived from selfed F1 plants segregated into mutant and WT phenotypes in a ratio of 1:3 (55:165). These results indicated that the hps4 mutant phenotypes were caused by a single recessive mutation. A map-based cloning approach was then used to identify the molecular lesion in hps4. hps4 (Columbia ecotype) was crossed to a plant with Landsberg erecta background to establish a mapping population. Using F2 progeny derived from this cross, the HPS4 gene was mapped to a 91 kb region on chromosome 1 (Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online). After sequencing all the annotated genes in this region, a point mutation was found within the SABRE gene (At1g58250) (Fig. 3A). This mutation caused a transition of nucleotide G to C, which converted an alanine to a proline at position of 2118 on the SABRE protein. To confirm that mutated SABRE was linked to the mutant phenotypes, regions encompassing the mutated site in 10 WT and 10 mutant F2 progeny derived from the cross between hps4 and the WT (Columbia ecotype) were sequenced. All 10 of the mutant progeny were homozygous for the mutation, and the 10 progeny with the WT phenotype either had no mutation or were heterozygous for the mutation, indicating that the homozygote mutation in the SABRE gene was linked to the hps4 mutant phenotypes; this was consistent with the genetic analysis, which had indicated that hps4 is caused by a single recessive mutation. The phenotypes of a previously characterized sabre mutant (sab1-1) (Aeschbacher et al., 1995) and six additional SALK T-DNA insertion lines of the SABRE gene were then further examined. The T-DNA insertions in sab1-1 and the six SALK lines disrupted expression of the SABRE gene. On the P+ medium, similar to hps4, sab1-1 and the six SALK lines showed light-blue BCIP staining, while on the P- medium, the roots of the sab1-1 and six SALK lines had darker blue BCIP staining (Fig. 3B, C). This provided additional evidence that hps4 is a new allele of the SABRE gene. The length of primary roots of sab1-1 and the six SALK lines on both P+ and P- media were, however, much shorter than those of hps4. The stronger root phenotypes of sab1-1 and the six SALK lines were probably due to the complete disruption of transcription of the SABRE gene because of T-DNA insertion. In contrast, the transcription level of the SABRE gene in hps4 was not affected by the point mutation, suggesting that hps4 is only a weak mutant allele (see the results later in the text).. .

SABRE was previously identified as a gene that is required for normal cell expansion in Arabidopsis (Aeschbacher et al., 1995). Alhough analysis of its protein sequence indicated that its C-terminal part (residues 1900-2450, Fig. 4A) shares homology with the sequences presented in a group of plant Golgi-localized proteins (Procissi et al., 2003; Xu and Dooner, 2006), the exact biochemical function of the SABRE protein is still unknown. For the maize homologue of SABRE, APT1, this sequence is required for protein localization to Golgi bodies (Xu and Dooner, 2006).. . Fig. 4.. . Expression patterns of the HPS4 gene. (A) Relative expression of the HPS4 gene in different plant organs determined by q-PCR. (B) Tissue-specific expression patterns of the HPS4::GUS gene. Top row, from left to right: a 9-day-old seedling, a cotyledon, part of the root elongation zone, and root apex. Middle row, from left to right: a 20-day-old mature plant, stem, and a junction between leaf blade and leaf petiole. Bottom row, from left to right: a fully opened flower, petal, sepal, gynoecium, stamen, and silique.. . . . A previous study showed that the expression of the SABRE gene was so low that it could not be detected by northern blot, even when poly(A) RNA was used (Aeschbacher et al., 1995). In this work, quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) was used to analyse SABRE expression in different plant organs. The results showed that HPS4/SABRE was expressed in all plant organs but that the expression was lower in roots and stem than in leaves, flowers, and siliques, and that expression was highest in leaves (Fig. 4A). In the hps4 mutant, the expression level of HPS4 was similar to that of the WT (data not shown), indicating that the point mutation in HPS4 did not affect its RNA stability. To determine further the tissue-specific expression patterns of HPS4, a 2 kb DNA sequence was fused upstream of its transcription start site with a GUS reporter gene and this gene construct was transformed into WT plants. Twenty-five independent HPS4::GUS transgenic plants were generated, and the GUS expression pattern of one representative line is shown in Fig. 4B. In a 9-day-old HPS4::GUS seedling, GUS expression was observed in all types of cells in the root apex and was restricted to vascular tissue in the upper part of the root. GUS expression was strong in the hypocotyl and the entire cotyledon. In a mature plant, GUS expression was evident in all leaves, with stronger expression in young leaves than in old leaves. GUS expression in the stem was relatively weak, and no GUS expression was detected in leaf petioles. In addition, GUS expression was evident in all flower organs, including the sepal, petal, stamen, and gynoecium. In the silique, GUS expression was high at both ends but weak in the middle. The expression pattern of GUS (Fig. 4B) was consistent with the q-PCR analysis (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, it was found that the expression of the HPS4 gene was not affected by Pi starvation (data not shown).. . . HPS4 antagonistically interacts with ethylene signalling in regulating plant responses to Pi starvation. Previous studies indicated that SABRE interacts with ethylene signalling to regulate cell expansion (Aeschbacher et al., 1995). Therefore, in order to determine whether HPS4/SABRE was also involved in regulating plant responses to Pi starvation by interacting with ethylene signalling, WT and hps4 seeds were directly sown on P+ medium. At 5 DAG, the germinated seedlings were transferred to P+ or P- medium with or without addition of the ethylene action inhibitor Ag+. Addition of Ag+ to P+ medium had no effect on primary root growth of either the WT or hps4 but it suppressed the APase activity on the root surface of hps4 (Fig. 5A-C). On P- medium, however, addition of Ag+ partially suppressed the PSI inhibition of primary root growth and APase activity of the WT (Fig. 5A-C), and the hypersensitivity of hps4 in PSI inhibition of primary root growth and production of APase was reduced (Fig. 5A-C). The length of the primary root of hps4 was restored to 85% of that of the WT; that is, the difference in root length became similar to that on P+ medium. When Ag+ was added to P- medium, the APase activity on the root surface of the WT and hps4 also became similar, and APase activities for both were even lower than that of the WT without the addition of Ag+. This result was consistent with a previous finding that ethylene is a positive regulator of PSI production of APase (Lei et al., 2011).. . Fig. 5.. . Effects of the ethylene perception inhibitor Ag+ on root growth, APase activity, and anthocyanin accumulation of WT and hps4 seedlings.

(B) Close-up view of APase activities detected by BCIP staining on the root surfaces of the seedlings shown in A. (C) Primary root length of 9-day-old seedlings of the WT and hps4 grown on P+ and P- medium with or without addition of 10 muM Ag+. (D) Anthocyanin accumulation in 9-day-old seedlings of the WT and hps4 grown on P- medium with or without addition of 10 muM Ag+. For C and D, values represent the mean and SE of three replicates. Means with asterisks are significantly different from the WT (P < 0.05, two-sample t-test).. . . . In a previous work, it was found that enhanced ethylene signalling suppresses anthocyanin accumulation in Pi-starved plants (Lei et al., 2011). Therefore, the effect of Ag+ on anthocyanin accumulation in hps4 was examined. On P- medium, addition of Ag+ increased anthocyanin accumulation in both hps4 and the WT, and levels of anthocyanin became similar in WT and hps4 plants (Fig. 5D). This indicated that the low accumulation of anthocyanin in Pi-starved hps4 seedlings was caused by enhanced ethylene signalling.. The effect of the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor AVG on primary root growth and root-associated APase activity was then tested. The seeds of the WT and hps4 were directly sown on P+ medium. At 5 DAG, the seedlings were transferred to P+ and P- medium with or without addition of 0.2 muM AVG. After another 7 d, the primary root growth and root-associated APase activity were examined. The results showed that AVG treatment did not suppress these two mutant phenotypes in hps4 (Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online). This indicated that the mutant phenotypes in hps4 were not due to enhanced ethylene biosynthesis.. . . Root tips of Pi-starved hps4 accumulate more auxin than do those of the WT. Several previous studies have shown that ethylene inhibits root growth by up-regulating auxin biosynthesis and interfering with its transport process (Stepanova et al., 2005, 2007; Rzicka et al., 2007; Swarup et al., 2007; Negi et al., 2008). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether the hps4 mutant accumulates more auxin in its root tissues than the WT under P- conditions. To test this hypothesis, the free IAA contents of apical 5 mm root sections of 9-day-old hps4 and WT seedlings grown on P- medium were directly measured. As shown in Fig. 6A, the IAA content was about twice as great in the hps4 mutant than in the WT. Accordingly, the expression of the auxin-responsive genes GH3.4, IAA2, and IAA14 was significantly higher in hps4 than in the WT under Pi starvation (Fig. 6B). The expression of 10 auxin biosynthetic genes (Zhao, 2010) was further compared between the WT and hps4. Expression of all these genes, except YUC5, was significantly higher in hps4 than in the WT (Fig. 6C). These results indicated that transcriptional control was involved in the enhanced auxin production in the hps4 mutant.. . Fig. 6.. .

PMC2295253	Results. . Transgenic ABA deficient lines with constitutive expression of ABI4 are glucose insensitive. Screens for sugar insensitive mutants revealed the importance of ABA and ABA signal transduction, in particular ABI4 (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Huijser etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000; Rook etal. 2001). To study the interaction between ABA biosynthesis and ABI4 in sugar signalling we generated transgenic lines with constitutive ABI4 expression driven by a CaMV 35S promoter in an ABA deficient (aba2-1) background. ABI4 expression in these transgenic aba2-1 plants is independent from plant sugar status. Two lines homozygous for the 35S::ABI4 construct were selected, i.e. lines L6 and L10. Both lines germinated normally but showed a stunted growth phenotype (Fig.1a) similar to what has been reported previously for severe ABI4 overexpression lines (Sderman etal. 2000). Expression analysis on control media showed that ABI4 expression is high in L6 and L10 and exceeded glucose-induced ABI4 expression in developmentally arrested WT Col seedlings by approximately 5-8 fold (Fig.1b).. Fig.1Analysis of transgenic ABA deficient lines with constitutive ABI4 expression. Plant phenotypes of WT Col, aba2-1, and two transgenic lines with constitutive ABI4 expression in aba2-1 (L6 and L10) after 2,5weeks of growth on soil (a). ABI4 expression was detected by qRT-PCR in Col, aba2-1, L6 and L10 seedlings grown for two weeks on control or 8% glucose media. Values are averages of two experiments SD (b). Seedling phenotypes after two weeks of growth on control, 8% sorbitol (sorb), 8% glucose (glc) or 8% glucose+0,1muM ABA (glc+ABA). Similar results were obtained in three experiments (c). ApL3 expression was detected by qRT-PCR in Col, aba2-1, L6 and L10 seedlings grown for four days on control half-strength MS (con) or half-strength MS+100mM sucrose (suc) media. Values are averages of three experiments SD (d). The gin phenotype of Col, aba2-1, L6 and L10 was tested by growing the lines for two weeks on control, 8% sorbitol and 8% glucose media. All lines showed greening on control (con) and sorbitol (sorb, osmotic control) media as expected (Fig.1c). On glucose the Col seedlings showed an arrested phenotype whereas aba2-1 showed a gin phenotype as reported before (Fig.1c, Len and Sheen 2003). Also ABI4 expression levels in glucose-arrested Col seedlings were enhanced whereas in aba2-1 ABI4 expression was very low. The L6 and L10 aba2-1/35S::ABI4 lines have very high ABI4 levels but, importantly, display a gin phenotype (Fig.1c). The gin phenotype of aba2-1 and the transgenic lines could be reverted to WT by the addition of 100nM ABA as was reported before for aba mutants (Fig.1c, Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000). Thus, in an ABA deficient background ABI4 overexpression does not restore wild type sensitivity to glucose.. Sucrose feeding induces ApL3 gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings. This sugar regulation of the ApL3 promoter has been used as basis for a screen for sugar response mutants. Rook etal. (2001) reported on isi sugar response mutants that were unable to fully activate ApL3 expression in response to sucrose. The identification of aba2/isi4 and abi4/isi3 as mutants with an impaired sucrose induction phenotype revealed a role for ABA biosynthesis and signalling in control of ApL3 expression (Rook etal. 2001). To study the sugar-induced ApL3 expression in WT Col, aba2-1, L6 and L10 stratified seeds were sown on 100mM sucrose media. After four days plant material was harvested and ApL3 expression levels determined. Sucrose feeding resulted in an approximate six fold induction of ApL3 in Col seedlings (Fig.1d). The induction of ApL3 is 25% lower in the aba2-1 seedlings, which is in agreement with the isi phenotype of aba2/isi4 (Rook etal. 2001). In the L6 and L10 aba2-1/35S::ABI4 lines the ApL3 expression level on sugar-free control media already exceeds that of sugar-treated WT seedlings. Sugar feeding of L6 and L10 seedlings further boosted ApL3 expression 7-9 fold higher than sugar-treated WT seedlings (Fig.1d).. . . Glucose and ABA trigger a similar developmental early seedling arrest. High sugar concentrations arrest early seedling development in Arabidopsis. After germination vegetative seedling growth is blocked, characterized by the absence of cotyledon greening and leaf formation. Equimolar concentrations of an osmotic control did not block development in this early seedling stage (Fig.2a; Zhou etal. 1998; Laby etal. 2000; Rognoni etal. 2007). Previously, Lopez-Molina etal. (2001) showed that treatment with ABA arrested this post-germination switch from embryonic to vegetative growth as well. ABA-arrested seedlings showed neither greening nor leaf formation similar to glucose-arrested seedlings (Fig.2a). In comparison to ABA-arrested seedlings, glucose-arrested seedlings were larger due to the longer hypocotyl and larger cotyledons (Fig.2b). Moreover, significant root growth was observed in glucose-arrested seedlings, which is absent in ABA-arrested seedlings (Fig.2a, b). Further, in glucose-arrested seedlings often a pink colouration was observed, indicative for anthocyanin accumulation that was absent in ABA-arrested seedlings (Fig.2a, b).. Fig.2Glucose and ABA signalling arrest early seedling development and induce a drought tolerant phenotype. Ler-0 seedling phenotypes are shown after growth for twelve days on control (con, half-strength MS+1% sucrose), or on con medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol (sorb), 7% glucose (glc) or 10muM ABA (ABA) (a). A close-up image of a glc-arrested seedling (left) and an ABA-arrested seedling (right) is shown (b). Developmentally arrested seedlings have a drought tolerant phenotype. Seeds were grown on control (con) or on con media containing either 10muM ABA (ABA) or 7% glucose (glc) for nine days. At day nine the seedlings were subjected to a drought treatment as indicated (c). Hereafter seedlings were allowed to recover on control media for five days after which survival was scored. The survival percentage following drought treatment is presented (c). ABA-arrested seedlings possess an enhanced resistance to drought stress compared to non-arrested seedlings (Lopez-Molina etal. 2001). A comparison was made between the drought resistance phenotype of glucose- and ABA-arrested seedlings. Control (non-arrested) seedlings did not survive a drought treatment of 2.5h (Fig.2c). ABA-treated seedlings showed a near 100% survival rate after 6h of drought, the longest treatment tested in our experiments. Glucose-arrested seedlings showed an intermediate drought resistance. After 2.5h of drought stress, glucose-treated seedlings showed a nearly 90% survival rate and after 6h of drought the survival rate was 50% compared to 0% survival observed for control seedlings. Thus, a clear drought resistant phenotype was observed for glucose-arrested seedlings.. The ABA-induced early seedling developmental arrest depends on functional ABI3 and ABI5 genes. abi3 and abi5 mutants did not block early seedling development in response to ABA. Moreover, WT seedlings exposed to ABA showed strongly enhanced ABI3 and ABI5 protein levels (Lopez-Molina etal. 2001, 2002). Both genes encode transcriptional regulators important for seed development and LEA gene expression (Koornneef and Karssen 1994; Parcy etal. 1994, Finkelstein and Lynch 2000; Carles etal. 2002). Lopez-Molina etal. (2002) showed that during the early seedling developmental arrest several LEA genes were re-induced as well. This re-induction of seed transcriptional regulators and LEA gene expression suggested that a late embryogenesis program is re-initiated by ABA treatment, inducing a drought tolerant phenotype in such arrested seedlings (Lopez-Molina etal. 2002). It was investigated whether the same transcriptional regulators and LEA genes were expressed by glucose signalling during early seedling development. A role for ABI5 has been proposed in GIN signalling and ABI5 expression is sugar responsive (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000; Brocard etal. 2002; Arroyo etal. 2003). ABI5 expression thus is a good positive control in this experiment. Gene expression upon glucose feeding was studied by germinating seeds on control medium until the batch reached 70% germination (time point zero, t=0). At this time point a sample was collected for RNA isolation while the rest of the seeds were transferred to control, sorbitol, glucose or ABA containing media for an additional 24h. After 24h samples were collected for gene expression analysis. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), the expression of ABI3, ABI5, AtEM1, AtEM6 and RAB18 was studied in response to the different treatments. Gene expression was studied in three independent experiments. In each experiment the gene expression level at t=0 was set to one (Table2). Some variation in gene expression levels between the three experiments was observed, likely due to the fact that for each experiment independently generated seed batches were used. Generally, continued growth on control media after t=0 resulted in a decreased expression of all five genes (Table2). In contrast, treatments with sorbitol, glucose and ABA enhanced the expression of all genes studied, except for the sorbitol treatment in the second experiment. In this particular experiment gene expression decreased on sorbitol, however, this decrease was less pronounced compared to the control treatment. ABA treatment resulted in the re-induction of ABI3, ABI5 and the LEA genes, which is in line with results reported by Lopez-Molina etal. (2002). Also glucose exposure significantly induced the expression levels of all five genes although the expression levels are in general somewhat lower than in response to ABA. Thus ABI3 is upregulated by glucose as well, which indicated a possible role for ABI3 in glucose responsiveness. The observation that the expression levels of the genes studied are in general lower after sorbitol treatment compared to glucose treatment indicates that the glucose-induced expression is not an osmotic response..

The gene expression levels were measured at t=0 and after a 24h treatment on control media (con, half-strength MS+1% sucrose) and on con media supplemented with either 8% sorbitol (sorb), 8% glucose (glc) or 10muM ABA (ABA) media. The expression level at t=0 was set to 1. The experiment was performed three times and the results for each experiment are indicated. Expression studies using seedlings grown for five days on control, sorbitol (7%) or glucose (7%) media confirmed the induction of these genes (Fig.3). In five days old glucose-arrested seedlings enhanced expression levels were detected for ABI3 and ABI5 as well as the LEA genes AtEM1, AtEM6 and RAB18. The induction of these genes by sorbitol was roughly five fold lower (Fig.3). After 72h of growth on ABA-free media, seedlings lose the capacity to re-induce ABI3, ABI5 and LEA expression and to arrest early seedling development in response to ABA (Lopez-Molina etal. 2001, 2002). To study whether the induction by glucose is restricted to a similar time frame seeds were germinated and grown for three days on half-strength MS and subsequently switched for two additional days to elevated sorbitol and glucose media. The re-induction by glucose of ABI3, ABI5, EM1, EM6 and RAB18 was largely lost (Fig.3, glc 72h). The weaker induction by sorbitol is essentially lost after three days (Fig.3, sorb 72h). Thus, the glucose-response that induced ABI3, ABI5 and LEA expression is confined to a similar time frame as observed for ABA. This is in agreement with the finding that glucose regulation of ABI4 and ABI5 expression was dependent on developmental stage (Arroyo etal. 2003) and that sugar arrests early seedling development only in a small 2-3day time frame after sowing (Gibson etal. 2001).. Fig.3The glucose-regulated expression of ABI3, ABI5 and LEA genes is restricted to a limited time frame after the start of germination. The expression of EM1, EM6, RAB18, ABI3 and ABI5 genes was quantified by qRT-PCR after germination and growth for five days on different media. Ler-0 seeds were plated for five days on control media (con, half-strength MS+1% sucrose), or on con medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol (sorb) or 7% glucose (glc). The values are an average of three experiments and in each experiment the expression on glc was set to one. It was investigated whether this gene expression regulation is limited to a small time window after the start of germination as has been shown for ABA regulation (Lopez-Molina etal. 2002). Therefore seeds were germinated on con media for three days and thereafter switched to either sorb (sorb 72h) or glc media (glc 72h). In conclusion, the glucose-induced block of early seedling development mimics the ABA-induced arrest of vegetative development in young seedlings. Both glucose- and ABA-arrested seedlings have a drought resistant phenotype and show enhanced expression levels of seed expressed genes. The observation that ABI4 overexpression is unable to restore WT glucose sensitivity in the aba2-1 mutant shows that WT ABA biosynthesis is essential for the GIN response. Apparently, next to ABI4 additional factors which are under control of ABA are important for GIN signalling. Two candidates are ABI3 and ABI5. Both play a role in the ABA-induced early seedling developmental arrest and gene expression and protein stability of both transcription factors is affected by ABA (Lopez-Molina etal. 2001; Lopez-Molina etal. 2002; Lopez-Molina etal. 2003; Zhang etal. 2005; this study). A role for ABI5 in glucose signalling has been established; abi5-1 has a gin phenotype (although somewhat weaker compared to abi4) and ABI5 expression is regulated by sugar (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000; Brocard etal. 2002; Arroyo etal. 2003; this study see . Table 2). However, a role for ABI3 is controversial (for review Finkelstein and Gibson 2001; Leon and Sheen 2003; Gibson 2004; Rognoni etal. 2007). Since ABI3 is important for the ABA-induced developmental arrest and is induced by glucose, our hypothesis is that ABI3 is involved in GIN signalling as well. Therefore, the gin phenotype and glucose-regulated gene expression were studied in abi3 mutants.. . . abi3 mutants are glucose insensitive. The glucose insensitive phenotype of WT Ler-0 and the abi3 mutant was investigated by plating seeds of both genotypes on media with elevated glucose concentrations (6-8% glucose). Initially, two abi3 mutant alleles were tested, i.e. the weak abi3-1 allele (producing normal, drought tolerant seeds) and the strong abi3-5 allele (producing green, drought intolerant seeds, Ooms etal. 1993). As expected WT Ler-0 early seedling development was arrested in response to high glucose concentrations. In contrast, approximately 60-100% (differed between experiments) of both abi3-1 and abi3-5 seedlings showed greening on high glucose media, suggesting that abi3 is a gin mutant, (Fig.4a). All genotypes showed greening on control and osmotic control media (Fig.4a, control and 7% sorbitol, respectively). The gin phenotype was observed for abi3 mutants in several experiments using independently grown and harvested seed batches (data not shown). Next, the strength of the gin phenotype of abi3-1 was assessed in comparison to that of the ABA deficient mutant aba1-1, which is in the Ler-0 background as well. The aba1-1 mutant, like other ABA deficient mutants tested, was shown to possess a gin phenotype (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Huijser etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000). A similar percentage of seedling greening was observed for aba1-1 and abi3-1 when grown on glucose media (Fig.4b) suggesting that both mutants possess a comparable gin phenotype.. Fig.4abi3 mutants have a gin phenotype. Representative Ler-0, abi3-1 and abi3-5 seedlings are shown that were grown for 12days on control media (half-strength MS+1% sucrose), or on control medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol or 7% glucose (a). The gin phenotype of abi3-1 was compared to that of the ABA deficient mutant aba1-1. Seedlings were grown for 12days on the indicated media before seed germination and seedling greening were scored (b). Six additional mutant alleles (abi3-8, abi3-9, abi3-10, abi3-11, abi3-12, and abi3-13) were obtained (a kind gift of Dr. E. Nambara) and tested for their gin phenotype. These abi3 mutants were tested along with two known gin mutants, abi4-3 and abi5-7 in the gin assay. All these mutants were retrieved from a screen for mutants insensitive to the unnatural (-)-ABA (Nambara etal. 2002). The ABA insensitivity of the mutants was tested by plating the mutants on half-strength MS media containing 1% sucrose+10muM ABA. The ABA insensitivity observed was in agreement with that reported by Nambara etal. (2002) (see Table3). The abi3-8, abi3-9, abi3-10, abi4-3 and abi5-7 mutants had a strong ABA insensitivity, the abi3-12 and abi3-13 showed a weaker phenotype. We did observe 40% greening for abi3-13 on ABA media while originally no abi phenotype was observed for this allele (Nambara etal. 2002). These mutants were isolated on (-)-ABA and the (-)-ABA insensitivity does not necessarily parallel (+)-ABA insensitivity (Nambara etal. 2002). Next, these mutants were plated on control, sorbitol- and glucose-containing media, respectively. On 7% glucose media strong gin phenotypes were observed for abi4/gin6 and abi5 mutants as shown by the high percentages of greening, in agreement with earlier reports (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Huijser etal. 2000; Laby etal. 2000). Again a strong gin phenotype was observed for abi3, in agreement with our observation using abi3-1 and abi3-5 mutants. Five out of the six additional abi3 mutants tested show a gin phenotype. For four abi3 mutants the gin phenotype was comparable to that of abi4-3 and abi5-7 (Table3). The strong ABA insensitive abi3 mutants are strong gin mutants as well whereas the mutants with a weaker phenotype (abi3-11 and abi3-12) show a weaker phenotype on glucose media. However, exceptionally abi3-13 shows a weak abi phenotype but a strong gin phenotype. The abi3-11 mutant lacks an ABI insensitive phenotype and did not show a gin phenotype either. In conclusion, gin phenotype analysis of eight abi3 alleles confirms the glucose insensitive phenotype for abi3. Moreover, the gin phenotype of abi3 is comparable to that of other known gin mutants like aba1, abi4 and abi5..

Values are the percentage of cotyledon greening scored after 11days. The experiment was repeated once with similar resultsaThe ABA insensitivity scored for the different mutant alleles based on cotyledon greening by Nambara etal. (2002). . . Glucose-induced expression of ABI4, ABI5 and RAB18 is reduced in abi3. Glucose-induced early seedling developmental arrest is associated with expression of ABI3, ABI4, ABI5 and a subset of LEA genes (Arenas-Huertero etal. 2000; Cheng etal. 2002; Arroyo etal. 2003; this study). The involvement of ABI3 in glucose-regulated gene expression was tested for three genes ABI4, ABI5 and RAB18 as a representative of the LEA genes. For expression analysis the weak abi3-1 and the strong abi3-5 mutants were used. Seedlings of all three genotypes were grown for 24h on control media or on control media containing 8% glucose.. Both RAB18 and ABI5 expression were sensitive to glucose addition. In WT seedlings, glucose treatment induced these two genes on average 14times in comparison to t=0 (Fig.5a, c). However, on glucose the expression levels of both genes were much reduced in abi3-1 and abi3-5 compared to WT (Fig.5a, c). Glucose treatment did not result in a clear induction of ABI4, especially when compared to ABI5 and RAB18. Instead ABI4 expression was roughly maintained to the same level observed for t=0 but was enhanced when compared to the control treatment which displayed a strong reduction of ABI4 expression (Fig.5b). ABI4 transcripts were 2-8 fold lower in the abi3 mutant backgrounds upon glucose treatment. Thus, the abi3 mutation did not allow full glucose-induced expression of RAB18, ABI4 and ABI5. Interestingly, the reduced expression is most pronounced in the strong abi3-5 mutant background.. Fig.5Altered glucose-regulated gene expression in abi3 mutants. Glucose-regulated gene expression was studied in WT Ler-0 and abi3-1 and abi3-5 mutants. Gene expression was quantified by qRT-PCR at t=0, the time of glucose application and after 24h on control medium (con, half-strength MS+1% sucrose) or con medium supplemented with 8 % glucose. At the t=0 time point approximately 70% of the seeds had germinated. The values indicate an average of three independent experiments (two experiments for abi3-5). The WT Ler-0 expression on 8% glucose was set to one in each experiment. The glucose-regulated expression in Ler-0 and the two abi3 mutants was studied for RAB18 (a), ABI4 (b) and ABI5 (c). The gene expression ratio of Ler-0 over abi3 was calculated because all three genes were already under expressed in abi3-1 and abi3-5 at t=0. This ratio was calculated by dividing the average gene expression in Ler-0 by the expression in abi3 (for both mutants) at t=0 and after 8% glucose treatment for all three genes (d). Already at t=0 reduced expression levels for all three genes were observed in the abi3 mutant backgrounds. This was expected since the ABI transcription factors were found to affect each others expression in seeds (Sderman etal. 2000). Moreover, ABI3 is an important regulator of LEA gene expression (Parcy etal. 1994; Kermode 2005). To rule out that this reduced expression is responsible for the phenotype observed after glucose treatment the gene expression ratios of WT over mutant were determined for t=0 and after glucose feeding. For each gene the expression level of WT is divided by the expression level of each mutant. These values show the fold difference of expression between WT and both abi3 mutants (Fig.5d). E.g. the level of RAB18 expression is 9 fold higher in WT compared to abi3-1 at t=0. After glucose treatment the fold difference for RAB18 expression was 38. Except for the ABI4 expression ratio of Ler-0 over abi3-1, all WT/mutant expression ratios showed increased values after glucose exposure. This confirms that both mutants have a reduced ability to control glucose-regulated gene expression.. . . Other sugar insensitive phenotypes of abi3. The sugar response phenotype of the abi3-1 mutant was investigated in the sis, sun and glucose-induced delay of germination assays. High sucrose concentrations block early seedling development similar to high glucose concentrations. High sucrose resistant mutants are known as sis mutants (Laby etal. 2000). Several mutants affected in the same genes were retrieved from gin and sis screens, e.g. gin1/sis4/aba2, gin6/sis5/abi4 and gin4/sis1/ctr1. The sis phenotype of WT Ler-0, abi3-1 and abi3-5 was analysed by plating these genotypes on 13% sucrose media. Both abi3 mutants show a sucrose insensitive phenotype (Fig.6a, b) and can thus be considered as sis as well as gin mutants.. Fig.6The abi3-1 mutant shows additional sugar signalling defects. The sugar response phenotype of abi3-1 was assessed in three additional assays. The sugar insensitive (sis) phenotype was assessed by scoring the early seedling developmental phenotype (by seedling greening) after growth on elevated sucrose concentration. Representative Ler-0, abi3-1 and abi3-5 seedling phenotypes are shown after growth on 13% sucrose media for 13days (a). The percentage of germination and seedling greening of Ler-0, abi3-1 and abi3-5 was determined after growth for 13days on control (half-strength MS+1% sucrose) or on control medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol or 13% sucrose media (b). The sucrose uncoupled (sun) phenotype was assessed by measuring plastocyanin (PC) expression levels by qRT-PCR in two days old seedlings grown on sucrose containing media in darkness. Sucrose repressed the PC transcript level in dark-grown two days old WT seedlings in comparison to WT seedlings grown on sugar-free media, however in sun mutants PC repression by sucrose is much less pronounced (Dijkwel etal. 1997). Indicated are the relative PC expression on sucrose containing media for WT PC-LUC and sun6/abi4 (assayed on 2% sucrose) and Ler-0 and abi3-1 (assayed on 1% sucrose). Values indicate an average of at least three experiments. PC expression of two days old seedlings grown on sugar-free half-strength MS was set to 1 for each genotype in every experiment (c). Germination is delayed by glucose addition. abi3-1 was tested for glucose-induced delay of germination by plating seeds on half-strength MS (0.5MS), 0.5MS+7% sorbitol (7% sorb) and 0.5MS+7% glucose (7% glc). Sugars were already present during stratification (solid lines). In addition, seeds were stratified on sugar-free 0.5MS media and directly after stratification transferred to 0.5MS+7% sorbitol (MS>7% sorb) and 0.5MS+7% glucose (MS>7% glc, dashed lines). Seed germination after the different treatments was scored daily for eight days for Ler-0 (d) and abi3-1 (e). Dijkwel etal. (1997) previously reported on sugar insensitive mutants that have been isolated using the sun screen. Dark-grown seedlings transiently express photosynthesis genes, including plastocyanin (PC, Dijkwel etal. 1996). This transient increase of photosynthesis gene expression is repressed on sucrose media. In sun mutants sucrose did not repress this transient PC gene expression in dark grown seedlings (Dijkwel etal. 1997). sun6 is such a mutant which was shown to be allelic to abi4 (Huijser etal. 2000). A possible sun phenotype of abi3-1 was investigated by quantifying PC mRNA levels in two days old, dark-grown seedlings using qRT-PCR. Elevated PC expression was observed in sucrose-treated seedlings of sun6/abi4-3 compared to its WT PC-LUC parent confirming its sun phenotype (Fig.6c). Interestingly, the abi3-1 mutant showed enhanced PC expression as well and, therefore, abi3 has a sun phenotype (Fig.6c). abi4 mutants displayed a nine fold increased PC expression level in sugar-treated seedlings compared to WT. In the abi3 mutants the PC expression level is only two fold increased, indicating that abi3 is a weak sun mutant.. Sugars delay seed germination in Arabidopsis. ABA plays a role in this glucose-induced delay of germination (Ullah etal. 2002; Price etal. 2003; Dekkers etal. 2004; Chen etal. 2006). Despite the involvement of ABA, several abi mutants (abi1-1, abi2-1, abi4 and abi5) are normally sensitive to glucose during germination (Price etal. 2003; Dekkers etal. 2004). Sugar insensitive mutants like gin6/abi4 and gin2/hxk1 that are insensitive to the glucose-induced early seedling developmental arrest are sensitive to glucose during germination (defined as radicle emergence). This indicates that the glucose response during germination (which delays radicle protrusion) and early seedling growth (which arrests seedling development) are two distinct processes (Price etal. 2003; Dekkers etal. 2004). The, abi3-1 and abi3-5 alleles were plated on 2.5% glucose. The presence of 2.5% glucose clearly delayed germination of WT seeds. The osmotic control of 2.5% sorbitol only slightly affected germination compared to control media. Both abi3 mutants showed a clear resistance against glucose as displayed by their reduced germination delay (data not shown), which is in agreement with observations of Yuan and Wysocka-Diller (2006) who reported on the glucose insensitivity of abi3-1 during germination.. In our experiments seeds were sterilized, plated on sugar media, and after a three day stratification period moved to the growth chamber and germination was scored the following days. Interestingly, when WT seeds were stratified on sugar-free media (half-strength MS) and after stratification transferred to sugar-containing plates, the delay of germination by 2.5% glucose was completely lost (data not shown). Thus, stratification on sugar-free media suppressed the inhibitory effect of glucose on germination. This effect of stratification was further investigated using higher (7%) glucose and sorbitol concentrations. Ler-0 and abi3-1 seeds were plated either on control, sorbitol or glucose media, stratified for three days and moved to the growth chamber. Alternatively, seeds were stratified on sugar-free control media and shifted to media containing sorbitol or glucose, and then placed in the growth chamber. Continuous treatment with 7% glucose severely delayed germination of WT seeds but affected abi3-1 significantly less as expected (Fig.6d, e). Also in this experiment, stratification on sugar-free media strongly suppressed the germination response to glucose in WT Ler-0. Even germination of the abi3-1 mutant, which already showed a reduced sensitivity to glucose during germination could be improved by stratification on sugar-free media. The germination speed of the abi3-1 mutant after stratification on sugar-free media was similar to the osmotic control indicating that this combination completely suppressed the germination delay by glucose. The glucose response during germination was affected by stratification but not the osmotic response (sorbitol treatment). This was observed for WT Ler-0 as well as the abi3-1 mutant thereby differentiating glucose from osmotic signalling.. . . abi2-1 and era1-2 mutant are glucose response mutants. Our results on the physiological and molecular level indicate that glucose-arrested seedlings mimic ABA-arrested seedlings. The finding that ABI3 is important for glucose signalling in addition to ABI4 and ABI5 led us to test the glucose insensitive phenotype of two other ABA signalling mutants, i.e. abi2-1 and era1. Brady etal. (2003) proposed a genetic pathway for ERA1 and the ABI1-ABI5 genes in seed ABA responsiveness based on double mutant analysis between the era1 mutant and the abi mutants. This analysis suggested that ABI1 and ABI2 act at or upstream of ERA1, while ERA1 acts at or upstream of ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5 (Brady etal. 2003). ABI2 encodes a phosphatase 2C protein that acts as a negative regulator of ABA signalling and the abi2-1 mutation results in an ABA insensitive phenotype (Koornneef etal. 1984; Leung etal. 1997). WT Ler-0 and abi2-1 seeds were plated along with abi3-1 on control, 7% sorbitol and 7% glucose media. In addition to abi3, the abi2-1 mutant displayed a gin phenotype as well, although its phenotype is not as strong as that of abi3-1 (Fig.7a). On control and sorbitol media all seedlings showed greening.. Fig.7Other ABA signalling mutants have sugar signalling defects as well. Putative glucose signalling defects were determined for the ABA insensitive mutant abi2-1 and the ABA oversensitive mutant era1-2. Ler-0, abi2-1 and abi3-1 were grown on control media (half-strength MS+1% sucrose), or on control medium supplemented with either 7% sorbitol or 7% glucose. After 12days germination and seedling greening percentage were scored (a). To investigate whether era1-2 has a glucose oversensitive phenotype both WT Col and mutant were grown on a sugar concentration which did not arrest early development of WT Col. Therefore, seedling greening of Col and the era1-2 mutant was scored daily on half-strength MS (0.5MS) and on 0.5MS+6% glucose. The seedling phenotype was scored for 11days (b). The ERA1 gene encodes a beta subunit of a protein farnesyl transferase (Cutler etal. 1996) and acts as a negative regulator of ABA signalling. The era1-2 mutant has an ABA hypersensitive phenotype. If ERA1 exerts a similar function in glucose signalling, a glucose oversensitive (glo) phenotype is expected for the era1-2 mutant. Seeds of WT Col and era1-2 were plated on half-strength MS+6% glucose media. This glucose concentration allowed seedling greening of the WT Col seedlings. Greening started for WT seedlings from day four onwards. However, this glucose concentration arrested early seedling development of era1-2 seedlings. Even after eleven days no greening was observed for era1-2 seedlings (Fig.7b), which indicates that era1-2 indeed has a glo phenotype. The era1-2 mutant has a more dormant phenotype compared to WT (Cutler etal. 1996). Therefore, seed germination was synchronized as much as possible by using after-ripened seeds and employing a three day stratification period on sugar-free media. On control media (half-strength MS) germination was somewhat delayed but that did not affect cotyledon greening. On 6% glucose era1-2 germination reached similar germination levels as WT seeds despite that germination was 1-2 days delayed (data not shown). This slower germination of era1-2 does not explain the much larger difference observed for cotyledon greening on glucose media. Thus, the small difference in germination timing between era1-2 and WT is not responsible for the seedling greening phenotype..
PMC4642543	Results. . Subnuclear localisation of WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY60. The subnuclear localisation of three WRKY transcription factors with a known role in ABA signal transduction, WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY60, was analysed 15hours after transformation of A. thaliana wildtype (Col-0) protoplasts. WRKY60 localised exclusively to the nucleoplasm. WRKY18 and WRKY40 localised to the nucleoplasm or to nuclear bodies (Fig. 1A-C). Size and number of nuclear bodies was different for each WRKY transcription factor, with larger nuclear bodies present for WRKY18. Identical localisation to nuclear bodies was also identified after transient expression of WRKY18 and WRKY40 in Arabidopsis seedlings (Fig. 1D). DAPI staining confirmed the nuclear body localisation of WRKY18 and WRKY40 within the nuclei (Fig. 1D). No co-localisation of nuclear bodies with chromatin could be detected. After transient expression in N. benthamiana, nuclear bodies could be seen from the onset of protein expression and did not result from elevated protein accumulation (Figure S1). Likewise, Propidium iodide (PI) cell death staining of Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that no cell death occurred in nuclei where WRKYs were localised to nuclear bodies (Figure S2). For a quantitative analysis, the percentage of nuclei with WRKYs localised to nuclear bodies was calculated after transient protoplast transformation. WRKY18 and WRKY40 localised to nuclear bodies in 51% or 44% of nuclei, respectively (Fig. 1E,F).. . . Increased nucleoplasmic localisation of WRKY40 in response to ABA. To test the effect of ABA on WRKY localisation, transformed A. thaliana protoplasts (Col-0) were incubated with 10muM ABA for 10-30min and subnuclear localisation was quantified (Fig. 1E,F). For WRKY18 the percentage of nuclei with nuclear body localisation did not significantly change. For WRKY40, however, the percentage of nuclei with nuclear body localisation decreased from 44% to 26%.. To investigate the involvement of the ABA core signalling pathway in ABA-dependent localisation of WRKY40, localisation experiments were performed with protoplasts of the Arabidopsis SNRK2.6 kinase mutant ost1-4 and of the snrk2.2/2.3/ost1-4 triple mutant. No changes in localisation were observed for WRKY40 in response to ABA in ost1-4 and snrk2.2/2.3/ost1-4 mutant protoplasts (Fig. 1G,H), indicating requirement for the ABA core signalling pathway.. A more nucleoplasmic localisation of WRKY40, comparable to ABA-treated protoplasts, was also observed when A. thaliana (Col-0) protoplasts were treated with the general Ser/Thr-kinase inhibitor Staurosporine (Fig. 2A). Localisation to nuclear bodies was reduced from 44% to 25%. This indicates that the subnuclear localisation of WRKY40 to nuclear bodies contains a phosphorylation-dependent component. Combined ABA and Staurosporine treatment did not further enhance nucleoplasmic localisation.. In order to determine the specificity of ABA in WRKY localisation, elevated NaCl treatment was tested as another abiotic stress stimulus. No localisation changes in response to NaCl were observed in A. thaliana (Col-0) protoplasts (Fig. 2B). Since WRKY40 and the closely related transcription factors WRKY18 and WRKY60 were previously shown to be involved in immune signalling, flg22, a pathogen elicitor, and MeJA, as a phytohormone analogue of biotic signalling were tested323334353637. In response to MeJA and flg22 treatment, no significant changes in WRKY40 localisation were detectable, indicating that increased WRKY40 nucleoplasmic localisation is stimulus-specific.. Taken together, these data indicate that WRKY40 has an increased nucleoplasmic localisation specifically in response to ABA. WRKY40 localisation depends on phosphorylation and a functional ABA core signalling pathway.. . . ABA dependent WRKY40 relocalisation is highly dynamic. To test whether the localisation changes in response to ABA are a result of a dynamic relocalisation of WRKY40 or the outcome of degradation in the nuclear bodies and new protein synthesis, A. thaliana protoplasts were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. MG132 itself had no effect on WRKY40 localisation and in combination with ABA did not affect the increased nucleoplasmic localisation (Fig. 2C).. In order to further analyse the localisation dynamics of WRKY40, protoplasts were treated with ABA for 15minutes and then ABA was removed by a buffer exchange. The percentage of nuclei with nuclear body localisation decreased after 15min ABA treatment and recovered after washing and 15min incubation in control buffer (Fig. 2D).. In conclusion, the ABA dependent increase in nucleoplasmic localisation of WRKY40 is the result of a highly dynamic process where WRKY40 protein shuttles between nuclear bodies and nucleoplasm.. . . WRKY18 and WRKY40 localise to Phytochrome B-containing nuclear bodies (PNBs). In order to investigate the identity of the nuclear bodies, co-localisation experiments were performed. WRKY18 and WRKY40 localised to identical nuclear bodies in Arabidopsis wildtype protoplasts (Fig. 3A). Further co-localisation experiments with marker proteins, including splicing factors and phytochromes, identified PHYB, PIF3 and PIF4 as proteins co-localising to the same nuclear bodies. WRKY18 nuclear body localisation did strongly overlap with PIF3, PIF4 and PHYB localisation in A. thaliana protoplasts (Fig. 3B,C). WRKY40 nuclear body localisation, however, did only overlap with a subset of PIF3-, PIF4- and PHYB-containing nuclear bodies (Fig. 3B,C).. To test for physical interactions between PIF3, PIF4, PHYB and WRKY proteins, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments were performed in N. benthamiana. Known interactions between PIF3, PIF4 and PHYB5253 served as control. WRKY18 and WRKY40 did not interact with PIF or PHYB proteins (Fig. 4A). Co-localisation and combined co-localisation and BiFC experiments with YC-PIF3/YC-PIF4, YN-PHYB and CFP-WRKY18/CFP-WRKY40 however confirmed co-localisation to the same nuclear bodies (Fig. 4B,C and Figure S3)..
PMC3346215	Results. . Strongly reduced total flavonol content in leaves of the ugt78d1 ugt78d2 double mutant. Three major flavonol glycosides, kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside (f1), kaempferol 3-O-glucoside-7-O-rhamnoside (f2), and kaempferol-3-O-[rhamnosyl (12 glucoside)]-7-O-rhamnoside (f3), were present in leaves of A. thaliana accession Columbia grown under non-stressed conditions (Bloor and Abrahams, 2002) (Fig. 2A). In ugt78d1 single mutant leaves, f1 was not detectable, whereas f2 and f3 accumulated to higher levels (Jones et al., 2003). However, in ugt78d2 single mutant leaves, f2 and f3 were strongly decreased, while f1 was increased (Tohge et al., 2005) (Fig. 2A). To quantify the total flavonol content in these ugt mutants, methanolic leaf extracts were hydrolysed and the released flavonol aglycones were analysed by HPLC. Although the flavonol glycoside pattern was altered in the ugt78d1 and ugt78d2 single mutants, both mutants maintained wild-type, total flavonol content (Fig. 2C). These observations suggest that UGT78D1 and UGT78D2 compete for flavonol aglycones as substrates, and the loss of flavonol 3-O-glycosylation in either single mutant is fully compensated by the remaining active flavonol 3-O-UGTs. However, the flavonol glycoside profile in leaves of the ugt78d1 ugt78d2 double mutant plants was severely altered; f2 and f3 were strongly reduced and f1 was not detectable. Furthermore, neither other forms of flavonol derivatives nor any flavonol aglycones were detected (Fig. 2A; data not shown). LC-MS analysis could also not reveal any flavonol aglycones (see Supplementary Table S1 available at JXB online). However, in contrast to the ugt single mutants, the total flavonol content was reduced; the ugt78d1 ugt78d2 double mutant contained less than one-third of the wild-type flavonol level. Kaempferol and quercetin contents were decreased to a greater extent, with only 21% and 18% of the wild-type content, respectively (Fig. 2B, C). However, isorhamnetin, a low abundant flavonol in wild-type plants, accumulated 3.5-fold in the ugt78d1 ugt78d2 double mutant (Fig. 2B, C). LC-MS analyses detected the strongly increased level of a compound corresponding to the molecular mass of an isorhamnetin-glucoside-rhamnoside, which may at least partly account for the increased isorhamnetin level in ugt78d1 ugt78d2 (see Supplementary Table S1). Enhanced isorhamnetin glucosides had also been described for the ugt78d2 single mutant, indicating the existence of an unknown 3-O-glucosyltransferase (Yonekura-Sakakibara et al., 2008).. .

(C) Total flavonol aglycone quantification after acid hydrolysis of the methanolic extracts from leaves and roots. Means SD determined from three independent experiments are shown.. . . . In summary, the loss of the major flavonol 3-O-glycosylation resulted in a strong reduction of total flavonol content. On the other hand, enhanced 3-O-glycosylation in UGT78D1 or UGT78D2 overexpression lines did not raise total flavonol levels (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online).. . . The expression pattern of UGT78D1 and UGT78D2 matches organ-specific reduction in flavonols. The reduction of total flavonol content was organ specific and different in inflorescences, stems, and leaves from that in roots. Similar to leaves, the total flavonol content was strongly reduced in both inflorescences and stems of ugt78d1 ugt78d2 plants as compared with the wild-type counterpart (data not shown). In roots, however, the total flavonol content of the double mutant was maintained at higher levels similar to the ugt78d2 single mutant (Fig. 2C).. The expression pattern of both UGT78D1 and UGT78D2 positively correlated with the organ-dependent reduction in total flavonol content in the ugt double mutant. Two-week-old transgenic lines expressing the GUS reporter gene under the control of either the UGT78D1 or UGT78D2 promoter indicated that both genes were well expressed at the basal part of the young leaves (Fig. 3A, B). The expression of UGT78D2 was also observed along the central vein of the leaves as well as in the cotyledons (Fig. 3B). In 3-week-old plants, the expression of both UGT78D1 and UGT78D2 was lower compared with that of 2-week-old plants and predominantly at the basal part of leaf petioles (Fig. 3C, D). The expression of both UGT78D1 and UGT78D2 was very low in roots (data not shown; Jones et al., 2003). These findings were further corroborated by publicly available microarray data using the Arabidopsis eFP Browser (Schmid et al., 2005; Winter et al., 2007) (Fig. 3E).. . Fig. 3.. .

Flavonoid biosynthetic genes are transcriptionally down-regulated in ugt78d1 ugt78d2. To examine whether the reduced flavonol content in leaves was accompanied by reduced transcript levels of the flavonoid biosynthetic genes, their mRNA abundance was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR in both ugt78d1 ugt78d2 double mutant and wild-type plants. In ugt78d1 ugt78d2, the transcripts of CHS, F3'H, FLS1, and DFR were significantly lowered to 50% in comparison with the wild-type counterpart (Fig. 4). However, the transcripts of CHI and F3H were not clearly different from wild-type levels. Furthermore, genes in the general phenylpropanoid pathway upstream of the flavonoid branch including PAL1, PAL2, PAL3, PAL4, 4CL1, 4CL2, 4CL3, and C4H were analysed. PAL1 and 4CL3 transcripts were significantly reduced to almost half in the double mutant compared with the wild type, whereas the reduction of C4H was less pronounced and 4CL1 mRNA levels were not altered. PAL2 showed only a tendency for repression, but it was more variable and also expressed to a lower extent than PAL1 in the wild type (Fig. 4). Eventually, the transcription of PAL3, PAL4, and 4CL2 in leaves was too low to allow an unambiguous evaluation in both the wild type and the mutant (Materials and methods). Thus, the committed steps of the phenylpropanoid pathway (PAL1) and of flavonoid biosynthesis (CHS) along with several intermediate steps were suppressed at the transcriptional level in ugt78d1 ugt78d2 to about one-half of wild-type expression. Neither PAL1 (and PAL2) nor CHS transcript levels were affected in either one of the single ugt mutants (see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online).. . Fig. 4.. . Transcription of genes involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses were used to assess transcript levels of the indicated genes in the ugt78d1 ugt78d2 double mutant relative to Col-0 (Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). Data were obtained from three independent experiments. Expression levels were normalized using S16 and TUB9 transcripts. Fold changes with 95% CIs are displayed. Asterisks indicate significance of the comparison with wild-type plants, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. The lower mean value of PAL2 indicated a tendency for repression of this gene which is expressed only to a low extent (P=0.0658).. . . . . . Transcriptional control of biosynthetic genes. Several families of transcription factors, in particular R2R3-MYB, bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix), and WD40 proteins, as well as bZIP, WRKY, and MADS-box proteins interact and establish transcriptional networks to control the general phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic genes (Borevitz et al., 2000; Zimmermann et al., 2004; Ramsay and Glover, 2005; Tohge et al., 2005; Quattrocchio et al., 2006; Stracke et al., 2007, 2010; Dubos et al., 2008; Hichri et al., 2011). Among them, Arabidopsis MYB11, MYB12, MYB111, or MYBL2 are flavonol-specific activators or repressors which are able to regulate flavonol biosynthesis independently from other cofactors (Czemmel et al., 2009). Since many of these transcription factors are controlled at the transcriptional level, several genes were analysed for deregulation in the ugt double mutant. However, neither MYB111, MYB12, MYBL2, PAP1/MYB75, PAP2/MYB90, nor HY5 (bZIP) transcript levels were significantly changed in parallel with the observed repression of the flavonoid biosynthetic genes (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). PAP2 was even induced, thus seemingly counteracting the suppression of the flavonoid branch.. Recently, miRNA156 was shown to affect the anthocyanin/flavonol ratio by targeting SPL9, a regulator of flavonoid-related transcriptional complexes (Gou et al., 2011). RNA interference could be also involved in the repression of flavonol biosynthesis by directly affecting the related genes. However, none of the repressed biosynthetic genes was listed as a confirmed or predicted target of known microRNAs (miRNAs) in A. thaliana (mpss.udel.edu/at/target.php). Furthermore, a blast search for known A. thaliana miRNAs derived from miRBase (www.mirbase.org) did not reveal any significant, high scoring hits. An independent search for homologous regions (20-mers allowing up to three mismatches) only identified imperfect overlaps within at most four genes (Y. Wang and G. Haberer, personal communication). Thus, a coordinated regulation of the repression based on direct RNA interference targeting the biosynthetic genes is unlikely.. . . Reduced PAL enzyme activity in ugt78d1 ugt78d2. The decreased transcript levels of PAL1 in ugt78d1 ugt78d2 prompted examination of whether PAL activity was also reduced. PAL activity was assayed in total protein extracts from ugt78d1, ugt78d2, ugt78d1 ugt78d2, and wild-type leaves. Both ugt78d1 and ugt78d2 single mutants retained wild-type levels of PAL activity, whereas the ugt78d1 ugt78d2 double mutant showed a significant reduction to 60% (Fig. 5). However, the endogenous levels of the PAL substrate phenylalanine were not changed in the double mutant compared with the wild type (Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online).. . Fig. 5.. . Quantification of PAL activity of ugt78d1, ugt78d2, ugt78d1 ugt78d2, tt4 ugt78d1 ugt78d2, ugt89c1 ugt73c6, fls1, and wild-type (Col-0, N-0) plants.

The mean values SD of three independent biological samples (pools of 4-6 plants) are displayed. Col-0-based (dark) and N-0-derived (white bars) lines are indicated. *P < 0.05 (based on multiple comparisons of different mutants with the corresponding wild type using Dunnetts t-tests). The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.. . . . . . The influence of reduced PAL activity on non-flavonol branches of phenylpropanoid metabolism. In addition to the flavonol pathway, the repression of PAL activity in ugt78d1 ugt78d2 might also affect other phenylpropanoid-dependent branches; that is, the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, sinapate esters, and lignin. In another scenario affecting a single branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway, suppression of lignin biosynthesis has led to metabolic overflow and enhanced flavonoid production (Besseau et al., 2007).. ugt78d1 accumulated essentially wild-type levels of total anthocyanins, while anthocyanin accumulation was already strongly suppressed in the ugt78d2 single mutant without any inhibitory effect on PAL expression (Figs 5, 6A) (Tohge et al., 2005). Since ugt78d1 ugt78d2 had low amounts of anthocyanin comparable with ugt78d2 (Fig. 6A), the repression of PAL did not further affect this downstream branch. However, DFR transcription was down-regulated in ugt78d1 ugt78d2 (Fig. 4).. . Fig. 6.. . Phenylpropanoid compounds of ugt78d1 ugt78d2 and Col-0 plants.

The mean values SD of six independent biological samples (pools of 4-6 plants) are displayed. **P < 0.01; paired t-tests. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. (C) Phloroglucinol-HCl-stained rosette leaves (left, bar=3mm) from 3-week-old plants and hand cross-sections of inflorescence stems (directly below the third internode) (right, bar=100mum) from 5-week-old plants.. . . . Sinapate esters, particularly sinapoyl malate, are abundantly present in Arabidopsis leaves. The double mutant, in contrast to the single mutants, had a slightly, yet significantly, reduced sinapoyl malate content compared with the wild type (Fig. 6B). Sinapoyl glucose was also slightly reduced in the ugt double mutant (data not shown).. To test whether the lignin biosynthetic branch was affected, two key genes involved in lignin biosynthesis were analysed by quantitative RT-PCR. The single HCT (hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase) and the isoform CCR1 (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase Class I) are important in initiating the biosynthesis of monolignol precursors (and of other cinnamic acid derivatives) (HCT) and catalysing the first step of the monolignol-specific pathway (CCR1) in A. thaliana (Jones et al., 2001; Lavergeat et al., 2001;. Raes et al., 2003; Besseau et al., 2007). Both HCT and CCR1 transcripts were not significantly affected in ugt78d1 ugt78d2 leaves (Fig. 4). In addition, changes in upstream steps contributing to lignin biosynthesis such as 4CL1, 4CL2, PAL3, and PAL4 (Raes et al., 2003) did not indicate transcriptional up-regulation (see above; Fig. 4). Thus, the biosynthesis of lignin precursors was essentially not altered at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, total lignin was examined histochemically using phloroglucinol-HCl staining of leaves and stems. The total flavonol content in inflorescence stems of ugt78d1 ugt78d2 was also reduced to a similar extent to that in leaves (data not shown). However, lignin deposits in both leaves and stems of ugt78d1 ugt78d2 were similar to wild-type levels (Fig. 6C). Finally, metabolites associated with the lignin biosynthesis pathway were assessed by LC-MS analysis. No immediate monolignol precursor was detected in the leaf extracts. Nevertheless, LC-MS analysis showed that the ugt78d1 ugt78d2 double mutant accumulated wild-type levels of the monolignol precursor-related derivatives p-coumaroyl-glucoside, p-coumaroyl-glucose-ester, and caffeoyl-glucose-ester (Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). Thus, these results indicated that lignin biosynthesis was not significantly affected in the ugt double mutant.. In summary, these analyses demonstrated that there were at most marginal effects on non-flavonol-specific branches of phenylpropanoid biosyntheses in ugt78d1 ugt78d2; notably, there were no compensatory up-regulations.. . . The reduction of PAL expression of ugt78d1 ugt78d2 is dependent on flavonol aglycone formation. To examine whether flavonoids themselves could play a role in the flavonol-specific reduction in PAL expression, the tt4 ugt78d1 ugt78d2 triple mutant was employed. The triple mutant tt4 ugt78d1 ugt78d2 was blocked at the committed step into flavonoid biosynthesis in the ugt double mutant background (Fig. 1). In contrast to the ugt78d1 ugt78d2 line, tt4 ugt78d1 ugt78d2 as well as the parent tt4 mutant had wild-type PAL activity (Fig. 5; data not shown) and the transcripts of both PAL1 and PAL2 even showed a tendency towards being up-regulated in the triple mutant (Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online). Thus, the suppression of PAL expression in ugt78d1 ugt78d2 was released either by the loss of flavonoids or by the loss of CHS activity. To distinguish these two possibilities, a chemical complementation approach was employed. The feeding of naringenin-an intermediate downstream of CHS/TT4, but upstream of FLS-to tt4 ugt78d1 ugt78d2 could re-implement the inhibition of PAL expression. Naringenin feeding led to the repression of PAL activity and to the transcriptional down-regulation of PAL1 similar to the extent observed for the glycosyltransferase double mutant (Fig. 7). The transcription of PAL2 which was expressed to a much lower extent was not significantly affected under this condition (Fig. 7B). Flavonols had been formed after administration of naringenin, confirming the uptake and processing of the compound by tt4 ugt78d1 ugt78d2 (Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online). Thus, the repression of PAL in the 3-O-glycosylation-compromised ugt78d1 ugt78d2 double mutant was flavonoid-dependent and related to naringenin or downstream naringenin-dependent steps. To narrow down the key regulatory step further, additional mutants defective in reactions either directly upstream or downstream of 3-O-glycosylation were examined for effects on PAL expression.. . Fig. 7.. . Chemical complementation of tt4 ugt78d1 ugt78d2 with naringenin. (A) PAL activity of tt4 ugt78d1 ugt78d2 with and without feeding of naringenin.

(B) Expression of PAL1 and PAL2 genes in the tt4 ugt78d1 ugt78d2 triple mutant after naringenin feeding relative to the non-fed triple mutant by quantitative RT-PCR analysis.

Data obtained from six biological sample samples (pools of 4-5 seedlings) are shown. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results.. . . . The fls1 mutant severely blocks flavonol biosynthesis at its final step (i.e. the formation of the aglycone moiety) and is almost devoid of flavonols (Fig. 1) (Stracke et al., 2009). However, PAL activity was not reduced, and transcription of PAL1 and PAL2 was even enhanced in the fls1 background (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online).. Flavonol 3-O-glycosylation is followed by 7-O-glycosylation. To examine whether a compromised flavonol 7-O-glycosylation would also lead to a reduction in flavonol content and a concomitant repression of PAL activity, the ugt89c1 ugt73c6 double mutant was generated (Fig. 1). The flavonol glycoside profile of ugt89c1 ugt73c6 leaves indicated a strongly suppressed 7-O-conjugation. The contents of the three abundant, 7-O-conjugated wild-type flavonol glycosides (f1, f2, and f3) were strongly decreased, whereas two flavonol 3-O-monoglycosides, kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside, accumulated (Fig. 8A). Yet, ugt89c1 ugt73c6 contained wild-type levels of total flavonols and had unchanged PAL enzyme activity (Figs 5, 8B).. . Fig. 8.. . Flavonol determination in ugt89c1 ugt73c6 and Col-0 leaves.

PMC4697310	Results. . Root phenotype of WT and wrky6 seedlings under different Pi concentrations. WT and wrky6 seedlings (Fig.1) were grown with/without P. indica on vertical PNM plates containing 2.5 or 0.25mM Pi for 3, 6 and 12days. A growth-promoting effect of the fungus on the seedlings development became visible 3days post incubation (dpi) and increased with decreasing Pi concentrations in the medium. In particular, root growth of both WT and wrky6 seedlings was promoted with decreasing Pi concentrations and further stimulated by the fungus (Figs.1 and 2). Closer inspection revealed that the roots are denser and bushier in the presence of P. indica because the number and lengths of both lateral roots (Figs.1 and 2a) as well as root hairs (Fig.2b-d) were increased. Furthermore, stimulation of root growth by P. indica in the WT under Pi limitation was restricted by WRKY6. This is particularly striking for seedlings grown on 0.25mM Pi (Figs.1 and 2): the growth-stimulating effect of P. indica is much stronger for wrky6 roots than WT roots (Fig.2b-d). Finally, consistent with the literature on root development after AM colonization [2], the primary root lengths of WT and wrky6 seedlings were shorter under Pi limitation conditions (Fig.2e). These results suggest that WRKY6 has a strong influence on the root architecture and that wrky6 plants perform better than WT plants both in response to P. indica and Pi limitation.Fig. 1Phenotypes of WT and wrky6 seedlings grown on 2.5mM and 0.25mM Pi in the medium. 10day-old seedlings grown on MS medium were transferred to PNM media containing the two different Pi concentrations for additional 3, 6 and 12days, either in the presence of P. indica (right panels) or plaques without the fungus (left panels). All seedlings were grown at 22C and 70-80% humidity in a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. Photos show typical view of more than 10 repetitions.

Asterisks indicate significant differences, as determined by Students paired t-test for two tailed distribution (* P0.05; ** P0.01; *** P0.001). Phenotypic differences become more obvious after long term interaction of the symbionts in expanded clay. After 14days of co-cultivation in Petri dishes, P. indica-colonized or mock-treated WT and wrky6 seedlings grown on NP (2.5mM, normal Pi) or LP (0.25mM, low Pi) media were transferred to expanded clay. After 2weeks, the first differences were observed in the size, shape and area of the leaves (Fig.3a). P. indica-colonized wrky6 seedlings were bigger under the two Pi concentrations, compared to seedlings on vertical agar plates. Although all plants showed Pi stress symptoms when grown under LP conditions for 2months, the wrky6 line performed better than the WT, and this was even more pronounced in the presence of P. indica. In particular, after 2months, a significant increase in fresh weight (Fig.3b, c) and shoot length (Fig.3d) was observed for P. indica-treated wrky6 seedlings (grown on NP medium) compared to the untreated control and the WT. This confirms that WRKY6 restricts P. indica-mediated growth promotion.Fig. 3. a Phenotypes of adult WT and wrky6 plants grown in the absence or presence of P. indica on LP or NP.

To assess the effect of Pi on root colonization, the fungal spores associated with Arabidopsis roots were stained with Trypan Blue. Fig.4a demonstrates that the number of spores associated with WT roots was higher under LP than NP conditions, and this was not observed for wrky6 seedlings. The colonization by P. indica was also confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR with the P. indica-specific marker gene EF- H, relative to the plant GAPDH gene (Fig.4b). These results highlight the strong effect of root colonization for WT seedlings grown under LP conditions (cf. Discussion).Fig. 4. a Colonization of WT and wrky6 Arabidopsis roots by P. indica after co-cultivation under 0.25mM and 2.5mM Pi concentrations in the media.

Asterisk indicates significant difference, as determined by Students paired t-test for two tailed distribution (* P0.05). . . P. indica stimulates ethylene (ET) production in LP-grown wrky6 seedlings. ET plays an important role in primary root growth and root hair formation in seedlings growing under Pi limitation [37], and has a strong influence on hyphal growth, branching and root colonization [38]. As shown in Fig.5, ET released from WT seedlings was>2-fold lower under LP than under NP conditions. The ET production of uncolonized wrky6 seedlings was comparable under the two Pi concentrations. In all instances, P. indica stimulated ET production, but significant stimulation was only observed for wrky6 seedlings. LP-, but not NP-grown mutant seedlings produced ~2-times more ET than the WT, irrespective of whether the seedlings were exposed to the fungus or not. The higher ET production of wrky6 seedlings under LP conditions compared to the WT might contribute to the change in the root architecture and the lower root colonization of the mutant (37-38, cf. Discussion).Fig. 5ET levels of WT and wrky6 seedlings which were either co-cultivated with P. indica for 2weeks or mock-treated. Data are based on 3 independent experiments with 20 plants each. Bars represent SEs. Asterisks indicate significant differences to the ET levels of seedlings grown under NP conditions, as determined by Students t-test (* P0.05; ** P0.01; *** P0.001). . . P. indica promotes PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) expression under Pi limitation. PHO1 is a high affinity Pi transporter expressed predominantly in the roots, and the gene is up-regulated under low Pi conditions [39]. We observed a ~3.8-fold stimulation of PHO1 expression by P. indica in wrky6 roots under Pi limitation, but not under NP conditions (Fig.6). This confirms previous observations that WRKY6 acts as a repressor of PHO1 expression under NP conditions. The strong effect of P. indica on root development is reflected by the up-regulation of PHO1 under Pi limitation.Fig. 6.

Figure7a shows that the radioactivity in all parts of the P. indica-exposed seedlings is higher than in non-colonized plants, irrespective of whether they were grown under NP or LP conditions, and we observed a~2-fold stimulation of 32P uptake in the presence of the fungus in both WT and wrky6 seedlings (Fig.7b). The comparable stimulation of Pi uptake by P. indica in the two genotypes demonstrates that the strong fungus-induced growth alteration in the wrky6 mutant is not exclusively caused by a more efficient Pi uptake. In addition, the total amount of Pi in the seedlings cannot explain the fungus-induced phenotypic differences between wrky6 and WT (Fig.7c). As expected, the total Pi content in the seedlings is dependent on the Pi concentration in the medium, and seedlings grown under LP conditions contain less Pi than those grown on NP conditions. However, for a given Pi concentration in the medium, we did not observe significant differences of the total Pi content in the seedlings of the two genotypes or the presence or absence of the fungus (Fig.7c). Thus, also the comparable amount of Pi in colonized and uncolonized WT and wrky6 seedlings cannot explain the differences in the root architecture observed among the seedlings grown under LP conditions (cf. Discussion).Fig. 7. 32P uptake and Pi content in WT and wrky6 seedlings exposed to P. indica (or mock-treated) under NP and LP conditions. a. 32P uptake.

Pi-regulated genes in P. indica-colonized wrky6 roots. The strongest stimulation of root growth was observed when NP-grown P. indica-colonized wrky6 seedlings were compared to those grown on LP (Figs.1 and 2). Therefore, we first identified genes which were regulated by P. indica only in wrky6 roots (and not in the WT) and only under Pi limitation (Additional file 1: Table S1). Mapman categorization revealed that 9 auxin-related genes code for small auxin up RNAs (SAURs). Others code for an auxin efflux regulator, auxin response factors (e.g. ARF12), auxin-regulated TFs (e.g. LEAF COTYLEDON2) or are auxin targets (e.g. expansins, cell wall biosynthesis enzymes). Down-regulation of IAA34, encoding a repressor of ARFs [40, 41] further supports that the auxin metabolism is activated. Two genes ([NINE-cis-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE4 [42] and HVA22 [43]) are involved in ABA functions. GA REQUIRING1, GA 20-OXIDASE3 and GA 2-OXIDASE7 are key players in gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis [44, 45].. Numerous transport processes are stimulated, as shown by the regulation of genes for p- and v-ATPases, carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, nucleotide, Pi, nitrate and metal transporters, ABC and metabolite transporters, as well as aquaporins.. Re-organisation of the root architecture is also reflected by the stimulation of genes for the primary (e.g. glucose) and secondary (e.g. stress) metabolisms, developmental processes, cell organization, cell cycle, vesicle transport, growth regulators and early signaling compounds. Among the latter group are compounds (such as the Ca2+-binding CALMODULIN-LIKE37 and receptor kinases) which have not yet been analyzed in roots. This highlights that many of the P. indica-induced responses to LP stress in the WT are restricted by WRKY6.. Interestingly, 25 miRNAs, 10 with known and 15 with unknown functions, are regulated in the bigger roots. miR156G, miR169F, miR395B and miR399C respond to Pi starvation [46, 47]. miR394B targets the mRNA for an F-box protein of the SKP1-Cullin/CDC53-F-box complex, and is involved in auxin responses [48]. miR169F targets the mRNA for the subunit A of the NF-Y TF complex thereby controlling primary and lateral root initiation [49]. Furthermore, ALKENYL HYDROXALKYL PRODUCING2 is involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis and predicted to be targeted by miR826 and miR5090, and both miRNAs are induced in response to Pi starvation [50]. All these miRNAs are regulated by P. indica in LP-exposed wrky6, but not WT roots. This highlights the importance of this TF on the restriction of root development under Pi limitation.. A functional categorization of genes based on a) involvement in biological process, b) involvement in molecular function, c) involvement in cellular component and regulated more than 2-fold in response to LP based on A. thaliana Gene Ontology (TAIRs GO annotations) is given in (Fig. 8).. . . Proposed list of general genes involved in root growth promotion. The Venn-diagrams (Fig.9) generated by the MAPMAN software identified genes, which were regulated by LP (but not P. indica or WRKY6), by P. indica (but not LP or WRKY6), and by WRKY6 (but not P. indica or LP). The common genes among these three datasets are not specific for one of the three stimuli and should therefore represent more general genes involved in the promotion of root growth and development (Fig.9). Those genes were then arranged according to their average fold regulation in all datasets (Table1, 4-fold; Additional file 2: Table S2). The higher the genes are ranked in the list, the more important appears to be their requirement during root growth.Fig. 9Common up- and down-regulated genes (>4 fold) in Arabidopsis roots regulated either by Pi limitation, WRKY6 or P. indica (Venn diagram).

For 28 of them, we could not find sufficient information to predict a function of their products. In addition, for 59 gene products, we did not find functional analysis data or predictions for roots.. It appears that root growth is associated with water shortage (At1g26850) and a high demand for sugar (At5g62850). SWEET5 appears to play a major role in providing photoassimilates via the phloem to the roots and for the fungus, as its message is the only one of the SWEET sucrose efflux transporter gene family [51] in the list. The auxin/cytokinin ratio is important for root/shoot ratios. Only 3 genes involved in the auxin and cytokinin metabolism are in the list: SAUR2 participating in cell expansion, an auxin-inducible uncharacterized leucine-rich repeat protein (At1g24650) [52] and the predicted TF At5g27140 which responds to cytokinin through the histidine-to-aspartate photorelay circuit [53]. Interestingly, no other hormone-related genes were highly ranked among the common genes.. Among the proteins known to be involved in cell wall extension such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylase-hydrolases, expansins, polygalacturonases or peroxidases, the uncharacterized pectin methylesterases At1g69940 and At1g11590 appear to be important. Cell growth requires an increase in exocytosis, which is reflected by the highly ranked SNF7 gene in the list. SNF7 is involved in internal vesicle formation of the prevascular compartment [54]. Specific members of gene families (such as At1g07725 of the EXOCYST70 family) participate in the stimulation of the export in growing cells. The increased demand for lipids is reflected by genes involved in lipid metabolism (At4g33355; At1g21540). Control of the redox potential (At3g45880, At2g33270) and specific plastid functions, such as the import into the organelle (At5g07930), appear to be important. Rapid responses to developmental changes have been associated with posttranscriptional processes mediated by PUMILIO proteins (At5g56510) [55]. Closer inspection of the genes regulated>4-fold using the TAIR and NCBI databases revealed that additional not well characterized proteins are potentially associated with root or cell growth, but this requires further studies. In addition, extension of the list of genes by reducing the threshold level to 2-fold regulation in all three conditions (Additional file 2: Table S2, 2-fold) uncovered additional~100 proteins with predicted growth related functions (TAIR homepage), such as REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM1, GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR4, EXPANSIN23, the RmIC-like cupin protein At1g03890, HISTONE ACETYLASE18, the Ca2+-dependent PROTEIN KINASE14, LIFEGUARD1 and SYNAPTOTAGMIN2, to mention a few. Finally, the function of the strongly down-regulated HVA22J-like PROTEINJ needs to be analyzed.. In summary, very limited information is available for the majority of the genes which respond to the three root growth stimulators analyzed in this study..

The treatment triggered a substantial response with the expression of 431 genes affected (P < 0.05 and log2  1 or  -1) already after 30 min and that of 3915 genes affected after 9 h of exposure, most of the affected genes being upregulated. These are involved in a considerable number of different biological processes, some of which are described in detail: glucosinolate metabolism, sulphate uptake and assimilation, heat stress response, oxidative stress response, elicitor perception, plant defence and cell death mechanisms..
PMC3177185	RESULTSIn silico identification of ALKBH8/Trm9-like proteins in plantsDuring our efforts to characterize the mammalian ALKBH8 protein, we became intrigued by the observation that the RRM/AlkB and MT functions of ALKBH8 appeared to be encoded by two separate genes in plants. A protein BLAST search using human ALKBH8 as query retrieved two major hits in Arabidopsis, encoded by the genes At1g31600 and At1g36310. The protein encoded by At1g31600 displays high similarity to the N-terminal part of ALKBH8, encompassing the RRM and AlkB domains, and will be referred to as AtALKBH8. The protein encoded by At1g36310 is highly similar to the C-terminal MT domain of human ALKBH8, as well as to the S. cerevisiae Trm9 protein, and was denoted AtTRM9. Putative orthologues of these two ALKBH8/Trm9-like proteins were found in other plants, such as rice (Oryza sativa) and grape (Vitis vinifera), showing that the separation of the dioxygenase and MT functions of ALKBH8 into two proteins, as observed in Arabidopsis, applies to both monocots and eudicots, and therefore might apply to land plants in general. Alignments of AtALKBH8 and AtTRM9 with putative orthologues from various organisms are shown in Figure 1A and B, respectively.. Figure 1.Protein sequence alignment of AtALKB8 and AtTRM9 with putative orthologues from selected organisms. Functional domains are indicated by dotted (RRM motif), solid (AlkB-like) and dashed (Trm9-like) lines above the alignment. (A) Alignment of AtALKBH8 and putative orthologues. The upstream T-DNA insertion sites in the atalkbh8-1 and atalkbh8-2 lines are indicated by closed and open triangles, respectively. Gene identifier numbers: Hs, Homo sapiens, gi|195927059; Dm, Drosophila melanogaster, gi|24658267; At, Arabidopsis thaliana, gi|42571711; Vv, Vitis vinifera, gi|225427651; Os, Oryza sativa, gi|50928501 and Ce, Caenorhabditis elegans, gi|17552176. (B) Alignment of AtTRM9 and putative orthologues. The upstream T-DNA insertion site in the attrm9 line corresponds to Arg9 in the protein sequence (which is located in the non-conserved N-terminal part of the protein not included in the alignment). Gene identifier numbers: At, gi|18400083; Vv, gi|225459401; Os, gi|115448705; Hs, gi|195927059; Dm, gi|24658267; Ce, Caenorhabditis elegans, gi|17552176 and Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, gi|6323627 (note that the gi numbers for AtALKBH8 and AtTRM9 homologues are identical in animals, where these two functions are carried out by a single protein).Annotation data, as well as available ESTs and cDNAs, suggest that alternative splicing may give rise to two different forms of the AtALKBH8 protein (Figure 2A and B). A 7 exon gene model (At1g31600.1) encodes a 431 amino acids protein (AtALKBH8a), whereas the alternative 8 exon model (At1g31600.2) encodes a 344 amino acids protein (AtALKBH8b) (Figure 2B). AtALKBH8a represents an extension of AtALKBH8b by 83 amino acids, but this extension shares no detectable sequence homology with any other proteins in the NCBI protein sequence database. Putative ALKBH8 orthologues from other plants lack a corresponding extension, and they are generally very similar in size to the 344 amino acids AtALKBH8b protein, to which they align throughout their entire sequence. Interestingly, the 159nt DNA sequence encoding the N-terminal part (53 amino acids) of the 83 amino acid extension is highly similar (94% sequence identity) to the Ac-type transposon Tag2. This transposon, and inactive remnants thereof, are found in numerous copies throughout the Arabidopsis genome, indicating that the alternative splice form may have arisen through a transposition event (29). RT-PCR experiments showed that mRNAs corresponding to both forms of AtALKBH8 were expressed in all tissues examined (stamen, rosette leaves, flowers and silique) (Figure 2C).. Figure 2.Architecture of the AtALKBH8 and AtTRM9 genes and characterization of corresponding T-DNA insertion lines. (A) Schematic view of the domain architecture of ALKBH8 and TRM9 proteins from various organisms. The N-terminal extension present in the 431 amino acid splice variant of AtALKBH8 is indicated by a dotted box, and gradient shading indicates the part of this extension, which shows strong homology to the Tag2 transposon. The RNA recognition motif is shown in black, the AlkB oxygenase in dark grey, and the methyltransferase domain is shown in light grey. (B) Schematic view of AtALKBH8 and AtTRM9. Exons are indicated by boxes, where putatively untranslated regions are shown in light grey and translated regions are shown in dark grey. Annotated start codons (ATG) are indicated by arrows. The upstream T-DNA insertion sites are indicated by triangles. The two alternative gene models for the AtALKBH8 locus, which give rise to the two different forms of the AtALKBH8 protein, are indicated. (C) Expression of mRNA encoding the two forms of AtALKBH8 in various tissues. RT-PCR on mRNA from different tissues was performed, using primers amplifying fragments of 1882 and 1302bp representing gene model AtALKBH8a and AtALKBH8b, respectively. Genomic DNA was used as positive control (note that the genomic fragment is larger due to intron sequences). The ACTIN2-7 gene, giving a fragment of 255bp with primers spanning intron 2, amplified at comparable levels from all tissues, with no genomic contamination as indicated by the band of 340bp fragment representing genomic DNA that is only seen in the genomic DNA control lane. M: Molecular weight marker. (D) Sequence determination of the insertion sites in the T-DNA lines. Precise location of the T-DNA in the AtALKBH8 and AtTRM9 genes are shown for the different lines. Exon sequences are shown in uppercase letters and left and right border (LB and RB) T-DNA sequences are underlined. Filler sequences are indicated as fill, while deletion of genomic DNA is marked by delta. Numbers indicate the position of the insertion sites in the gene sequence. (E) Expression analysis of WT and mutant T-DNA lines by RT-PCR. Regions of the respective AtALKBH8 (left panel) and AtTRM9 (right panel) genes, together with relevant primer pairs (upstream, downstream or spanning the T-DNA integration site) are indicated below. For each primer set, expression analysis was conducted on mRNA from WT and different T-DNA lines as indicate above. Ctr refers to a negative control PCR sample run without cDNA, and M indicates marker lane.Two different gene models for the At1g36310 gene have been predicted, consisting of two or three exons. The transcripts resulting from these gene models only differ in their 5-UTR, and both encode the same 404 amino acid AtTRM9 protein. Available cDNAs and ESTs primarily support the three exon model, which is shown in Figure 2B. RT-PCR experiments showed that the mRNA for AtTRM9, were expressed in all tissues examined (stamen, rosette leaves, flowers and silique) (data not shown).Genomic characterization of mutant plants with T-DNA insertions in the genes-encoding AtALKBH8 and AtTRM9To investigate the role of the AtALKBH8 and AtTRM9 proteins in tRNA modification in planta, T-DNA insertion lines were obtained for AtALKBH8 (atalkbh8-1, SALK_083838C; atalkbh8-2, SALK_094502C) and AtTRM9 (attrm9, SALK_135308). The T-DNA in the atalkbh8 lines is inserted into the gene in such a way that it disrupts the AlkB domain, while the T-DNA in the attrm9 line is inserted shortly downstream of the translational start site in the AtTRM9 gene (Figures 1 and 2B).The annotated T-DNA insertions were further verified by sequencing of PCR products spanning the individual integration sites. At the LB junction in SALK_083838C (atalkbh8-1), the insertion point was determined to be after position 2757 in the genomic sequence of the At1g31600 gene, corresponding to position 1634 in the mRNA sequence (NM_102896) (Figure 2D). A filler of 1bp had been inserted between the genomic DNA and the T-DNA at this border. At the RB integration site in atalkbh8-1, the insertion point was determined to be at genomic position 2755 in the At1g31600 gene, corresponding to position 1632 in the mRNA sequence (NM_102896). At this junction, a filler consisting of 20bp scrambled genomic DNA had been integrated. Also, part of the RB sequence of the T-DNA had been deleted. In SALK_094502C (atalkbh8-2), there are two LB sequences integrated (Figure 2D). The integration was verified to be at position 2700 in the genomic sequence of the At1g31600 gene, corresponding to position 1577 in the mRNA sequence (NM_102896). A filler of 30bp was inserted between the genomic DNA and the T-DNA at this junction. The other LB junction was determined to be at genomic position 2764, corresponding to position 1642 in the mRNA sequence, showing a deletion of 64bp at the integration site. A filler of 25bp had been integrated at this site. Also in the SALK_135308 (attrm9) line, two LB sequences have been integrated (Figure 2D). The integration site of the upstream LB was determined to be at position 243 in the genomic sequence of the At1g36310 gene, corresponding to position 161 in the mRNA sequence (NM_103320). The downstream LB junction was determined to be at position 264 in the genomic sequence, corresponding to position 183 in the mRNA sequence, giving a deletion of 20bp genomic DNA. In addition, a filler sequence of 27bp of unknown origin was integrated at the junction.We performed RT-PCR experiments in order to determine the expression level in the homozygous mutant lines. For the atalkbh8-1 and atalkbh8-2 alleles, primer pairs annealing upstream as well as downstream of the T-DNA integration site were utilized. Expression could be detected on both sides of the T-DNA insert, although considerably weaker expression was observed downstream as compared to upstream of the integration site (Figure 2E, left panel). Such downstream expression due to cryptic promoters inside the T-DNA has been shown for several other T-DNA insertion lines (30,31). However, since the T-DNA insertions in the atalkbh8-1 and atalkbh8-2 lines both disrupt the conserved AlkB domain of AtALKBH8, we consider it highly unlikely that a functional protein will be generated. In the attrm9 mutant, expression downstream of the T-DNA integration site was virtually absent (Figure 2E, right panel). Full-length mRNA spanning the insertion site could not be detected in any of the mutants.Wobble uridine modification pattern of attrm9 and atalkbh8 plantsThe characterization of the T-DNA insertion lines shown above clearly indicated that these lines represented knockout plants with respect to the AtTRM9 or AtALKBH8 functions. However, when grown in soil, none of the homozygous mutant lines displayed any obvious morphological or developmental phenotype when compared to WT. Furthermore, the germination efficiency of seeds from these plants, as measured by scoring of testa rupture, as well as root growth were similar to that of WT plants (data not shown).In order to investigate the potential role of these proteins in the modification of wobble uridines, we measured the levels of various modified uridines (Table 1) in total tRNA from WT and mutant plants. Total tRNA from Arabidopsis seedlings was digested into nucleosides and subsequently analysed by LC-MS/MS. The modifications ncm5U, mcm5s2U and (S)-mchm5U were abundant in total tRNA from WT Arabidopsis, and small amounts of cm5U, and mcm5U were also detected (Figure 3). In addition, small amounts of ncm5s2U appeared to be present, but we were not able to firmly establish the presence of this modification, due to an interfering peak with similar LC retention time, and identical MS fragmentation pattern (data not shown). In contrast to the modification pattern observed in WT plants, mcm5s2U, (S)-mchm5U and mcm5U were all virtually absent in tRNA from attrm9 mutant plants, while the level of cm5U, the unmethylated precursor of mcm5U, was strongly increased (Figure 3). The levels of ncm5U were similar in attrm9 and WT plants, which is different from results obtained in mice and yeast, where inactivation of the Trm9 (ALKBH8-MT) function lead to an increase in the levels of this modification, as well as of the 2-thiolated derivative ncm5s2U (4,20). These results strongly indicate that AtTRM9 is a functional Trm9 homologue, which is required for the generation of mcm5U in plants.. Figure 3.Wobble uridine modification status in WT, atalkbh8 and attrm9 plants. Total tRNA isolated from WT or mutant plants was degraded to nucleosides, and the levels of the indicated modified nucleosides were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis. The relative level of each individual modification is expressed relative to the total amount of all the shown modifications. Error bars indicate the standard deviation between triplicate samples.. Table 1.Overview of uridine modifications studied in the present workThe -CH3 and -OH groups introduced by AtTRM9 and AtTRM8, respectively, are indicated in bold.tRNA isolated from AtALKBH8-deficient plants completely lacked (S)-mchm5U, but showed a strong increase in the levels of its precursor, mcm5U (Figure 3), supporting the notion that AtALKBH8, like the mammalian orthologue, catalyses the hydroxylation of mcm5U into (S)-mchm5U. Both atalkbh8-1 and atalkbh8-2 mutant plants showed a virtually identical pattern of aberrant modification. Interestingly, mcm5Um, the 2-O-ribose methylated form of mcm5U, which is present at very low levels in WT plants, was dramatically increased (20-fold) in atalkbh8 tRNA, indicating that a substantial portion of the accumulated mcm5U is subjected to ribose methylation (Figure 3).Modification status of  in attrm9 and atalkbh8 plants(S)-mchm5U has been detected in a variety of ALKBH8-containing eukaryotes, including Arabidopsis, and it has been demonstrated that  from mouse, calf and silkworm contains this modification in the wobble position (12,32). The primary sequence of Arabidopsis  (retrieved from the Genomic tRNA database; http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/) is highly similar to that of silkworm and mammals, and the anticodon loop is identical (Figure 4A), suggesting that also this tRNA may carry an (S)-mchm5U modification. To investigate whether this is the case, an immobilized oligonucleotide of complementary sequence to  was used to specifically isolate this isoacceptor from total tRNA. Nucleoside analysis by LC-MS/MS clearly demonstrated a strong enrichment of (S)-mchm5U and the corresponding demethylated derivative, 5-[carboxy(hydroxy)methyl]uridine (chm5U), in the isolated  isoacceptor, relative to total tRNA (Figure 4B and C). Note that the LC-MS/MS method used was not able to distiguish between the R and S diastereomers of chm5U. The observed chm5U is probably the result of spontaneous hydrolysis of the ester bond in (S)-mchm5U, as previously reported (12). These results strongly indicated that the (S)-mchm5U modification is present in  also in Arabidopsis.. Figure 4.Wobble uridine modifications on  in WT, atalkbh8 and attrm9 plants. (A) Alignment of  from selected organisms. A solid line indicates the sequence corresponding to the anticodon loop, while the anticodon is indicated by a dotted line. (B) Enrichment of (S)-mchm5U in  relative to WT total tRNA. LC-MS/MS analysis of (S)-mchm5U in Arabidopsis  and in total tRNA. (C) Comparison of modification patterns in isolated  with that in total tRNA. Nucleosides were quantitated by LC-MS/MS analysis. (D) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the anticodon fragment of  from WT, atalkbh8 and attrm9 plants. Digestion of  with RNase T1, which cleaves 3 to G residues generated the anticodon fragment (indicated by a solid line in A) of primary sequence CCUUCCAAG (the wobble nucleotide is indicated). Peaks corresponding to mchm5U, chm5U, mcm5U cm5U and ncm5U in the wobble position, as well as the measured masses, are indicated. An asterisk indicates minor signals from the 2-3-cyclic phosphate version of the fragment (the 3-phosphate version represents the major signal). Theoretical monoisotopic mass of an anticodon fragment containing the various modifications: chm5U, 2928.38; (S)-mchm5U, 2942.40; mcm5U, 2926.40; ncm5U, 2911.40; cm5U, 2912.39.To study the roles of AtALKBH8 and AtTRM9 in wobble uridine modification specifically in , this isoacceptor was isolated from attrm9 and atalkbh8-1 plants. The purified isoacceptor was then digested with RNase T1, which specifically cleaves 3 to G residues, and the resulting fragments were analysed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Based on genomic tRNA sequence, the anticodon triplet of  is expected to be present in a 9-mer fragment of sequence CCUUCCAAG (the putatively modified wobble uridine is underlined). Indeed, fragments corresponding to mchm5U and chm5U modifications were detected in  from WT plants (Figure 4D, upper panel); a modification pattern very similar to that observed for mammalian  (12). It should be noted that, due to isotope distributions, each fragment gives rise to a cluster of peaks of 1Da spacing, where the leftmost peak corresponds to the monoisotopic mass.When  from atalkbh8-1 plants was analysed, the peak cluster corresponding to mchm5U was absent, but instead a cluster corresponding to mcm5U was observed (Figure 4D, middle panel), indicating that the (S)-mchm5U modification on  is generated by AtALKBH8-mediated hydroxylation of mcm5U.  derived from attrm9 plants gave rise to a peak cluster that was shifted 31 Da relative to the mchm5U-containing cluster. Here, the first (leftmost) peak corresponds to the monoisotopic mass of ncm5U, whereas the second peak corresponds to the monoisotopic mass of cm5U (Figure 4D, lower panel). Since the first peak is substantially smaller than the second one, and thereby deviates from the expected isotope pattern of a single oligonucleotide, it is highly likely that the peak cluster represents both ncm5U and cm5U. This is also supported by our analysis of total tRNA from attrm9 plants, which showed an accumulation of cm5U (Figure 3), as well as by our previous study from mice lacking ALKBH8-MT (the functional equivalent of Trm9), which revealed the presence of both cm5U and ncm5U in  (12). The already high levels of ncm5U in total tRNA, due to the natural occurrence of this modification in many different tRNA isoacceptors, may explain why the partial modification of attrm9  by ncm5U was not manifested as a significant increase in the ncm5U level in total attrm9 tRNA (Figure 3). Taken together, the data presented above show that  in Arabidopsis harbors an (S)-mchm5U modification in the wobble position, which depends on both AtALKBH8 and AtTRM9 for its biogenesis.The activity of AtTRM9 depends on co-expressed AtTRM112a or AtTRM112bIn mammals, the MT domain of ALKBH8 requires a small accessory protein, TRM112, to form a functional enzymatic complex (20), and it has also been shown that a similar complex is formed between yeast Trm112 and Trm9 (33). Recently, the gene At1g22270 was shown to encode a functional Arabidopsis homologue of TRM112, denoted SMALL ORGAN 2 (SMO2), since smo2 mutants show retarded organ growth due to inhibition of G2-M phase progression during organogenesis (34). In addition to SMO2, Arabidopsis has another similar protein, SMO2L (small organ 2-like), encoded by the gene At1g78190, and this protein has 78% sequence identity to SMO2. To better indicate their similarity to yeast Trm112, and to comply with the nomenclature from the NCBI protein database, we have chosen to denote these proteins AtTRM112a (SMO2) and AtTRM112b (SMO2L). Since both Trm9 and Trm112 are conserved between mammals, yeast and plants, we considered it likely that AtTRM9 may, similarly, form a functional complex with AtTRM112a or AtTRM112b. To test this, 6xHis-tagged AtTRM9 (6xHis-AtTRM9) was co-expressed in E. coli together with untagged AtTRM112a or AtTRM112b, and then affinity purified on TALON beads, to which 6xHis tagged proteins bind strongly. As shown in Figure 5A, a band of 14kDa, corresponding in size to AtTRM112a or AtTRM112b, was present on the gel after co-expression of AtTRM112a or AtTRM112b with 6xHis-AtTRM9, but not after expression of either protein alone. These results suggested that untagged AtTRM112a/b co-purified with 6xHis-AtTRM9, and that these proteins form an enzymatic complex.. Figure 5.Activity of recombinant enzymes on WT and mutant tRNA. (A) Co-expression of untagged AtTRM112a and AtTRM112b with 6xHis-AtTRM9. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity chromatography on TALON beads, and then analysed by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands corresponding to AtTRM112a or AtTRM112b and AtTRM9 are indicated by arrows. Non-specific bands representing endogenous E. coli proteins are indicated by asterisks. (B) Dependence of the MT activity of AtTRM9 on co-expressed AtTRM112a or AtTRM112b. The activity was assayed on 10g saponified yeast tRNA using different amounts of recombinant enzyme. (C) AtTRM9 methyltransferase activity on tRNA from attrm9 plants. 20pmol AtTRM9/AtTRM112a complex was incubated with 5g of total tRNA from attrm9 or WT plants, or from calf liver (CL). (D) Cross-species activity of human ALKBH8-Ox on atalkbh8 tRNA. Different amounts of human ALKBH8-Ox was incubated with total tRNA from atalkbh8 plants. The tRNA was then digested to nucleosides, and the level of mcm5U (closed circles) and (S)-mchm5U (open circles) was measured by LC-MS/MS analysis.The altered wobble uridine modification pattern in the AtTRM9-deficient plants indicated that this enzyme may have a function equivalent to that of yeast Trm9 and the MT moiety of mammalian ALKBH8. To investigate the putative enzymatic activity of AtTRM9 and to address the functional significance of the suggested interaction between AtTRM9 and AtTRM112a/b, purified 6xHis-AtTRM9, in the absence or presence of co-expressed AtTRM112a/AtTRM112b, was assayed for tRNA methyltransferase activity. We have previously observed that yeast tRNA, which is easily obtained in large quantities, is a good substrate for the MT activity of human ALKBH8 (20), and we therefore, considered it likely that this also may be the case for AtTRM9. To generate a substrate for the putative AtTrm9 MT activity, the yeast tRNA was subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis referred to as saponification. This treatment causes hydrolysis of the methyl ester bond in mcm5U and mcm5s2U, resulting in their conversion to the putative AtTRM9 substrates cm5U and 5-carboxymethyl-2-thiouridine (cm5s2U), respectively. When saponified yeast tRNA was incubated with the radiolabelled methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine and with 6xHis-AtTRM9 that had been co-expressed with AtTRM112a or AtTRM112b, incorporation of radioactivity into tRNA was observed, supporting the notion that AtTRM9 is a functional Trm9 homolog (Figure 5B). Importantly, no incorporation of radioactivity was observed when AtTRM9 had been expressed and purified in the absence of either AtTRM112a or AtTRM112b, suggesting that interaction with AtTRM112a or AtTRM112b is required for AtTRM9 to exert its MT activity (Figure 5B).The accumulation of cm5U in tRNA from the attrm9 mutant plants suggested that this tRNA may function as a MT-substrate even without saponification. Indeed, non-saponified tRNA from attrm9 plants gave a substantially higher level of AtTRM9/AtTRM112a-mediated methylation, compared to tRNA from WT plants (Figure 5C), further supporting the notion that AtTRM9 catalyses the methylation of cm5U into mcm5U.Human ALKBH8-Ox hydroxylates mcm5U to (S)-mchm5U in tRNA obtained from AtALKBH8 knock-out plantsTo investigate the enzymatic activity of AtALKBH8 in vitro, we attempted to express and purify the recombinant protein from E. coli, but we were unable to recover soluble protein. Instead, we addressed whether the mcm5U-modified tRNA found in the atalkbh8 mutant plant can function as a substrate for the ALKBH8 oxygenase activity, by treating this tRNA with the dioxygenase domain (amino acids 1-354) of human ALKBH8 (ALKBH8-Ox) and subsequently analyzed the modification status by LC-MS/MS. With increasing concentrations of enzyme, we observed an increase of (S)-mchm5U levels accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in mcm5U (Figure 5D). However, a fraction of the mcm5U-modified tRNA appeared refractory to HsALKBH8-Ox-mediated hydroxylation, probably reflecting mcm5U-containing isoacceptors that are not subject to further hydroxylation. These data further support that mcm5U is the precursor of (S)-mchm5U also in plants, and that AtALKBH8 is the enzyme catalyzing the hydroxylation of mcm5U to (S)-mchm5U..
PMC4265158	Results. . Characterization of Arabidopsis mutants gln1;1, gln1;2, and gln1;1:gln1;2. . In order to study the effect of a loss of function of Gln1;1 and Gln1;2, homozygous single and double mutants were identified and analysed at the GS gene and protein level. RT-PCR analysis showed that Gln1;1 was expressed at a much lower level than Gln1;2 in Wt plants (Fig. 1A). Gln1;1 expression was absent in gln1;1 and gln1;1:gln1;2, and Gln1;2 expression was absent in gln1;2 and gln1;1:gln1;2 (Fig. 1A). At the protein level, the relative amounts of GS1 and GS2 in crude protein extracted from shoots of gln1;1, gln1;2, gln1;1:gln1;2, and the Wt were estimated by western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). In Wt shoots, two polypeptides were detected. The ~45kDa polypeptide corresponds to GS2, whereas the ~40kDa polypeptide corresponds to GS1. In gln1;2 and gln1;1:gln1;2, a prominent decrease in GS1 protein content was observed, showing that Gln1;2 is the main shoot isoform in the Arabidopsis GS1 multigene family. In gln1;1, a similar amount of GS1 protein to that in the Wt was observed (Fig. 1B). This reflects the contribution of protein from other GS1 isoforms, including an up-regulated Gln1;2 (Guan, 2014).. . Fig. 1.. . Identification of Arabidopsis mutants gln1;1, gln1;2, and gln1;1:gln1;2. (A) RT-PCR analysis of Gln1;1 and Gln1;2 expression in the roots of the wild-type (Wt), gln1;1, gln1;2, and gln1;1:gln1;2 plants. UBQ2 was used as a reference gene for equal amounts of cDNA in different samples. Each sample contained a pool of roots from five individual plants. (B) Western blot analysis of GS1 and GS2 contents in shoots of Wt, gln1;1, gln1;2, and gln1;1:gln1;2 plants. The upper band corresponds to GS2, and the lower band corresponds to GS1. The same amount of crude protein was loaded in each lane, as described in the Materials and methods. Each sample contained a pool of shoots from five individual plants.. . . . . . Early seedling establishment and N remobilization from cotyledons are impaired in Gln1;2 knockout mutants. Seedling size after 2 weeks of growth in soil was distinctly smaller in the mutants compared with the Wt (Fig. 2A). The size of both the cotyledons and the first real leaf was reduced, most pronouncedly in the gln1;1:gln1;2 double mutant, followed by the gln1;2 mutant and the gln1;1 mutant. The slower seedling development in the mutants suggests a function for Gln1;2 and, to a lesser extent, Gln1;1 in N remobilization during seed germination and seedling establishment when N stored in the cotyledons is required to sustain the growth of new sink leaves.. .

Plants were grown in soil for 2 weeks. Results are means SE (n=4). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between the lines, determined using Students t-test: *P<0.05; **P<0.01. Two independent experiments were carried out with similar results. Scale bars=2000 mum.. . . . In order to investigate if there was a difference in N remobilization between mutants and the Wt, the N concentration in cotyledons and first rosette leaves was analysed. Plants were grown in soil for 2 weeks, during which period they developed two rosette leaves (Fig. 2A). The Wt plants had a markedly higher N concentration in the new sink leaves than in the source cotyledons (Fig. 2B). The same was the case for the gln1;1 single mutant, although the difference in N concentration between sink and source leaves was much smaller than in the Wt (Fig. 2B). Both the gln1;2 and the gln1;1:gln1;2 mutants behaved in an opposite manner to the Wt and the gln1;1 mutant by having a higher N concentration in the source cotyledons compared with the sink leaves (Fig. 2B). This difference was due to the fact that a significantly (P=0.01) higher N concentration was maintained in the cotyledons of the two Gln1;2 knockout mutants gln1;2 and gln1;1:gln1;2 relative to the Wt (Fig. 2B), showing that N remobilization from seed reserves in cotyledons was markedly reduced when Gln1;2 was lacking.. . . Seed germination is impaired in the gln1;2 knockout mutants but the defect can be alleviated by exogenous N. In the absence of exogenous N supply (-N), the cotyledons emerging during the first 2 DAS of gln1;2 and gln1;1:gln1;2 seeds were breaking through the seed coat more slowly (Fig. 3A) and were distinctly smaller than those from Wt and gln1;1 seeds (Fig. 3B). In order to study if this phenotype was associated with N deficiency due to reduced N remobilization from seed reserves, an exogenous N supply was applied in the form of nitrate at a normal (5mM) or high (20mM) level to modified 1/2 MS medium.. . Fig. 3.. . Characterization of Arabidopsis mutants gln1;1, gln1;2, and gln1;1:gln1;2 in early stages of seed germination. (A) Stereo microscopy images of the wild type and mutants on day 1. (B) Stereo microscopy images of the wild type and mutants on day 2. (C) Primary root length of the wild type and mutants at day 6 (n=16-18). The wild-type and mutant seeds were placed onto three different N treatment plates modified from 1/2 MS medium: high-nitrate medium (HN), normal-nitrate medium (Normal), and no-nitrogen medium (-N), as indicated on the left hand side. Plates were placed quasi-vertically. Similar images for (A) and (B) were acquired from four individual seedlings.. . . . Addition of N enhanced seed germination (Fig. 3A) and cotyledon size (Fig. 3B) of the gln1;2 single mutant compared with the -N treatment. At the high level of N supply, the seedling establishment of gln1;2 was almost fully recovered. In the gln1;1 mutant, the length of the primary root was negatively affected (P=0.05) by exogenous N supply (Fig. 3C), suggesting a function for Gln1;1 with respect to primary root development in response to external N. The gln1;1:gln1;2 double mutant had a noticeably retarded germination at all N levels (Fig. 3). Only the radicle was visible at day 1 (Fig. 3A), and the cotyledons were much smaller and had started to turn yellow at day 2 (Fig. 3B). The primary roots developed by gln1;1:gln1;2 were significantly (P=0.01) shorter than in the Wt under high and normal N conditions, but longer in the -N treatment (Fig. 3C).. . . Seed yield is significantly reduced in Gln1;2 knockout mutants. Seed formation requires N remobilization from senescing vegetative plant parts as the N uptake and assimilation during seed filling is insufficient to fulfil the high N demand of the seeds. In order to resolve how knockout of Gln1;1 or/and Gln1;2 affects seed production, the seed yield structure in the reproductive growth stage of single and double knockout mutants was characterized.. Both mutants and the Wt bolted after 7 weeks of growth and developed a main inflorescence stem, with side branches developing after 8 weeks (Fig. 4A). A significantly lower number of siliques was formed in gln1;2 and gln1;1:gln1;2 compared with the Wt (Figs 4A, 5A). The decrease in silique number was due to both a lower silique set on the main inflorescence stem (23% reduction for gln1;2 and 27% for gln1;1:gln1;2 relative to Wt) and a lower silique set on the side branches (32% and 27% reduction for gln1;2 and gln1;1:gln1;2, respectively; Fig. 5A). One week later, at 9 weeks, a significantly lower number of siliques on both the main inflorescence stem and the side branches was still observed in the gln1;1:gln1;2 double mutant (Fig. 5B).. .

Shorter siliques were observed in gln1;2 and gln1;1:gln1;2 (Fig. 4B), and the size of the mature viable seeds of gln1;2 and gln1;1:gln1;2 was smaller relative to that of Wt seeds (Fig. 4C). The seed number per fully developed silique was determined in 10 mature siliques collected from the bottom part of the main inflorescence stem at 10 weeks. Both gln1;2 and gln1;1:gln1;2 had an ~17% (P=0.01) lower number of seeds per mature silique compared with the Wt (Fig. 6A). In addition, the dry weight of the individual seeds was reduced by 10% in gln1;2 (P=0.05) and by 18% in gln1;1:gln1;2 (P=0.01) (Fig. 6B). The lower seed number and seed dry weight resulted in 20% lower (P=0.05) seed yield in the single mutant gln1;2 and a 35% lower (P=0.01) seed yield in the double mutant gln1;1:gln1;2 (Fig. 6A-C). This clearly shows a crucial role for Gln1;2 with respect to the seed yield structure in Arabidopsis.. . Fig. 6.. .

Seed N concentration is unaffected in Arabidopsis mutants gln1;1, gln1;2, and gln1;1:gln1;2. . The N concentration in the seed dry matter was determined for the mutants and the Wt (Fig. 6D). No significant differences were found between mutants and the Wt with respect to seed N concentration.. . . . Gln1;1 and Gln1;2 are expressed in different cell types in Arabidopsis. . In order to investigate the localization of Gln1;2 expression, the ProGln1;2-NLS-GFP-GUS promoter-reporter construct was transformed into Arabidopsis. Confocal microscopy of the transgenic roots showed a strong GFP fluorescence in the endodermis of the mature root and in the vasculature of the basal region of lateral roots (Fig. 7A, B). In vegetative shoots, the expression of Gln1;2 occurred in mesophyll and vascular bundle cells (Guan, 2014). During reproductive growth, bright GFP signals were detected in the epidermal cells of sepals (Fig. 7C). Besides that, fluorescence from Gln1;2 expression was restricted to cells in the vascular bundle along the veins of petals (Fig. 7D), in the vascular bundle of stamens (Fig. 7E), and in nodes between the pedicel and the developing silique (Fig. 7F). This localization of Gln1;2 in vascular bundles of floral and reproductive organs agrees with a role for Gln1;2 in ammonium assimilation for seed production.. . Fig. 7.. .

The GFP signal driven by the Gln1;1 promoter was recorded in the epidermal cells of the root elongation zone (Supplementary Fig. S1 available at JXB online). This localization supports the observed role of Gln1;1 in controlling primary root development in interaction with external N availability during seedling early growth (Fig. 3C)..
PMC2772814	Results. . Mutation in ASHH2 results in a pleiotropic phenotype. Four ashh2 alleles were analyzed; with T-DNAs inserted in the promoter 643 bp upstream of the translation start (ashh2-6), in the first intron (ashh2-2/sdg8-2), in the sixth exon (ashh2-5) and the sixth intron/seventh exon (ashh2-1/sdg8-1), respectively (Figure 1A, Table 1). In the latter three alleles the ASHH2 expression levels are strongly reduced compared to wt (Figure 1B). These alleles are not expected to produce functional proteins, as the T-DNAs are positioned upstream of or in the region encoding the SET domain, suggesting that they are null alleles. Plants homozygous for ashh2-1, ashh2-2 and ashh2-5 show a characteristic dwarf and bushy phenotype (Figures 1C and 1H, and Figure S1). This phenotype was not found in ashh2-6 plants, the only allele that can be expected to produce a normal transcript and for which the expression level in inflorescences was only reduced to 55% (Figure 1B and Figure S1). We have mainly focused on the phenotypes found to be common to all alleles. All ashh2 organs were smaller than wt organs (Figures 1D and 1E). Stamens were shorter with thinner filaments that often were bent just beneath the anther, while the carpels were shorter and thicker compared to wt (Figure 1F). ashh2 siliques developed poorly (Figure 1G), and flowering and growth continued for at least 100 days (Figure 1H). These plants had highly branched internodes (Figure 1I) and composite or clustered flowers without pedicels (Figure 1J).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0007817.g001. Figure 1. . Alleles of ashh2 and the pleiotropic phenotype of ashh2 mutant plants.. (A) Position of the T-DNA insertions of different SALK lines as indicated. The 15 exons of ASHH2 are shown as black boxes and the introns as thin lines. Numbers refer to base pairs (bp) in the Arabidopsis genomic BAC clone T14N5 (acc.no.

Both the right and the left junction between the ASHH2 gene and the insertions were cloned and sequenced for all alleles except ashh2-5 which is likely to have a complex insertion. Genomic deletions of 33 and 8 bp where found at the insertion sites of ashh2-2 and ashh2-1, respectively. The lower panel shows the ASHH2 protein and the positions of known domains.

(L) ashh2-1 flower with carpeloid sepals (cs) and stamenoid petals (sp). (M) SEM of stamenoid petal of ashh2-1 flower.. . . . Inflorescences with flowers exhibiting homeotic transformations were consistently observed in all alleles inspected, including the efs1-1 allele in Ler background (Table S1). The transformed flowers mainly displayed sepals and carpeloid organs (Figure 1K) or carpeloid sepals and stamen-like petals (Figures 1L and 1M). Homeotic changes with sepal and petal organs only, were never encountered (n=83, Table S1).. . . ashh2 transmission is affected through both male and female gametes. Mutant plants of all alleles had short siliques. In ashh2-1 siliques the ovule number was reduced by 80% compared to wt (Figure 2A), and less than a quarter of the ovules developed into mature seeds (Figures 2B and 2D). Reduced seed setting was also observed after hand self-pollination of the mutant. In situ hybridization demonstrated expression of ASHH2 in the endosperm as well as in the developing embryo (Figure 2C). If the reduced seed set was due to developmental defects in homozygous ashh2 fertilization products, one would have expected 25% aborted seeds when self-fertilizing heterozygous plants. However, ASHH2 appears to be redundant both for embryo and endosperm development as no deviation from wt in number of ovules/seeds or phenotype could be observed during embryogenesis in siliques of selfed heterozygous ASHH2/ashh2-1 plants (Figure 2B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0007817.g002.

Strong expression is found in maternal chalazal proliferating tissue (cz). Weaker expression was observed in the nucellus and inner (ii) and outer integuments (oi). (G) pASHH2:GUS expression in maternal tissue strongly in the chalazal tissues (cz) and weaker in the inner integuments (ii) and even weaken in the outer integument (oi) after fertilization. The chalazal region (cz) is indicated by an arrow and pollen tubes (pt) that have grown along the funiculus (f) with thin lines. The septum (s) with its transmitting tract (tt) is indicated.. . . . If the reduced seed set was due to a defect in ashh2 haploid gametophytes, one would expect reduced transmission of the mutant allele. Therefore we genotyped the progeny resulting from self-fertilization of heterozygous plants. Self-fertilization of ASHH2/ashh2-1 plants resulted in only 8% homozygous ashh2-1/ashh2-1 mutant progeny and 37% wt plants, instead of the expected 25% (n=62, Table 2). A similar frequency of homozygous plants resulted from selfing of heterozygous ASHH2/ashh2-2, ASHH2/ashh2-5 and ASHH2/ashh2-6 plants (10.7%, n=140; 8.5%, n=71; 17%, n=94, respectively). As no seed abortion could be observed, this suggested that male and/or female transmission was affected. This was tested with reciprocal crosses of ASHH2/ashh2-1 heterozygous plants with wt plants, which revealed that both female and male transmission was reduced from the expected 50% to 39% and 37%, respectively (Table 2). The transmission efficiency (Table 2) for the male and female mutant alleles would result in an expected frequency of ashh2 homozygous progeny of 9%, i.e. close to the observed 8%. The expected number of male and female gametophytes in ASHH2/ashh2 plants defective in transmission of mutant gametes would be about 20% (Table 2) [15]. Since no obvious defects in pollen or embryo sac development could be observed in heterozygous lines, this suggests a role for ASHH2 in gametophyte function, e.g. pollen tube growth or attraction.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0007817.t002.

The frequency of affected female or male gametophytes alone could not account for the severe reduction in seed set observed in homozygous ashh2 plants (Figures 2A, 2B and 2D). Thus this suggests that the main requirement of ASHH2 is in the sporophyte for proper development or function of ovules and anthers.. . . ashh2 mutants are defective in ovule and embryo sac development. In wt plants, one megaspore resulting from meiosis of the megaspore mother cell (MMC) develops into the embryo sac comprised of the egg cell, two synergid cells, three antipodal cells, and a dihaploid central cell (Figure 3A). Inner- and outer integuments elongate in the proximal-distal axis and encase the nucellar tissue.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0007817.g003. Figure 3. . Ovule and embryo sac development in wt and ashh2-1.. Differential interference contrast (DIC) micrographs of (A) wt and (B-L) ashh2-1 ovules at one day post anthesis (A-C), anthesis (D-F), day before anthesis (G-I) and at the time point of the first syncytial nuclear division (J-L). Scale bar, 25 m. (A) Wt mature ovule harboring embryo sac with (arrows) egg cell (ec), central cell (cc) and synergid cells (syn, only one synergid cell is in the focal plane). The embryo sac is surrounded by maternal chalazal (cz) tissue and endothelium layer (et), and further surrounded by two more layers of inner integuments (ii) and two layers of outer integuments (oi). Arrowheads mark the border between the embryo sac and the adaxial (adx) endothelium and the abaxial (abx) chalazal tissue. (B) ashh2-1 ovule without embryo sac between endothelium and the adaxial chalazal tissue (arrowheads). Ovule morphology appears fairly normal with two outer integument layers (oi) and three inner integuments (ii and et). The chalazal tissue in the center of the ovule appears to have proliferated more than in wt. (C) ashh2-1 ovule from same silique as (B) with a single mono-nucleate cell (boxed).

Inset in the upper right corner shows magnification of boxed area (n, nucleus). Two nuclei are not in the focal plane. (E) Proliferated ashh2-1 syncytial embryo sac. Inset in the upper right corner is a merge of two focal planes and shows magnification of the boxed area (n, nucleus). The basally located nuclei appear to degenerate. Note that the micropylar end of the embryo sac is not covered by integuments in both (E) and (F). (F) ashh2-1 embryo sac. Inset in the upper right corner shows magnification of the boxed area show two nuclear structures reminiscent of egg and central cell nuclei (n, nucleus). (G-H) ashh2-1 ovules with embryo sac-like structure (arrow) budding off the micropylar end of the ovule. The integuments do not encase the structure. (I) ashh2-1 ovule arrested or delayed in development. The inner integuments have developed longer than the outer integuments. (J-L) ashh2-1 ovules with two nucleate syncytial embryo sacs. No vacuole could be observed between the nuclei (n, nucleus).. . . . One day post anthesis (flower stage 12) when wt ovules harbor a mature embryo sac (Figure 3A), no apparent embryo sac, or in a few cases an embryo sac consisting of a single-nucleated cell, was found in mutant ovules (Figures 3B and 3C; 79%, n=141). The overall ovule and integument morphology was close to wt in this class, however, an overproliferation of the abaxial chalazal part of the ovule was often observed (Figure 3B). In slightly earlier stages, a small fraction of ovules could be found where up to three rounds of nuclear proliferation had occurred in the embryo sac (Figures 3D to 3F; 9%, n=141, in corresponding wt stages 95%, n=111). In most cases, these syncytial embryo sacs were not encased completely by the outer integuments (Figures 3E and 3F). The observed proliferating nuclei were in most cases undifferentiated (Figure 3D) or appeared to start to degenerate (Figure 3E), but nuclear structures reminiscent of egg and central cell nuclei were also observed (Figure 3F). In some cases (10%, n=141) the embryo sac-like structure was not surrounded by the integuments and protruded out of the micropyle as a bag of nuclei (Figures 3G and 3H). The nuclei in some cases appeared degenerated (Figure 3G) or were of different sizes (Figure 3H). In ovules that aborted in early stages both outer and inner integument elongation appeared to be delayed (Figure 3I).. In order to investigate whether embryo sacs develop and thereafter are expelled from the ovule, thus resulting in an apparent lack of the female gametophyte, or if most embryo sacs abort and degenerate at early stages of development, we analyzed young stages of embryo sac development. We found that the majority of the embryo sacs inspected (66%, n=62) were degenerated and no clear nuclear morphology could be seen. In 18% of the embryo sacs a prominent single nuclei could be found (similar to Figure 3C, n=62). However, 16% of the embryo sacs had completed the first nuclear division and harbored two syncytial nuclei (Figure 3J-L, n=62). Our findings thus favor a scenario where most ashh2 embryo sacs arrest and degenerate slightly after or before the first syncytial division. The number of embryo sacs that have made the first nuclear division is in good accordance with the number of protruding embryo sacs found at later stages, suggesting that if the first division is made further divisions can follow, but that most of these syncytial embryo sacs will be expelled, resulting in an apparent lack of the female gametophyte.. Taken together the observed defect in ashh2 ovules appears to be a failure to progress into female gametophyte or embryo sac development after meiosis. Based on the genetics of the mutant lines, a sporophytic requirement of ASHH2 is suggested and thus the primary defect may relay on a failure in meiosis or MMC initiation. In support of this hypothesis, a construct with the ASHH2 promoter coupled to the GUS reporter gene, was expressed in the subepidermal L2 cell layer of the nucellus at the position of MMC initiation (Figure 2E) [16]. The observed phenotype could alternatively be effected by missing support from the maternal ovule integuments. However, during later stages of the mature embryo sac, pASHH2:GUS expression was most prominent in maternal chalazal proliferating tissue and only weakly expressed in the integuments (Figures 2F to 2G).. . . ashh2 plants have reduced numbers of pollen. Due to the low expected frequency of affected pollen grains in heterozygous plants (Table 2) male semi-sterility was studied in homozygous mutants. All mutant alleles had reduced amounts of pollen (Figure 4A); anthers displayed a large variation in the number of pollen in each pollen sac (locule) with frequent empty or undeveloped locules (Figure 4B, Figure S2), e.g. 1.6 locules were seen per ashh2-1 anther (total 49 locules in 31 anthers). This suggests that the early stages of archesporial division have been affected, resulting in an absence of the parental cell layers generating the sporocytes.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0007817.g004.

(H) Scanning electron micrographs of wt pollen (i) with a sexine layer (ii) with regular ridges (muri - m) and spaces (lumina - l). (I) Scanning electron micrographs of ashh2-1 pollen grains (i, ii) and exine layers with filled muris (iii), and in severe cases visible nexine layer (n) and bacula (b) due to absent tectum layer (iv).. . . . As the reduced number of pollen grains in ashh2 could also be due to defects in male meiosis, we inspected meiosis in ashh2-1, ashh2-2 and ashh2-5 lines using a whole-mount DAPI/Aniline Blue staining procedure. Tetrad number from each anther was very variable and generally lower in the mutant, however, examination of stages from the initial division of the pollen mother cells (PMC) up to early progamic development post meiosis did not reveal any apparent deviation from wt (Figure S3A). DAPI stained one-nucleated microspores were released from the tetrads (Figures S3A and S3B), but a variable number did not stain or hydrate in DAPI solution, indicating degeneration. After the first mitosis, some DAPI-stained microspores deviated slightly from wt in that generative nuclei appeared less compact and occasionally with two instead of one nucleolus (Figure S3C). At the trinucleate stage typically 25% of the pollen were DAPI stained (n=65) compared to >99% in wt (n=1290) (Figure S3D; viability was confirmed by Alexander staining.). Especially in older flowers, dehiscence appeared to be delayed (Figure 4Bi). However, a low frequency of dehiscence occurred (Figure 4Bii and Figure S2A), releasing trinucleate pollen that could produce a pollen tube and appeared to be fully functional (Figure 4Biii).. . . pASHH2:GUS is expressed in the tapetum layer and in post-meiotic pollen. pASHH2:GUS plants were used to correlate the defects in anther and pollen development to ASHH2 expression patterns. No GUS expression was detected in the developing floral organ primordia or in pollen tetrads (Figure 4C and Figure 4D, insert). During early post-meiosis (floral stage 9) a weak signal could be detected in floral organs that persisted and increased in intensity at later stages (Figure 4D and 4E). Expression was found in anthers, as well as the gyneocium and mid veins of petals and sepals (Figure 4E). At stage 12, however, pASHH2:GUS was strongly expressed specifically in the maternal sporophytic tapetum layer accompanied by a less intense expression in the microspores (Figures 4F and 4G).. . . Exine deposition is affected in ashh2 pollen. As the tapetum layer contributes to pollen-wall synthesis and sporopollenin deposition, ashh2 pollen grains were inspected for changes in the exine layer using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figures 4H and 4I). Wt pollen grains have an oval shape with two parallel furrows (Figure 4Hi) and an outer ordered exine lattice mainly composed of polymerized sporopollenin (Figure 4Hii). All four ashh2 alleles had abnormal pollen grains with overall irregular shape and an exine pattern deviating from the even reticulation of the wt (Figures 4I, Figure S4 and Table S3). The ridges (muri) were often flattened and more irregular with smaller spaces (lumina) that in some cases seem to be filled with material (Figures 4Iiii), and the reticulate tectum was in many cases incomplete or even totally absent giving the exine layer a spotted appearance (Figure 4Iiv and Figure S4).. . . Tapetal development is distorted in ashh2 mutant plants. Mutant anther development was studied in more detail using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as many ashh2 anthers showed locules with a number of aberrations (Figure S2). During Early Ring Stage in the wt (Figure 5A) the microspores are free and the tapetum is actively synthesizing wall materials. In locules of ashh2-1 and ashh2-2 anthers, abnormal tapetal enlargement could be found at the corresponding stage (Figures 5D, 5G and 5J). During Pollen Mitosis I (PMI) to PMII (Figure 5B) active secretion of wall material occurs by the wt tapetum to form the exine layer, and the tapetal membrane degenerates. In the corresponding stage in ashh2-1 (Figure 5E), globular material accumulated in membrane-bound vesicles (arrow in 5E) that fused to form the major components of the tapetum (Figure 5F). In the ashh2-2 allele abnormal accumulation and deposition of pollen wall material were evident (Figures 5G and 5J and arrow in Figures 5H and 5K) leading to agglutination of the immature pollen grains. Immediately prior to dehiscence in the wt, the tapetum has fully degraded and the pollen coat has been deposited (Figure 5C). In contrast, the mutant tapetum and also the tapetal membrane persisted longer (Figure 5F and arrowhead in Figure 5E). In some cases severe deficiencies in the exine sculpturing and abnormal pollen wall development were observed (Figures 5I and 5L), consistent with the results from the SEM analysis (Figures 4I and Figure S4). Contrary to the distorted tapetum development, secondary thickening of the endothecium, degeneration of the middle cell layer, as well as stomium breakdown appeared normal in the mutant (Figure 5).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0007817.g005. Figure 5. . TEM analysis of tapetal and pollen development in ashh2 and wt.. (A) Early Ring Stage with free microspores (M) in wt.

Note that normal tapetal degeneration fails to occur and that the tapetal membrane is clearly visible (arrowhead). (F) Prior to dehiscence in the ashh2-1 mutant, normal endothecium secondary thickening (st) and thinning of the stomium (S) is seen. However the tapetal cells (T) are still present and release of the globular material previously visible (Figure 6E) has not occurred, suggesting that tapetal development is impaired and delayed. (G and J) Pollen Mitosis I to Pollen Mitosis II in the ashh2-2 mutant, note secondary thickening (st) of the endothecium and that degeneration of the middle cell layer has occurred. Exine formation (ex) with well-defined bacula is visible, however, the tapetum (T) appears enlarged with an abnormal accumulation of wall materials. (H and K) As pollen mitosis progresses in ashh2-2 abnormal deposition of pollen wall material is evident (arrow), resulting in agglutination of the immature pollen grains. In some cases a deficiency of the exine sculpturing is observed (arrowheads). (I and L) Prior to dehiscence in ashh2-2 normal breakdown of the stomium occurs, however abnormal pollen wall development is observed (arrow), resulting in some cases in extreme malformation of the pollen wall (L).

Total RNA from wt and ashh2-1 young flowers and buds was used in a microarray experiment encompassing oligonucleotides representing 27 000 unique genes aimed at identifying target genes for ASHH2 (see Materials and Methods) (Figure 6A). When controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) [17] in the statistical analysis at a 0.01 level, and using an absolute log2-ratio >0.7 as cut-off (i.e. up- or down-regulation 1.6 times), 348 genes were up-regulated and 637 down-regulated in ashh2-1 compared to wt.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0007817.g006.

IN - input; -ab - without antibodies.. . . . These gene sets were analyzed with the TAIR GO annotation tool (http://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp). A higher proportion of the upregulated genes were related to biotic or abiotic stimulus or stress processes (11%) than the down-regulated genes (5%) (Figure 6A and Table S2), and only one of the up-regulated genes, MATERNAL EFFECT EMBRYO ARREST 38 (MEE 38), is known to be involved in reproductive processes [18]. In contrast, a number of the down-regulated genes are known to be involved in such processes (Table 3), e.g. ATDMC1 needed for meiosis [19]; ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) and MALE STERILE 2 (MS2), involved in tapetum function and anther dehiscence [20], [21].. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0007817.t003.

Expression patterns have roughly been grouped by using AtGenexpress (AtGE Development). n.a. - gene not on Affimetrix micro arrays. n.t. - expression shows little tissues-specificity.. . . . Twenty-three and 35 genes, respectively, encoding putative transcription factors (TFs) were up- and down-regulated (Figure 6A), however, several of these have undefined functions (Table 3). The most strongly down-regulated gene was the FLC-related MADS-BOX AFFECTING FLOWERING 1 (MAF1), which has been reported down-regulated in ashh2 seedlings [6], [7], [14], [22]. Likewise the highly similar and clustered genes MAF2-MAF5 [14], [22] were all down-regulated in the inflorescence sample (Table 3).. . . A number of genes are co-down-regulated in ashh2 and ms1 and/or spl/ems1 mutants. A network of genes controls anther development and function, including SPOROCYTELESS (SPL) which act very early in anther development, EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES 1 (EMS1) involved in early tapetal initiation, and MALE STERILE 1 (MS1) needed for tapetal development and function. As the ashh2 mutants have a clear defect in pollen production we compared ashh2 mutant microarray data with array data for spl, ems1 and ms1 mutants [23], [24]. The expression levels of these genes themselves were not significantly altered in the ashh2 background, indicating that ASHH2 is not acting upstream of these genes, or acts in independent pathways. Only one gene was up-regulated in both the ashh2 and ms1 microarrays and only ten genes were co-upregulated in the ashh2 and spl/ems1 microarrays. In contrast, a significant number of genes showed coordinate down-regulation, suggesting downstream involvement in common pathways. Out of 1030 genes down-regulated in both spl and ems1, 144 (log2>0.7) were also down-regulated in ashh2 (Figure 6B). Of the 240 genes down-regulated more than two fold in ms1 [24], 46.3% (111 genes) were also down-regulated in ashh2 mutant inflorescences (Table S4). These encompass tapetum-specific genes encoding oleosins and lipases that together make up 90% of the detectable pollen coat protein [25], as well as the genes encoding the transcription factors MYB99, AtNAC25 and AtNAC5 suggested to be direct targets of MS1 [24], [26].. . . Genes associated with the ashh2 phenotype show a reduction in gene expression and H3K36 trimethylation. Genes that were down-regulated in the microarray experiment and potentially involved in different aspects of the ashh2 mutant phenotype showed consistent expression changes by real-time PCR (Figure 6C, Table 3). The expression levels of the AP1 and AP3 genes, encoding A and B floral organ identity factors, respectively, and the QRT3 and AtDMC1 genes, were reduced by 40 to 50%. MEE48 and UNE15 involved in female gametophyte development and function, as well as the tapetal TFs MYB99, AtNAC5 and AtNAC25 were down-regulated 60 to 70%.. Based on the ASHH2 protein's similarity to other ASH1-like proteins working as transcriptional co-activators [27] (Figure S5) and ChIP data from ashh2 non-reproductive tissue [6], [7], [12], [13], we expected genes that are potential direct target of ASHH2 to be down-regulated and to have changes in the level of histone H3 methylation at K4 and/or K36 in ashh2. Chromatin was isolated from inflorescences of young wt and ashh2-1 mutant plants, and precipitated using antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K36me2 and H3K36me3. Two to three biological replicas were used for each precipitation, and genes representing different aspects of the mutant phenotype (AP1 - floral organ identify; AtDMC1 - embryo sac development; MYB99 - pollen development, Figure 6D) were selected for ChIP analysis. In all cases no changes were seen for H3K4me3 or H3K36me2 (Figure 6E and Figure S6). In contrast, substantial reduction of H3K36me3 was revealed (Figure 6E and Figure S6) both relative to the input and the Ta3 retrotransposon used as a control [7], [28]. This suggests that ASHH2 regulates expression of these genes via H3K36 trimethylation..
PMC5156734	Results. . Melatonin Suppressed the Primary Root Growth in Arabidopsis by Reduced Root Meristem. To investigate the effects of melatonin on primary root growth in Arabidopsis, 3-day-old WT (Col-0) seedlings were transferred to new 1/2 MS media with different concentrations of melatonin for another 6 days (Figure 1). By measuring and statistical analysis, we found that the primary root length was decreased after melatonin treatment, and the inhibition effect of melatonin exhibited dose-dependent (Figure 1). The result suggested that high concentration of melatonin could suppress the primary root growth in Arabidopsis.. . FIGURE 1. . Effect of high concentration of Melatonin on the length of Arabidopsis primary root. After 3 days culture, seedlings were transferred to 1/2 MS medium with indicated concentrations of melatonin for other 6 days, and the primary root length were measured with software Image J. (A) Digital images of wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings treated with different concentrations of melatonin. Scale bar = 1 cm. (B) Primary root length of Arabidopsis growing on medium with control and increasing concentration of melatonin. More than 25 seedlings per experiment from three independent experiments were measured for statistic analysis. Values represent mean  SD, P < 0.01 by a Students t-test.. . . . In plants, postembryonic root growth is sustained by the root apical meristem (RAM), which consists of stem cell-like cells that are the precursors of all differentiated cell types (Laux and Mayer, 1998; Dinneny and Benfey, 2008). So we wonder if melatonin to reduce the primary root length by affecting root meristem. To test our hypothesis, 3-day-old seedlings were kept growing under different concentrations of melatonin for another 6 days, and we found that both the number of meristem cells and the length of meristem are significantly reduced with increased concentration of melatonin (Figures 2B,C), indicating that melatonin-mediated repression of primary root growth might be due to reduced root meristem.. . FIGURE 2. . Effects of Melatonin on the size of the Arabidopsis root meristem. Three-day-old seedlings were kept growing under different concentrations of melatonin for other 6 days. More than 25 seedlings per experiment from three independent experiments were cleared for imaging. Values represent mean  SD, P < 0.01 by a Students t-test.

More than 25 seedlings per experiment from three independent experiments were measured for statistic analysis. Values represent mean  SD, P < 0.01 by a Students t-test.. . . . Our data showed that 10 muM melatonin had no effect on primary root growth (Figures 1 and 2), and our previous work suggested that 10-50 muM melatonin had litter effect on endogenous melatonin content (Shi et al., 2015c). Therefore, we chose high concentration of melatonin for further analyses in this study.. . . Melatonin Negatively Regulated Auxin Biosynthesis. Since defective auxin response can cause reduced meristem phenotype, the first question we wanted to known was whether melatonin actually affects auxin biosynthesis. YUCCA (YUC) proteins, TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS (TAA) family, TAA RELATED 1 and 2 play important roles in auxin (IAA) biosynthesis during plant development (Cheng et al., 2006; Yamamoto et al., 2007; Stepanova et al., 2008; Tao et al., 2008), so we investigated the effects of melatonin on the transcript levels of these genes (Figure 3A). Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the transcript levels of YUC1, YUC2, YUC5, YUC6, and TAR2 significantly decreased after 600 muM melatonin treatment. The transcript levels of YUC3, YUC4, YUC7, and YUC8 increased after treatment, while the relative expression levels of YUC3 and YUC8 in roots with treatment were less than 1.5-fold in control. Indeed, the endogenous IAA content in melatonin-treated roots was significantly lower than that of control (Figure 3B).. . FIGURE 3. . The effects of melatonin on auxin synthesis and IAA content in Arabidopsis roots. (A) qRT-PCR analysis of auxin synthesis related genes expression under control and 600 muM melatonin treatment. Relative fold changes of the expression of YUC1, YUC2, YUC3, YUC4, YUC5, YUC6, YUC7, YUC8, TAA1, TAR1, and TAR2 were quantified by real-time PCR, and the expression levels of the indicated genes in control roots were set to 1. Values represent mean  SD, P < 0.05, and P < 0.01 by a Students t-test. (B) IAA contents in the roots of seedlings grown on control medium or medium supplemented with 600 muM melatonin. Values represent mean  SD, and P < 0.01 indicate significant differences by a Students t-test.. . . . . . Melatonin Repressed Polar Auxin Transport in Arabidopsis. PINFORMED proteins, especially PIN1, PIN3, and PIN7, directly participate in auxin transport in plant roots (Friml et al., 2003; Blilou et al., 2005), and play important roles in controlling the size of root meristem. In order to examine whether melatonin treatment affected the levels of these proteins in root, we measured the relative fluorescence intensity of GFP using the marker lines PIN1::PIN1-GFP, PIN3::PIN3-GFP, and PIN7::PIN7-GFP. As shown in Figure 4, signals of PIN1 in provasculture, and signals of PIN3 and PIN7 deriving from both root cap and provasculture region were decreased significantly after 600 muM treatment. The quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that the relative transcript levels of PIN1, PIN3, and PIN7 were also significantly reduced in melatonin-treated roots, suggesting that melatonin treatment repressed the expression of PIN1, PIN3 and PIN7. To further confirm the involvement of PINs in melatonin-mediated root development, the meristem length and cell number of the roots of PIN mutants (including pin1, pin3, pin7, pin3pin7, and pin1pin3pin7) were also determined. Notably, we found that the root growth of triple mutant pin1pin3pin7 was more tolerant to melatonin treatment than WT and other mutants (Figures 4D,E), indicating the essential role of PIN1/3/7 in melatonin-mediated repression of root meristem.. . FIGURE 4. . The expression of auxin eux components PINFORMEDS (PINs) were down-regulated after treatment of 600 muM melatonin.

Endogenous auxin level is directly related to development of plant roots. To further dissect the underlying mechanism of melatonin during Arabidopsis root growth and the relationship between melatonin and auxin, exogenous IAA and auxin transport inhibitor (TIBA) were used to treat the seedlings. Firstly, 3-day-old seedlings were treated with melatonin containing medium in the presence or absence of 2 muM TIBA for 8 days. The root meristem length and cell number were measured. The results showed that both melatonin and TIBA treated roots reduced root meristem length and cell number, but the inhibition caused by melatonin was not intensified by the presence of TIBA (Figures 5A,B), indicating that polar auxin transport (PAT) might be necessary for the regulation of root meristem size by melatonin treatment.. . FIGURE 5. . Melatonin has similar effect as auxin on Arabidopsis root tip growth. Three-day-old seedlings of wild-type (WT) and indicated markers were transferred to control medium or medium with various treatments. Values represent mean  SD, P < 0.05, and P < 0.01 by a Students t-test. (A) Root meristem length of WT seedlings treated without or with 600 muM melatonin in the presence or absence of 2 muM TIBA for 8 days.

(C) Root meristem length of WT seedlings treated without or with 600 muM melatonin in the presence or absence of 0.5 or 100 M IAA for 8 days. (D) Root meristem cell number of WT seedlings treated without or with 600 muM melatonin in the presence or absence of 0.5 or 100 nM IAA for 8 days. More than 25 seedlings per experiment from three independent experiments were measured for statistic analysis. Values represent mean  SD, different letters represent significant difference by a Students t-test. (E) Endogenous melatonin levels in the roots of seedlings grown on control medium or medium supplemented with 0.5 nM IAA. (F) Effect of melatonin on auxin response in root tips of DR5::GUS marker line seedlings. Scale bar = 50 mum. (G) Effect of melatonin, TIBA and IAA on auxin response in root tips of DR5::GFP marker line seedlings. Scale bar = 30 mum.. . . . Since melatonin-treated roots had lower IAA levels (Figure 3B), we wonder whether the root meristem size was reduced by melatonin through decreasing IAA content. If so, the reduction of root meristem size could be complemented, or partially complemented by exogenous IAA at a certain concentration. Two concentrations of IAA (0.5 and 100 nM) were used to treat the seedlings. We found that treatment of 0.5 nM IAA for 8 days alone did not affect the root meristem size, but 0.5 nM IAA and 600 muM melatonin co-treatment significantly reduced the root meristem size, similar to melatonin-treated roots alone (Figures 5C,D). Application of 100 nM IAA caused reduced root meristem size, as previous reported (Rahman et al., 2007; Strader et al., 2011), but the inhibition of 100 nM was less severe than that of 600 muM melatonin. To our surprise, 100 nM IAA and 600 muM melatonin co-treatment led to a more serious decrease in root meristem size than that of 600 muM melatonin (Figures 5C,D). In the meanwhile, we examined the content of endogenous melatonin in the roots of control and 0.5 nM IAA treated seedlings, and found that 0.5 nM IAA treatment resulted in increased level of melatonin (Figure 5E).. DR5 promoter contains seven tandem repeat sequences of an auxin-responsive element, and it is widely used as a reporter for auxin signaling responses and auxin distribution in Arabidopsis (Ulmasov et al., 1997; Friml et al., 2003). After GUS staining, we found that the distribution of auxin was dramatically changed upon melatonin treatment, as it diffused into lateral root cap (LRC) cells from columella cells (Figure 5F). Similar results could be obtained by the observation of DR5::GFP line seedlings treated with melatonin for 5 days (Figure 5G) while 2 muM TIBA changed the expression pattern of DR5::GFP in root tips. In combination with melatonin, TIBA-induced auxin signals spread to LRC cells and adjacent meristem cells further (Figure 5G). Exogenous application of 100 nM IAA, but not that of 0.5 nM IAA, caused expansion of auxin signals to the lower part of LRC cells, similar to that of melatonin treatment. Interestingly, in association with melatonin, IAA-induced fluorescence signals spread to the whole distal tips of the roots below QC (Figure 5G), just like seedlings treated with higher concentrations of IAA as reported before (Ottenschlger et al., 2003), suggesting that melatonin aggravated the accumulation of auxin signals in the whole distal tips of roots, in an IAA similar manner..
PMC3108824	Results. . Gene expression differences in the ddm1 mutant and in response to chemical treatment. Reduction of DNA methylation in the samples was assessed by comparative chromatin immunoprecipitation of control and 5-AC-treated DNA with an anti-5-methylcytosine antibody, and by sequencing bisulfite-treated genomic DNA for control, 5-AC-treated, and ddm1 seedlings. Bisulfite sequencing revealed an 80% reduction in asymmetric cytosine methylation after 5-AC treatment, and complete loss of asymmetric cytosine methylation in ddm1 for a methylated region of the CLAVATA2 gene examined. CNG methylation was completely lost after 5-AC treatment (Figure S1A). CG methylation was lost at 60% of CG sites in ddm1. A reduction in CG methylation was observed for 5-AC treatment on a per-sample basis, six CG sites in the sequenced region are methylated in 90-100% of control samples, these were found to be no more than 80% methylated after 5-AC treatment and no more than 30% methylated at any CG site in the ddm1 plants. This is consistent with the method of induction of loss of methylation in the treated and mutant samples. The ddm1 mutants have lost methylation over generations, while the chemical treatment results in loss of methylation in a subset of actively dividing cells. Additionally, efficiency of precipitation of methylated centromeric repeats was reduced by more than 50% after 5-AC treatment (Figure S1B). Together, these data suggest that methylation is reduced in the 5-AC-treated and ddm1 samples with respect to the control.. Complete lists of genes showing differential expression in this study are provided in Tables S1, S2, S3. Table S1 lists 35 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in the ddm1 mutant. While many genes on the array had high fold-change values, variation was also high (Figure S2); therefore a stringent false-discovery corrected cutoff was imposed to arrive at this list of genes specifically and reproducibly affected in the ddm1 mutant (see Materials and Methods). These genes are upregulated up to 100-fold. Twenty-five of the ddm1-regulated genes were also found to be significantly up-regulated after 5-AC treatment (Table S2), but the remaining 10 genes were up-regulated less than 3-fold after 5-AC treatment. Tables S2 and S3 list the genes found to be over- and under-expressed after 5-AC treatment, respectively. These genes span all functional categories.. . . Loss of DDM1 selectively affects transcription of transposable elements. Since it is known that both DNA methylation and DDM1 are involved in silencing transposable elements and pseudogenes, we examined the responses of these two classes of genes. Figure 1 shows the fold induction in response to 5-AC treatment or in the ddm1 mutant for all of the genes (240) annotated by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI, see Methods) as transposable elements and called present in this study by the MAS Version 5.0 software (Affymetrix). In both ddm1 mutants and 5-AC treated seedlings, many transposable elements were upregulated by 100-fold or more. The Affymetrix ATH1 microarray contains probes for 113 genes that are annotated as pseudogenes. Of the 33 probes called present in this experiment annotated as pseudogenes, only two of these genes change significantly in expression in either the ddm1 mutant or as a result of treatment with 5-AC (not shown). This is consistent with the role for cytosine methylation and DDM1 in specifically maintaining transcriptional silencing of transposable elements, and indicates that other factors may contribute to the maintenance of transcriptional silencing for pseudogene sequences.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0020587.g001. Figure 1. . Transposable element genes are upregulated in the ddm1 mutant and after 5-AC treatment.. Log expression differences (5-AC/Ws or ddm1/Ws) for 240 probesets annotated as transposable elements that were present on the microarray.. . . . To determine if gene expression changes resulting from changes in DNA methylation and chromatin structure were randomly distributed throughout the genome, average expression change for all the genes called present on the array was plotted against the chromosomal position of the genes obtained from AGI annotations. Figure 2 shows that genes up- or down-regulated after 5-AC treatment appear to be distributed evenly throughout the genome, and change in expression by up to 100-fold. In contrast, in the ddm1 mutant, relatively few genes changed dramatically in expression. The genes for which expression was altered were almost all up regulated, and these genes were located primarily in centromeric and pericentromeric regions. We also examined expression changes for genes encoded by subcellular organelle genomes (mitochondrion and chloroplast). We found that genes in the chloroplast were reduced in expression after 5-AC treatment (Figure 2B). Expression of genes in the mitochondrial genome (although there were fewer mitochondrial genes than chloroplast genes on the array) did not change significantly in response to 5-AC treatment, and the magnitude of change in expression levels of both plastid and mitochondrial genes was small in the ddm1 mutant, as is expected from the nuclear localization of DDM1 and its role in nuclear chromatin remodeling.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0020587.g002. Figure 2. . Genes misregulated in ddm1 are not evenly distributed in the Arabidopsis genome.. A. log10 fold-difference values (5-AC/Ws) and (ddm1/Ws) are plotted by transcription start site for 5 Arabidopsis chromosomes. B. log10 fold-difference values for 5-AC treated and ddm1 seedlings for chloroplast and mitochondrial genes.. . . . We compared the genes identified as significantly differentially regulated in this study with genes identified in previously published studies which also examined the effects of chemically disrupted chromatin structure on gene expression in Arabidopsis [25]. We found that 24 of the 73 genes identified in a previous study which examined the effects of 5-AC on gene expression were upregulated in the present study, and 18 of the 52 genes previously identified as down-regulated by 5-AC were consistently downregulated in our experimental conditions [22]. Genes that were common to both experiments are listed in Table S4. The relatively small overlap in these two experiments may be explained by the use of different microarray platforms covering distinct sets of transcripts, as well as different experimental conditions. The Affymetrix 22K platform includes a number of genes that are not included on other microarrays, in particular genes located near the centromere and probes for transposable element genes. It is also likely that epigenetic changes induced by these chemical treatments are likely to vary significantly from cell to cell within an individual as well as between experiments.. . . DNA damage response genes are upregulated in response to 5-AC treatment. We observed that a number of the genes moderately but significantly upregulated in 5-AC treated seedlings, such as the DMC1 and AtBRCA1 genes had putative or documented roles in DNA repair. We found that these genes were also induced by bleomycin and mitomycin treatment as profiled in AtGenExpress genotoxic stress timecourse dataset (ExpressionSet_ME000326, http://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=expression_set&id=1007966782) (Figure S4). These genes were not differentially regulated in the ddm1 mutant, and this suggests that 5-AC treatment may either result in increased DNA damage or double stranded breaks and that this DNA damage results from an aspect of chromatin remodeling not affected in the ddm1 mutant. This is consistent with findings in other systems regarding the effects of 5-AC treatment [19], [23]. Several genes involved in DNA-damage repair were chosen for validation by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (Figure 3). In contrast to other genes with a role in DNA repair, several genes for DNA base excision repair, including REPRESSOR OF SILENCING1 (ROS1) and DEMETER-LIKE3 (DML3), were significantly down-regulated in response to 5-AC treatment as well as in the ddm1 mutant. ROS1 and DML3 encode DNA glycosylases that have been shown to be involved in active de-methylation of targets by base excision repair [24], [25], [26], this may indicate that these genes are negatively regulated by genomic hypomethylation or other effects of 5-AC treatment.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0020587.g003.

Correlation with the other Arabidopsis chromatin mutants. The homology dependent gene silencing1 (hog1) mutant is deficient in the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase gene and shows reduced DNA methylation and upregulation of transposable element genes in genome wide expression profiling [27]. We compared expression of genes upregulated by ddm1 in this experiment to the top 200 overexpressed genes in the hog1 mutant (which used the same array as this study [28]) and observed that 26 of the ddm1 overexpressed genes from our experiment were represented in the 200 most-overexpressed genes from the hog1 mutant, and 83 of the genes significantly expressed after 5-AC treatment were also overexpressed in hog1. An independent study profiled gene expression in another ddm1 allele and the mom1 mutant [29]. Only 10 of the 35 genes upregulated in mom1 and ddm1 were found to be upregulated after 5-AC treatment in the present study (Table S5). None of the ddm1-upregulated genes from this study were found to be co-regulated by ddm1 and mom1 in the previous study [29]. The array platform used for the ddm1 mom1 profiling did not contain probes to interrogate as many of the transposable element open reading frames as the microarray used in the present study, therefore an extensive direct comparison is not possible. The response of the ddm1-regulated genes from this experiment in these related studies is shown graphically in Figure S5.. The role of methylation in control of gene expression on a global scale has previously been determined for the Arabidopsis met1 cytosine methyltransferase mutants lacking CG methylation, and the triple mutant drm1drm2cmt3 (ddc) which lacks CNN/CNG methylation [30]. We compared the genes significantly overexpressed in the met1 mutant identified in that study with the genes significantly up-regulated after treatment with 5-AC and in the ddm1 mutant. The majority (243) of the 319 MET1-regulated genes correspond to transcripts that are not present on the ATH1 array, located around the centromeres and pericentromeres. Of the 76 remaining genes, 13 were below the threshold of detection for our experiment, but 27 (35%) of these genes were found to be significantly up-regulated after 5-AC treatment, a fraction which is significantly higher than would be expected of two random gene sets of this size (Table S5). 14 of these 27 genes are annotated as transposable element-related sequences. 8 of the genes upregulated in met1 were found to be in the small and exclusive set of genes significantly upregulated in the ddm1 mutant. In contrast, the genes that are up-regulated in the drm1drm2cmt3 triple mutant (which are well-represented on the ATH1 microarray used in this study) are located in euchromatic regions, and only 15% are represented in the list of genes upregulated by 5-AC treatment. This fraction is close to what would be expected from comparing two random sets of genes this size (Table S5). None of these genes are significantly upregulated in the ddm1 mutant. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model where the ddm1 mutant is primarily affected in CG methylation, which is maintained by the MET1 methyltransferase and inhibited by 5-AC, and this form of cytosine methylation is necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional silencing of transposable elements located in centromeric and pericentromeric regions. CNG/CNN methylation requiring DRM1, DRM2 and CMT3, which is not inhibited by 5-AC, affects a different subset of genes located in euchromatin which have a variety of developmental functions, and their expression is largely unaffected by the ddm1 mutation (Figures S7 and S8) [30], [31]..
PMC3134337	Results. . Expression of the NPC gene family in response to salt. Arabidopsis plants were grown hydroponically for 5 weeks and afterwards were treated with Hoagland medium supplemented with 100mM NaCl for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 36h. Expression of all members of the NPC gene family was measured by quantitative RT-PCR in both roots and leaves of control non-treated plants and salt-treated plants. A slight increase in NPC6 gene expression in roots was observed after 6h of treatment (Fig. 1). Similarly, gene expression of NPC2 was slightly increased after 12h of salt treatment (data not shown). However, the most meaningful rise in gene expression was shown by NPC4. Quantification of expression of NPC5 was not possible because the transcript level in both non-treated and treated plants was too low in roots and leaves. This is consistent with published observations (Nakamura et al., 2005; Wimalasekera et al., 2010) where NPC5 transcript was found only in flowers.. . Fig. 1.. . Expression pattern of the NPC genes in NaCl-treated plants. The transcript levels of NPC genes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR in leaves and roots of non-treated plants and in plants treated with 100mM NaCl for 6h. Actin2 and UBQ10 were used as internal controls. The expression of each gene in non-treated controls was set to 1. Data represent the means SE, n=3 discrete samples from one biological experiment. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. NPC, non-specific phospholipase C; nd, not determined.. . . . In order to investigate the expression pattern of NPC4 further, Arabidopsis plants were also subjected to lower NaCl concentrations (25mM and 50mM) for identical amounts of time to those used in previous experiments. The results showed very distinct time and concentration dependence (Fig. 2). In both leaves and roots there was a transient increase in expression observed after 3-6h of treatment. Expression in roots was about twice as high as that in leaves. In roots treated with 25mM NaCl for 6h the expression of NPC4 was three times higher than NPC4 expression in control plants. Treatment with 50mM NaCl for 6h led to a 5-fold increase in the expression level of NPC4 in roots. Treatment with 100mM NaCl induced an increase in expression in roots as early as after 1h of the treatment, and the expression remained high for all sampled times. A rapid and transient increase of NPC4 expression may indicate a signalling function for NPC4.. . Fig. 2.. . Detailed analysis of NPC4 expression in NaCl-treated plants. The transcript levels of the NPC4 gene were measured by quantitative real-time PCR in leaves and roots of non-treated plants and in plants treated with different concentrations of NaCl (25-100mM) for different times (1-36h). Actin2 and UBQ10 were used as internal controls. The expression of NPC4 in non-treated controls at the respective times was set to 1. Data represent the means SE, n=2 discrete samples from one biological experiment. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results.. . . . . . Activity of NPC in salt-treated Arabidopsis seedlings. A method based on using fluorescently labelled PC (bodipy-PC) to determine the activity of NPC in tobacco cells was recently reported (Pejchar et al., 2010; Wimalasekera et al., 2010). A similar approach was employed to determine the activity of NPC in Arabidopsis seedlings. In order to find out if the observed increase in NPC4 expression is recognizable at the level of enzyme activity, 1-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings were labelled with bodipy-PC and then treated with different NaCl concentrations (10-100mM NaCl) for 90min. The quantity of bodipy-DAG, the product of NPC activity, doubled after 90min of 10mM NaCl treatment and increased 4-fold after 100mM NaCl treatment. (Fig. 3A). Arabidopsis seedlings were also treated with 100mM NaCl for different times (15, 30, 60, and 90min). Changes in NPC activity were already detectable after 30min of NaCl treatment. Thus, it is obvious that salt-stressed Arabidopsis seedlings respond by the rapid alteration of the NPC activity and that this effect is caused even by very mild salt stress (10mM NaCl). Rapid changes in expression of NPC4 in 7-day-old seedlings were also determined after 4h of 100mM salt treatment and 2.5-fold (0.3) increase found.. . Fig. 3.. . Effect of NaCl on DAG production in Arabidopsis seedlings. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on agar plates for 7d. Prior to treatment seedlings were removed from agar and incubated with bodipy-PC for 10min in water. (A) Seedlings were treated for 90min with 0-100mM NaCl. Lipids were extracted, separated by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HP-TLC) and quantified. The quantity of bodipy-DAG in control non-treated seedlings was set to 100%. Data represent means SE from independently analysed parallel samples. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. (B) Seedlings were treated with 100mM NaCl. Lipids were extracted at the time intervals indicated, separated by HP-TLC, and quantified. The quantity of bodipy-DAG in control non-treated seedlings was set to 100%. Data represent the means SE from independently analysed parallel samples. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results. DAG, diacylglycerol.. . . . . . Expression of NPC4 is localized in root tips. To gain insights into the localization of expression of NPC4 in roots after salt treatment, the expression pattern was investigated using promoter:GUS plants. Histochemical analysis of PNPC4:GUS plants confirmed that the expression pattern under salt stress was changed only in the roots (Fig. 4; data from other plant organs are not shown). In 10-day-old seedlings the expression was located predominantly in the root tips of the main and lateral roots of both control and treated plants (Fig. 4A). The highest intensity of GUS staining in control plants was found in the apical meristem and partly in the region of elongation, whereas after incubation in 100mM NaCl the staining had spread to the region of mature cells. The highest expression outside the root tips was observed in epidermal cells, vascular tissues, and lateral root primordium.. . Fig. 4.. . Histochemical analysis of PNPC4:GUS expression under salt stress in Arabidopsis plants. (A) Effect of salt on the PNPC4:GUS expression pattern in the main root of 10-day-old seedlings. The plants were grown on agar and transferred to liquid nutrient solution with or without 100mM NaCl for 24h. (B) Effect of salt on the PNPC4:GUS expression pattern in roots of 5-week-old Arabidopsis plants. The plants were grown hydroponically in modified half-strength Hoagland's solution and exposed to 100mM NaCl for 4h.. . . . Hydroponically grown 5-week-old plants were analysed to see if a similar expression pattern would occur in adult plants of the same age used to observed NPC expression measured by quantitative PCR. Despite the differences in the age of plants, the GUS expression pattern remained the same (Fig. 4B).. . . Sensitivity of NPC4 knockout Arabidopsis lines to salt. Two lines of homozygous Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants of NPC4 were used as described in Wimalasekera et al. (2010): npc4-1 (SALK_046713) and npc4-2 (GK_571E10) (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). There is no obvious phenotype of either of these lines when grown in normal conditions in soil either in the greenhouse or in the growth chamber.. However, when mutant plants were grown in Petri dishes on agar MS medium supplemented with MES, inositol, and sucrose (see Materials and methods), there were slight but not significant differences in npc4-1, npc4-2, and the WT in fresh weight and root length. At the same time, significant decreases (t-test P <0.05) in both fresh weight and root length were revealed under salt stress conditions (Fig. 5A-C). The fresh weight and main root length phenotype of npc4-2 was dose dependent. The fresh weight of npc4-2 seedlings was reduced by 20% at 50mM NaCl compared with the WT and by almost 25% at 100mM NaCl (Fig. 5B). Similarly the main root length of npc4-2 was reduced by 25% at 50mM NaCl compared with the WT and by 55% at 100mM NaCl compared with the WT (Fig. 5C). Even though the fresh weight and the main root length of npc4-1 were also reduced at 100mM compared with the WT (Fig. 5B, C), these reductions were not significant (t-test P <0.05).. . Fig. 5.. . Effect of NaCl on fresh weight and root length of npc4-1 and npc4-2 knockouts. (A) Arabidopsis thaliana Col wild-type (WT), npc4-1, and npc4-2 were grown on agar plates supplemented with 0, 50, and 100mM NaCl for 14d. (B) Fresh weight of 14-day-old WT, npc4-1, and npc4-2 seedlings. Forty-five seedlings from one agar plate were pooled and weighed. Data represent the means SE, n=4. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. (C) Root length of 14-day-old WT, npc4-1, and npc4-2 seedlings. Data represent the means SE, n=52. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant (t-test P <0.05) difference in comparison with the WT.. . . . It is well known that salt inhibits seed germination. Therefore, germination of npc4 seeds on control medium and on medium supplemented with 150mM NaCl was determined. Germination of seeds of both npc4 lines was indistinguishable from germination of WT seeds on control medium, and nearly 100% of WT and npc4 seeds germinated within 24h. However, on the medium with 150mM NaCl, 82% of WT seeds, 76% of npc4-1, and only 27% of npc4-2 seeds germinated after 24h. Still nearly all seeds of the WT and npc4 germinated within 42h. Thus it was shown that the germination rate of npc4 seeds decreased in comparison with WT seeds, but 150mM NaCl does not inhibit germination completely (Fig. 6).. . Fig. 6.. . Effect of NaCl on the seed germination phenotype of npc4-1 and npc4-2 knockouts. Forty-five seeds of the WT, npc4-1, or npc4-2 were germinated on an agar plate with or without 150mM NaCl. Germinated seeds were counted at 24, 30, 36, and 42h after transferring seeds from 4C. Data represent the means SE, n=4. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results.. . . . These results show a higher sensitivity of npc4 knockout lines to NaCl and demonstrate that NPC4 plays a role in response of Arabidopsis to salt stress.. . . Transcription pattern of salt and phospholipid signalling-related genes. The results mentioned above demonstrate that NPC4 is involved in the response of Arabidopsis plants to salt stress. Genes which are known to be related to salt stress as well as those related to phospholipid signalling were selected and their expression pattern was tested for alterations in npc4-1, npc4-2, and the WT under salt stress conditions. Expression of the genes was monitored in roots and leaves of 5-week-old hydroponically grown Arabidopsis plants treated with 100mM NaCl. Samples were taken 3, 6, 9, and 12h after addition of NaCl to the medium.. Differences between the gene expression pattern of salt-treated WT and knockout plants were found only in roots, and data from leaves are, therefore, not shown.. . Expression of salt overly sensitive (SOS) signal transduction pathway genes:. The SOS signalling pathway is probably the best characterized salt-specific signal transduction pathway (Zhu, 2002, 2003; Munns and Tester, 2008). The calcineurin B-like protein (CBL4/SOS3) interacts with CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK24/SOS2) (Gong et al., 2004) and the CBL4-CIPK24 complex then activates the Na+/H+ antiporter SOS1 located at the plasma membrane (Qiu et al., 2002). In roots of salt-treated WT plants, expression of all SOS genes doubled during 12h. Expression of both SOS2 and SOS3 genes preceded expression of the SOS1 gene. This increase was distinctly smaller in npc4 knockouts (Fig. 7). Such results might indicate a link between the SOS signalling pathway and NPC4.. . Fig. 7.. . Relative level of gene expression of SOS signal transduction genes in the WT, npc4-1, and npc4-2 under 100mM NaCl treatment. The transcript levels of SOS1, CIPK24/SOS2, and CBL4/SOS3 were measured by quantitative real-time PCR in roots of non-treated plants and in plants treated with 100mM NaCl for 3, 6, 9, and 12h. Actin2 and UBQ10 were used as internal controls. The expression of the genes in non-treated controls at the respective times was set to 1. Data represent the means SE, n=2 discrete samples from one biological experiment. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results.. . . . . . Expression of ion transporters:. During salt stress, Na+ ions enter mainly passively across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm of root cells. A low concentration of Na+ in the cytoplasm has to be maintained and, therefore, vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter (NHX) is activated during salt stress and Na+ is sequestered into vacuoles (Pardo et al., 2006; Munns and Tester, 2008). Expression of NHX1 and NHX8 was monitored. NHX1 is one of the predominant isoforms in Arabidopsis and is an important member of the salt tolerance machinery (Rodrguez-Rosales et al., 2009). NHX8 also belongs to the monovalent cation:proton antiporter-1 family; however, it is more specific as a plasma membrane Li+/H+ antiporter (An et al., 2007). No clear tendency in the NHX expression pattern in WT and npc4 plants under salt stress was observed (Supplementary Fig. S3A at JXB online).. . . Expression of phospholipid signalling-related genes:. The role of DAG, the product of PC-PLC activity, in plants is not very clear. DAG is likely to act as a signalling molecule at least in some systems such as tobacco pollen tubes (Helling et al., 2006). However, it is generally assumed that the most probable mechanism of DAG action is the conversion of DAG to PA by diacylglycerol kinase (DGK). It was shown that the PI-PLC/DGK pathway is activated during water stress. Therefore, expression of DGK1, the isoform which is induced by salt and drought according to the Genevestigator database (https://www.genevestigator.com) (Hruz et al., 2008), was monitored. PA is a well documented signalling molecule that is also involved in responses to salt stress. One of the genes which is known to be activated by PA is TOR (Fang et al., 2001). TOR is important in cell growth and development and also in hyperosmotic stress (Menand et al., 2002; Mahfouz et al., 2006). Thus, expression of TOR was monitored in WT and npc4 plants. Expression of DGK1 was somewhat higher after salt treatment at later times; however, there were not very clear differences between WT and npc plants. Expression of TOR in WT and knockouts remained unchanged after salt treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3B at JXB online).. . . Expression of ABA-related genes:. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a hormone whose concentration is elevated during salt stress, and ABA-related genes are induced afterwards (Knight et al., 1997; Kreps et al., 2002; Zhu, 2002; Christmann et al., 2006). Among them, expression of ABI1, ABI2, RAB18, PP2CA, SOT12, and TSPO was monitored. Additionally, expression of the stress-responsive gene RD29/LTI78/COR78 that is supposed to be functional in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signalling pathways was also monitored (Agarwal and Jha, 2010). Expression of ABI1, ABI2, PP2CA, and SOT12 in roots of salt-treated npc4-1 and npc4-2 plants clearly decreased in comparison with expression of these genes in salt-treated WT plants (Fig. 8). The decrease was detected at all monitored time points. However, the expression of RAB18 in npc4-1 and npc4-2 roots was decreased only at early time points (3h and 6h). The expression pattern of TSPO (Fig. 8) as well as of RD29/LTI78/COR78 (Supplementary Fig. S3C) did not differ distinctly in WT and npc4 plants.. . Fig. 8.. . Relative level of gene expression of ABA-related genes in the WT, npc4-1, and npc4-2 under 100mM NaCl treatment. The transcript levels of ABI1, ABI2, RAB18, PP2CA, and SOT12 were measured by quantitative real-time PCR in roots of non-treated plants and in plants treated with 100mM NaCl for 3, 6, 9, and 12h. Actin2 and UBQ10 were used as internal controls. The expression of the genes in non-treated controls at the respective times was set to 1. Data represent the means SE, n=2 discrete samples from one biological experiment. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results..
PMC3814343	Results. . OCP3 is targeted to plastids. OCP3 was classified as a transcription factor as it contained a 60-amino acid domain resembling a homeodomain and carried also two canonical bipartite nuclear localization signals [25] (Figure 1A). These features were interpreted as indicative of targeting OCP3 to nuclei, where it would be functioning as a negative regulator of plant immunity and was congruent with ocp3 plants exhibiting a remarkable enhanced resistant to fungal pathogens due to a primed immune state [25]-[27]. However, when Arabidopsis were transformed with a gene construct carrying the fluorescent YFP protein fused to the OCP3 N-terminus or, alternatively, to the C-terminus (i.e. 35S::YFP-OCP3 and 35S::OCP3-YPF constructs, respectively), confocal microscopy revealed different subcellular localizations for each protein (Figure 1B). YFP-OCP3 expression led to YFP-specific fluorescence at dispersed positions within the cell, while that derived from OCP3-YFP was unequivocally localized to the chloroplast (Figure 1B). These different protein localizations were reproduced upon transfecting tobacco protoplasts using the same constructs (Supplemental Figure S1). Western blot using an anti-GFP antibody, revealed YFP-OCP3 accumulated as a YFP immunoreactive band similar to that observed for free YFP (Figure 1C). This was interpreted as partial trimming or processing of YFP-OCP3. Conversely, the OCP3-YFP protein was stable, and accumulated as two low migrating immunoreactive bands; the molecular weight of these polypeptides congruent with that expected for a fusion OCP3 with YFP (Figure 1C). Furthermore, the 35S::OCP3-YFP gene construct, but not 35S::YFP-OCP3, complemented the ocp3 phenotype following stable transformation (Figure 1D). The ocp3 mutant line carried a copy of the pathogen- and H2O2-responsive Ep5C::GUS transgene that became constitutively active in the mutant (revealed after staining with X-gluc) [25], [28], therefore, complementation was recorded as Ep5C::GUS expression repression (Figure 1D). Eight independent ocp3/35S::OCP3-YFP lines were assayed, and all showed repressed GUS expression (Figure 1D), indicative of effective complementation; in all cases the OCP3-YFP protein was targeted to the chloroplast (Figure 1E). However, all 12 independent ocp3/35S::YFP-OCP3 transformed lines we generated retained GUS expression driven by the Ep5C gene promoter, demonstrating the inability of YFP-OCP3 to complement ocp3.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003713.g001.

Inspection of OCP3 with TargetP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/) revealed a predicted 69 amino acid chloroplast signal peptide (SP) (Figure 1A). Correspondingly, N-terminal amino acid sequencing using Edman degradation of OCP3-YFP protein revealed processing at the predicted site (Polyp2; Supplemental Figure S2A). Furthermore, fusion of the first 81 amino acids of OCP3 to YFP (i.e. OCP31-81-YFP) was sufficient to target and internalize YFP to the chloroplast (Supplemental Figure S2B-C). Interestingly, chloroplast targeting, but not internalization, occurred when a short deletion (from aa 68-to-74) was introduced in the constructs (OCP3delta68-74-YFP; Supplemental Figure S2B-C), indicating amino acids at position 68-to-74 were critical for proteolytic maturation of OCP3 in the chloroplast. These results were congruent with the absence of ocp3 complementation with deleted OCP3delta68-74-YFP, and lack of mature OCP3-YFP protein accumulation in transformed plants (Supplemental Figure S2D-E). Immunoblot analysis of chloroplast suborganellar fractionations derived from plants expressing OCP3-YFP revealed incorporation of the protein into the chloroplast, and enrichment in the stroma and thylakoid fractions (Supplemental Figure S2F). Collectively, these results indicated a functional OCP3 protein resides in the chloroplast.. . . OCP3 localization overlaps with pTAC2, a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein. OCP3-YFP distribution within the chloroplast showed protein accumulated in the form of speckles or punctate patterns. We noted similarities among proteins targeting different plastid structures or molecules, including plastoglobules (i.e. PGL34, [29]), plastid nucleoids (PEND, [30]), targeting associated with introns containing RNAs (i.e. WHIRLY, [31]) and with RNAs undergoing editing (i.e. pTAC2) (Figure 2A). We co-expressed the OCP3-mCherry protein with PGL34-YFP, PEND-RFP, WHIRLY-GFP, or pTAC2-YFP in protoplasts to demonstrate possible co-localizations. OCP3-mCherry fluorescence overlapped consistently with the fluorescence derived from the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein pTAC2-YFP (Figure 2B).. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003713.g002. Figure 2. . OCP3 co-localizes with pTAC2..

(B) Co-localization patterns of OCP3 with each of the proteins shown in (A). YFP- and GFP-specific fluorescence is shown in green, RFP- and mCHERRY-specific fluorescence is shown in red and chlorophyll-derived fluorescence is shown in blue.. . . . . . OCP3 is co-expressed with a cluster of nuclear genes encoding plastid PPR proteins. Transcriptionally coordinated genes tend to be functionally related [32]. We hypothesized that identification of genes that are co-expressed with OCP3 (at5g11270) in Arabidopsis would provide clues into the biological processes of OCP3 in the chloroplast. Therefore, we initially identified a co-expressed gene vicinity network for OCP3 using the AraGenNet platform (http://aranet.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/) [33] where OCP3 matched cluster 49 (Supplemental Figure S3). Based on functional annotation using MapMan ontology terms (http://aranet.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/), the co-expression network contained 207 genes significantly enriched for biochemical and regulatory aspects related to chloroplast development and function (see Table S1). A closer vicinity network including only genes two steps away from OCP3, identified 31 genes that were all related to plastid processes (Figure 3A and Table S2). Nine of these genes encoded PPR proteins, and the biological role in only one of these PPR genes, CRR21 (at5g55740), has been elucidated. CRR21 acts as a site-specific factor recognizing RNA editing site 2 (ndhD-2 site) in plastid ndhD transcript, suggesting that the Ser128Leu change has important consequences for the function of the NDH complex [13]. The remaining eight PPR genes, were tentatively named as follows: PPRa (at4g21190), PPRb (at4g30825), PPRc (at3g29230), PPRd (at3g46610), PPRe (at5g14350), PPRf (at1g15510), PPRg (at3g14330), and PPRh (at3g49140) (Figure 3A).. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003713.g003. Figure 3. . OCP3 is co-regulated with a subset of nuclear-encoded chloroplast PPR proteins.. (A) Co-expression gene vicinity network around the OCP3 node. This gene cluster was partitioned from the complex network illustrated in Supplementary Figure S3 and shows co-expressed genes that are only two steps away from OCP3. Nine out of the 31 genes of the cluster (see Table S2) encode PPR proteins and are indicated by circles, while OCP3 is indicated by a square. In addition to CRR21 (at5g55740), the other 8 PPRs surrounding OCP3 node have been tentatively name as PPRa (at4g21190), PPRb (at4g30825), PPRc (at3g29230), PPRd (at3g46610), PPRe (at5g14350), PPRf (at1g15510), PPRg (at3g14330) and PPRh (at3g49140). Nodes indicate individual genes, and edges indicate whether two genes are co-expressed above a certain mutual rank. Color codes for nodes and edges as in Supplementary Figure S3. Green, orange and red edges indicate a mutual rank relationship 10 (green), 10 but 20 (orange) and 20 but 30 (red), respectively, for each connected gene pair. GO characterization of the 31 genes is shown in Table 2. The network was generated, and modified from AraGenNet (http://aranet.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/aranet). (B) Chloroplast localization pattern of OCP3-CHERRY, PPRa (at4g21190)-YFP, CRR21-GFP, and At1g63680-YFP in protoplasts from N. benthamiana transfected with each respective construct as evaluated by confocal microscopy. (C) Chloroplast co-localization patterns of OCP3-CHERRY with OCP3-YFP and of OCP3-CHERRY with each of the other proteins shown in (B) in protoplast co-transfected with each of the indicated construct pairs. YFP-specific fluorescence is shown in green, CHERRY-specific fluorescence is shown in red and chlorophyll-derived fluorescence is shown in blue.. . . . As for pTAC2, plastidial overlapping localization pattern was observed for OCP3-mCHERRY and PPRa-YFP (Figure 3B-C). Similarly, OCP3-mCHERRY overlaps with CRR21-YFP both following the same punctate distribution pattern (Figure 3B-C). The common co-localization pattern of OCP3 with different PPR proteins was not followed by all other proteins whose genes where co-expressed with OCP3, as deduced from the non-overlapping localization pattern in OCP3-mCHERRY and AT1G63680-YFP (Figure 3B). The observed common localization of OCP3 and different PPR proteins suggested involvement of OCP3 in some aspects of plastidial RNA editing processes. . . OCP3 is required for RNA editing of ndhB transcript in plastids. To test the involvement of OCP3 in RNA editing, we systematically examined the editing status of chloroplast transcripts derived from wild type and ocp3 plants using high-resolution melting (HRM) screen of the 34 sites undergoing editing in Arabidopsis [7]. We identified major defects in the RNA editing of ndhB-6, nhdB-4, ndhB-3, and ndhB-2 sites in ocp3 plants (Figure S4). The comparison of the sequencing electrophoregrams of the RT-PCR products surrounding the editing sites confirmed that editing was compromised at the four indicated sites, if not totally at least partially, in ocp3 plants (Figure 4A and Figure S6). All other known sites appeared similarly edited in ocp3 plants as in Col-0 plants. Editing defects were further confirmed by poisoned primer extension (PPE) assays (Figure 4B-E). ndhB-6, ndhB-4, and ndhB-3 sites were edited in Col-0 at estimated efficiencies of approximately 72%, 95%, and 88%, respectively, while in ocp3 plants efficiencies were reduced approximately to 55%, 89%, and 72%, respectively (Figure 4B and 4D). The ndhB-2 editing site possessed a contiguous cytosine residue adjacent to the cytosine to be edited, which impeded a reliable PPE assay. Therefore, ndhB-2 was not further studied by this method. The ndhB-5 site exhibited no editing variation between Col-0 and ocp3, with efficiencies in the range of 82.5% and 81%, respectively; therefore, it served as an internal editing control site for the ndhB transcript not affected in ocp3 plants.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003713.g004. Figure 4. . Editing defects in ocp3 plants and in vivo association of OCP3 with ndhB RNA.. (A) Nucleotide sequences surrounding the RNA editing sites of ndhB-6 (95644), ndhB-5 (95650), ndhB-4 (96419), ndhB-3 (96579), ndhB-2 (96698) and ndhD-2 (116494) are shown as sequence chromatograms. The editing sites are specified relative to the nucleotide sequence of the complete Arabidopsis chloroplast genome (Genebank accession number AP000423). Editing sites are indicated by a red C residue in the genomic (gDNA) sequence and its conversion or not to a U(T) residue in Col-0 and ocp3 derived RNA samples. Editing defects in ocp3 are indicated by a blue mark above the corresponding peaks. (B-E) Poisoned primer extension (PPE) assays were conducted on the editing sites ndhB-6 (B), ndhB-5 (C), ndhB-4 (D) and ndhB-3 (E). RT-PCR products were obtained with labeled 6-carboxyfluorescein primers that anneals next to the target editing site (forward PPE primers were used for all sites). Acrylamide gels (below panels) were visualized under UV light, and intensity of bands quantified calculated and plotted. Bars represent mean  SD, n=3 independent replicates. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. E, edited; U, unedited, P; primer. (F) Comparative RNA editing efficiency in Col-0 and ocp3 plants as quantified from direct DNA sequencing of 100 independent cDNAs per genotype encompassing each of the indicated editing sites. (G) RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) of anti-HA precipitated protein complexes from leaves derived from Col-0 and a 35S::OCP3:YFP:HA transgenic line. The upper panel shows a Western blot of protein present in crude leaf extracts and proteins immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibody. The blot was developed with anti-GFP antibody and shows enrichment of the OCP3:YFP:HA protein in samples derived from the transgenic line. In the lower panel RT-PCR was used to detect association of ndhB transcripts with OCP3-enriched complexes in comparison to the corresponding input sample. Lack of association of ndhD transcripts with OCP3-enriched complexes is shown as a negative control.. . . . Sequencing of individual cDNA clones, in sufficient quantities, is considered the most accurate method to measure editing extent, but is not cost effective for large-scale studies. We sequenced individual cDNA clones derived from RNAs obtained from equivalent leaves from Col-0 and ocp3 plants. cDNA cloning strategy was designed to include the ndhB-4, ndhB-3, and ndhB-2 sites in one amplicon (amplicon I) and the ndhB-6 site, along with non-altered ndhB-5, and ndhB-7 sites, in another amplicon (amplicon II). One hundred cDNA clones for each amplicon, and for each genotype were analyzed by direct sequencing. Editing efficiency comparison is shown in Figure 4F. For the ndhB-4 site, Col-0 showed a 92% (92 of 100 sequenced clones) editing extent, which was reduced to 71% in ocp3 plants. Col-0 showed a 94% editing extent for ndhB-3, reduced to 77% in ocp3. The ndhB-2 site exhibited an editing extent of 86% in Col-0, which was reduced to 64% in ocp3. These values were comparable to those observed for the PPE assays. Interestingly, ocp3 plants exhibited concurrent editing inhibition at two sites within the same cDNA clone (of the three potential ones in amplicon I) in 21% of the sequenced clones while in Col-0 it was only 3%. Furthermore, lack of concurrent editing at the three sites remained notable in ocp3, and was observed in 8% of the sequence clones while in Col-0 it was 0%. These results suggested the concomitant editing inhibition at more than one site on the same ndhB transcript was a common feature in editing defects in ocp3 plants. The ndhB-6 site showed an editing extent of 81% in Col-0 plants, which was reduced to a 61% in ocp3 plants (Figure 4F). ndhB-5 and ndhB-7 served as controls for non-variation sites within the same transcript, and the editing extent was similar between Col-0 and ocp3 plants (83% reduced to 81% for ndhB-5; and 76% increased to 78% for ndhB-7) (Figure 4F). Collectively these data indicated that OCP3 is required for efficient ndhB transcript edition.. . . In vivo association of OCP3 with ndhB RNA. To directly assess the association of OCP3 with ndhB transcripts, leaves from Col-0 and from a transgenic line expressing a 35S::OCP3:GFP:HA gene construct were treated with folmaldehyde to generate protein-RNA cross-links and subsequently subjected to RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), an analysis that serves to detect the presence of the corresponding RNA in the protein immunoprecipitate by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Immunoprecipitation of crude protein extracts with an anti-HA antibody selectively enriched the chimeric OCP3 protein in samples derived from the 35S::OCP3:YFP:HA overexpressing line (Figure 4G, upper panel). Interestingly, the immunoprecipitated OCP3 complexes were shown to specifically co-precipitate ndhB transcripts as revealed by comparative RT-PCR analysis of the corresponding samples derived from the transgenic line and Col-0 plants (Figure 4G, lower panel). ndhD transcripts, which served as a negative control, did not show association with the OCP3 complex (Figure 4G, lower panel). The results thus indicate that OCP3 associates in vivo with ndhB transcript. Whether this association is the result of a direct interaction of OCP3 with the RNA molecule, or rather a consequence of the interaction of OCP3 with an RNA binding protein recognizing specifically RNA sequences of the ndhB transcript remains unknown. Future characterization of such protein complex and the elucidation of its associated biochemical function will shed light on how editing of the ndhB RNA at their multiple editing sites is regulated.. . . ocp3 plants are impaired in NDH activity. Normal RNA editing at ndhB-6, ndhB-4, ndhB-3 and ndhB-2 sites converts a Ser codon to a Leu codon at aa279, a Ser to Phe at aa249, a His to Tyr at aa196, and a Pro to a Leu at aa156 in the NdhB protein. NdhB is one of the eleven chloroplast-encoded subunits of the chloroplast NDH complex. We hypothesized ndhB editing defects observed in ocp3 plants would affect encoded protein function, which in turn would alter photosynthetic parameters in the mutant. NDH complex activity can be monitored as a transient increase in chlorophyll fluorescence reflecting plastoquinone pool reduction after turning off actinic light, as originally demonstrated by Shikanai et al. [11]. Figure 5A shows a typical chlorophyll fluorescence trace from Arabidopsis Col-0 and its comparison with crr21, a mutant lacking NDH activity. In ocp3, the post-illumination increase in chlorophyll fluorescence was modified in a manner similar to what occurred in crr21 plants, indicating that NDH activity was compromised. This result strongly indicated OCP3 is a chloroplast factor pivotal in normal NDH complex function. This important phenotype was confirmed by employing additional mutant alleles. Due to the absence of T-DNA insertions mutants for the OCP3 locus, and being the ocp3 mutant currently used a loss-of-function EMS mutant, we generated additional mutant alleles of this gene by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) interference. Two independent homozygous amiRNA lines (i.e. amiRNA-2 and amiRNA-3) phenocopying the original ocp3 mutant (Figure S5A-D), were selected. These lines were designated ocp3-2 and ocp3-3, respectively, and the original ocp3 now designated ocp3-1. Defective NDH activity was recorded in these mutants (Figure 5A). Complementation of ocp3-1 plants with an OCP3 wild-type sequence fully restored the post-illumination increase of chlorophyll fluorescence (Figure 5A). These results confirmed the importance of OCP3 for appropriate NDH complex function.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003713.g005. Figure 5. . Monitoring of NDH activity by using chlorophyll fluorescence analysis..

The bottom curve indicates a typical trace of chlorophyll fluorescence in the wild type (WT). Leaves were exposed to AL (50 mol photons m-2 s-1) for 5 min. AL was turned off and the subsequent transient rise in fluorescence caused by plastoquinone reduction based on NDH activity monitored. Insets are magnified traces from the boxed area. The fluorescence levels were normalized by the maximum fluorescence at close PSII centers in the dark (Fm) levels; ML, measuring light; SF, a saturating flash of white light.

(B) Immunoblot analysis of NDH NdhI and NdhJ subunits, the subunit IV of cytochrome b6f (Pet-D) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Proteins were extracted from chloroplast preparations from each genotype and lanes loaded with 20 g protein.. . . . RNA editing results in amino acid changes that directly alter protein translation, function, or even may act to destabilize multiprotein complexes. The NDH complex is unstable when NdhD subunit is absent due to editing-mediated translation defects [34], [35]. The NdhB subunit defects observed in ocp3 plants were evaluated to determine the effects on NDH stability in vivo. Protein blots were analyzed using antibodies against the NdhI and NdhJ subunits, which served to monitor NDH complex stability (Figure 5B). NdhI and NdhJ accumulation levels did not experience noticeable changes in ocp3 mutants compared to Col-0 plants. Similarly, NDH complex stability remained intact in crr21 plants (Figure 5B). Although the exact function and organization of the whole set of subunits of the NDH complex in plants remains to be fully elucidated [36], our results indicate that the four amino acid residues in the NdhB subunit which were derived from editing-mediated codon conversion appear important for activity, but not for assembly of the NDH complex.. . . Chloroplast NDH activity-defective mutants show enhanced disease resistance. We hypothesized that via NDH complex inhibition, plants could develop an alerted immune status. This might explain why ocp3 plants exhibited enhanced disease resistance to fungal pathogens resulting from earlier and more intense callose synthesis and deposition following pathogen exposure [25], [26]. If so, then mutants showing similar chloroplast NDH complex defects would activate the same immune status, and become resistant to fungal attack. Consequently, we challenged crr21 and crr2 mutants with P. cucumerina, and studied disease susceptibility in comparison to the resistant ocp3 plants, and the susceptible Col-0 plants. CRR2 is a distinct PPR protein that functions in the intergenic RNA cleavage between rps7 and ndhB, which is essential for subunit B translation, and crr2 mutants are compromised in NDH activity [35]. ppra, a previously uncharacterized T-DNA mutant, defective in the expression of PPRa (Figure S8) encoding a PPR protein of unknown function that is highly co-expressed with CRR21 and OCP3 (Figure 3A), was also evaluated. Similarly, pprb, a T-DNA mutant defective in another co-expressed PPR of unknown function (Figure S7) was included in these experiments for comparison. Following inoculation with P. cucumerina, disease was scored 12 d after inoculation by following necrosis and chlorosis extent present in inoculated leaves. As expected, Col-0 plants were highly susceptible to P. cucumerina, and all inoculated plants showed extended necrosis accompanied by extensive proliferation of fungal mycelia (Figure 6A-B). The same disease susceptibility was observed in the pprb mutant, indicating this PPR gene is not essential in plant's defense activation (Figure 6A-B). In marked contrast, the inoculated crr21, crr2, and ppra plants responded with a substantial increase in disease resistance to P. cucumerina infection that was of a magnitude similar to that attained in ocp3 plants (Figure 6A-B). Comparative cytological observations were performed at the sites of attempted fungal infection and the degree of induced callose deposition induction in inoculated leaves was monitored after staining with aniline blue, and examination by fluorescence microscopy. Results indicated none of the mutants exhibited aniline blue staining in control leaves (Figure 6C). Col-0 and pprb plants deposited callose locally at sites demarcating the zones of extended fungal growth. In marked contrast, crr21, crr2, ppra, and ocp3 plants all exhibited intensified and highly localized callose deposition in response to fungal infection, which occurred at zones where fungal growth and colonization was impeded (Figure 6C-D). Consequently, heightened disease resistance, and increased callose deposition were concurring traits in mutants defective in the correct editing of RNAs encoding subunits of the chloroplast NDH complex.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003713.g006. Figure 6. . Comparative immune responses of plastid PPR-related mutants to inoculation with P. cucumerina.. (A) crr2, crr21, ppra, and pprb disease resistance responses to P. cucumerina compared with ocp3 and wild-type (Col-0) plants.

(D) The number of yellows pixels (corresponding to pathogen-induced callose) per million on digital photographs of infected leaves were used as a means to express arbitrary units (i.e. to quantify the image) at 48 h.p.i.

Different letters above bars indicate statistically significant differences between genotypes, according to one-way ANOVA (P<0.05, n=15).. . . . . . Fungal infection interferes with editing in plastids. The above results indicated that editing efficiency, chloroplast NDH activity, and disease resistance to fungal pathogens are linked traits mediated by OCP3. Fungal infection provokes local down regulation of OCP3 in wild type plants [25], therefore we hypothesized that following Col-0 inoculation with a fungal pathogen, editing inhibition of ndhB would very likely arise and, the NDH complex would consequently be affected. Therefore, we inoculated Col-0 plants with the fungal pathogen P. cucumerina and examined the editing status of RNAs corresponding to chloroplast-encoded subunits of the NDH complex (i.e, NdhB, NdhF, NdhG and NdhD) by bulk sequencing of RT-PCR products. We identified major alterations in the RNA edition of ndhB. Eight sites normally edited in the ndhB transcripts (i.e. ndhB-1 to ndhB-8) showed inhibition at 48 h.p.i. with P. cucumerina (Figure S6). Results for the other NDH subunit RNAs indicated only the editing status of ndhD transcript was notably affected, and only at position 117166 (ndhD-1 site) which controls NdhD translation (Supplemental Figure S6). These results surpass the four distinct defective editing sites identified in the ocp3 mutant (Figure S6 and Figure 4). Therefore, in addition to OCP3, other factors appeared to be targeted for the realization of the fungal-promoted editing inhibition.. Temporal recording in a time course experiment following P. cucumerina inoculation revealed that editing inhibition is an early plant response to fungal attack. Most inhibition changes at the identified pathogen-sensitive ndhB editing sites were induced early following P. cucumerina inoculation (at 12 h.p.i.), and were sustained up to 48 h.p.i (Figure 7A), indicating the special vulnerability of ndhB editing to pathogenic cues. Results showed the specific editing defects at the ndhD-1 site lagged behind ndhB editing inhibition, reaching maximal inhibition at 48 h.p.i (Figure 7A). Some of these early effects were further corroborated by specific PPE assays, which provided estimates that editing at ndhB-6, ndhB-5, and ndhB-3 sites were inhibited following pathogen inoculation at different efficiencies and declining rates. ndhB-6 editing inhibition was the most prominent, with an efficiency that abruptly dropped at 12 h.p.i. and progressively decayed thereafter (Figure 7B).. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003713.g007.

(H) Early induced down-regulation of NdhI protein accumulation in Arabidopsis seedlings by chitosan.

Data represent the mean  SD; n=3 biological replicates.. . . . . . Early chloroplast NDH complex destabilization is part of the immune response. Following these previous observations we asked if stability of the NDH complex could become also altered following fungal infection. To assess this, NDH complex stability was monitored by Western blots using antibodies against one of the NDH subunits (i.e. NdhI). We observed NdhI accumulation level decayed very early following pathogen inoculation, with apparent reduction occurring at 6 h.p.i. (Figure 7C). The decay was progressive and showed an approximate 50% reduction in NdhI protein at 24 h.p.i. (Figure 7C). The results suggested decay specificity for NDH complex protein, since chloroplast integrity, measured using other marker proteins (i.e., Pet-D, PSAD-2 and APX), did not change or even increase in response to the fungus (Figure 7C). The decay process was set in motion at early stages of infection, and was inversely correlated with fungal growth (Figure 7D). Furthermore, the observed pathogen-triggered dismantling of the NDH complex subunit preceded the activation of other plant responses, which are diagnostic of an activated plant immune response. Deposition of the cell wall beta-1,3-glucan polymer callose, identified and quantified following aniline blue staining of inoculated leaves, clearly lagged behind observed editing defects and dismantling of NDH complex (Figure 7E). Similarly, transcriptional activation of the defense related gene PDF1.2 followed editing defect accumulation (Figure 7F). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect on NdhI accumulation was mirrored by Botrytis cinerea inoculation, another fungal pathogen (Figure 7G). The decay in NDH subunit content promoted by B. cinerea (Figure 7G, right graph) was notable, but not as progressive as observed in P. cucumerina, presumably reflecting different infection styles for the two distinct fungal pathogens.. The rapid editing inhibition and the parallel dismantling of the NDH complex constitutes two early chloroplast responses to pathogens, evoking integration of these processes as part of the mechanism governing immune response activation. Therefore, we verified if editing inhibition and NDH complex destabilization could be similarly triggered by application of chitosan (2-amino-2-deoxy-(1-4)-beta-D glucopiranan), a naturally-occurring pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) compound able to elicit plant innate immune responses similar to those activated by complex fungal pathogens [37]. Results showed strong and rapid (within 2 h) down-regulation of NDH subunit accumulation was promoted by the sole application of chitosan to wild type Arabidopsis seedlings (Figure 7H). Interestingly, we observed also an early and abrupt down-regulation of OCP3, CRR21 and PPRa gene expression following chitosan treatment, which contrasted with the concurring high transcriptional activation of MYB51 (Figure 7I), the latter a transcription factor required for PAMP-triggered callose deposition in Arabidopsis [38]. Since CRR21, OCP3 and PPRa are nuclear-encoded chloroplast factors required for an effective plant immune response (Figure 6), the results indicate the existence of a nuclear PAMP-mediated transcriptional regulation of NDH complex-related editing regulatory genes as an integral component of innate immunity. This thus represents an additional layer of control of chloroplast NDH complex activity interconnecting nuclei and chloroplasts. Moreover, electrophoregrams comparison of bulk sequencing of RT-PCR products, generated at different times after chitosan treatment, revealed that chitosan-induced NDH complex dismantling was also accompanied by an early editing inhibition at seven ndhB editing sites, and at three ndhD editing sites (Figure S7). Therefore, these results provided additional support for the engagement of plastid RNA editing inhibition in plant immunity. Moreover, the observed rapid and transient dismantling of the NDH complex that follows perception of pathogenic cues suggests the engagement of a highly regulated proteolytic system in the chloroplast.

The AtGRDP2 (At4g37900) gene is located in chromosome 4, and its genomic organization consists of five exons and four introns. The AtGRDP2 cDNA is 2428 bp in length containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 2364 pb that encodes a protein of 787 aa. Protein sequence analyses revealed a domain of unknown function (DUF1399), a putative RNA binding motif (RNP), and a glycine-rich domain (GRD) in the AtGRDP2 protein (Figure S1A). The DUF1399 domain is located in the N-terminus and consists of 142 aa. The putative RNA binding motif (KGSCFLPM) is placed in the central region of the protein, and it is equivalent to RNP-1 (ribonucleoprotein-1) present in proteins with RNA chaperone activity (Lorkovi and Barta, 2002). The glycine-rich domain is found in the C-terminus (aa 713-766); this domain also contains interspersed cysteine residues (Figure S1A). Comparison of phylogenetically related GRDPs reveals that the three domains found in AtGRDP2 are conserved in the orthologous proteins analyzed (Figures S1, S2). AtGRDP2 is grouped with orthologous GRDPs of dicot plants (Figure S1B), mainly with proteins from the Brassicaceae species. A consensus glycine region [CG]GGGCGG[GC], elucidated by MEME program (Bailey and Elkan, 1994), was identified among the AtGRDP2 orthologs (Figures S1A, S2).. In the A. thaliana genome, in addition to AtGRDP2, we have identified three additional genes encoding proteins that also contain the DUF1399 domain, named AtGRDP1 (Rodrguez-Hernndez et al., 2014), At1g56230, and At4g37682. The AtGRDP1 protein also contains the RNP-1 and glycine rich-region domains, while the At1g56230 and At4g37682 encoded proteins lack these domains (Figure S1C).. . . AtGRDP2 is expressed throughout Arabidopsis development. AtGRDP2 tissue-specific expression pattern was evaluated by qRT-PCR at different developmental stages, in A. thaliana ecotype Col-0 plants of 18, 21, 26, 28, and 45 days old (Figures 1A,B). The highest AtGRDP2 expression levels were found in rosette leaves, in inflorescence tissues such as cauline leaves, buds, flowers, and in immature siliques (Figure 1A). In rosette and cauline leaves, the highest expression was detected in 28-day-old plants. In flowers, the maximum expression of AtGRDP2 was noticed at day 45; although expression in buds and flowers was detected as of day 26. Furthermore, AtGRDP2 gene expression was maintained in immature siliques, but expression fell toward baseline values in mature siliques (Figure 1A).. . Figure 1. . AtGRDP2 is expressed throughout Arabidopsis development. (A) qRT-PCR analysis was performed in Arabidopsis Col-0 tissues obtained from different developmental stages. Quantitation of the AtGRDP2 gene, expressed as relative mRNA expression levels (2-deltaCt), was calculated after normalization to the Arabidopsis UBQ5 gene. For each sample, three biological replicates were analyzed with their respective technical replicates. Letters indicate significant differences between samples according to Tukey's multiple comparison tests at P < 0.05. (B) Photographs show representative Arabidopsis plant at 18, 21, 26, 28 and 45 days. (C) Representative images of GUS histochemical staining of 45 day-old transgenic lines AtGRDP2::GFP-GUS-1 and -2 in buds, flowers and immature siliques; fertilized siliques (Fs), stigmas (St), internode region (I), and ovary (Ov) are indicated.. . . . AtGRDP2 expression in floral tissues was also evaluated using Arabidopsis reporter lines expressing the GFP-GUS fusion under the control of the AtGRDP2 promoter (2000 bp) (Figure 1C). GUS histochemical assays confirmed AtGRDP2 expression in flower organs and immature siliques (Figure 1C). GUS expression was detected on the stigmas (St), at the top of the ovary (Ov), internode region (I), and in floral buds and fertilized siliques (Fs).. . . AtGRDP2 gene is involved in Arabidopsis development. To address the biological functions of AtGRDP2 gene in plant growth and development, mutant and over-expression lines were characterized. The T-DNA homozygous line (Sail_387D04) was analyzed for the absence of AtGRDP2 transcript, confirming that the Sail_387D04 line is a null allele (Figure S3). The amiRAtGRDP2-1 line (-1.7-fold repression), and four Arabidopsis lines over-expressing the AtGRDP2 gene (35S::AtGRDP2-OE2 4.8-fold, -OE4 21.6-fold, -OE1 102.6-fold, and -OE3 451.3-fold) were selected for subsequent analyses (Figure S3D).. Growth rate was evaluated in 2-week-old Arabidopsis Atgrdp2 mutants and AtGRDP2 over-expression lines. At this stage, seedlings of knockout and knockdown lines exhibited smaller sizes than those of WT plantlets (Figure 2A), reflected in their root length and fresh weight (Figures 2B,C). Interestingly, the AtGRDP2 over-expression lines presented an opposite phenotype, resulting in a higher growth rate in comparison to WT seedlings, in both the aerial part and the roots (Figure 2A). The increased growth rate observed in 35S::AtGRDP2-OE3 plantlets could be attributed to a higher accumulation of AtGRDP2 transcript in this line (Figure S3). Since deregulation of AtGRDP2 gene results in plant growth alterations, we analyzed the flowering time under long- and short-day conditions (Figures 2D-I). In long-day conditions, AtGRDP2 over-expression lines showed faster development and early flowering in comparison with the WT (Figures 2D,E). Instead, the knockout and knockdown lines showed late flowering phenotype (Figures 2D,E). At day 34, the percentages of plants with inflorescences were as follows: >80% in the AtGRDP2 over-expression lines, 66% in the WT, 46.6% in the knockdown line and 40% in the knockout line. Regarding the number of rosette leaves, no significant differences were observed in most of the analyzed lines. The exception was in the 35S::AtGRDP2-OE1 which had more rosette leaves (Figure 2F).. . Figure 2. . Growth of Col-0, Atgrdp2-1, amiR-1, and AtGRDP2 overexpression lines. (A) Phenotype of 14-day-old WT, mutants and overexpression seedlings. Primary root length (B) and fresh weight (C) were measured. Estimation of main root length (cm) was determined by measuring the length of 30 plant roots of each line. The fresh weight (mg) of the seedlings was obtained on an analytical scale and the values obtained represent the means of three groups of 10 seedlings of each line. Estimation of flowering time in plants grown under long days. (D) Phenotype of 40 day-old plants, (E) distribution of flowering plants, and (F) rosette leaf number in Col-0, mutant, and over-expression lines (mean  SE n = 15). Estimation of flowering time in plants grown under short days. (G) Phenotype of 110 day-old plants, (H) distribution of flowering plants and (I) rosette leaf number in Col-0, mutant and over-expressing lines (mean  SE n = 15). Error bars denote SE and significant differences are indicated with different letters. One-Way ANOVA was used to analyze the data (P < 0.05) and differences among treatments were explored through Tukey's multiple comparisons tests.. . . . Flowering time experiments under short-day conditions exhibited similar behavior to that observed in plants grown in long-days. The AtGRDP2 over-expression lines showed early flowering in comparison with WT plants, knockout and knockdown lines (Figures 2G-I). Finally, no differences in the number of rosette leaves at the flowering time were found between WT and the analyzed lines (Figure 2I).. All previous experiments showed that the Atgrdp2-1 and amiR-1 lines have a delay in development; it might be possible that hormonal pathways controlling development are affected. Interestingly, Goda et al. (2004) reported that the AtGRDP2 belongs to a group of genes specifically regulated by indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We analyzed IAA levels in WT, mutant and overexpression lines (Figure 3A), and we observed that the 35S::AtGRDP2-OE2 and -OE4 over-expression lines accumulated the highest IAA levels (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the effect of auxins on AtGRDP2 gene expression was evaluated in the pAtGRDP2::GFP-GUS-1 reporter line. GUS histochemical analyses were carried out in 7 day-old pAtGRDP2::GFP-GUS-1 and -2 transgenic lines treated with 0, 1, and 10 muM IAA for 3 and 6 h (Figure 3B). Plant treatments with IAA show increases in GUS signal in the root-hypocotyl junction (collet), and in the root differentiation zone in comparison to non-treated plants. In addition, IAA induces GUS signal in the root elongation zone; however, no signal is detected in root meristematic zone in control and treated seedlings (Figure 3B).. . Figure 3. . (A) IAA content in Col-0, Atgrdp2-1, amiR-1, and AtGRDP2-OE1, OE2, OE3, and OE4 overexpression lines. Twenty-one days old plants were used for IAA quantification. The experiment was performed on three biological replicates with their respective three technical replicates. Different letters indicate significant differences between samples according to Tukey's multiple comparison tests at P < 0.05. (B) Modulation of pAtGRDP2::GFP-GUS expression patterns by IAA. Seven day-old seedlings were treated with 0, 1, and 10 muM of IAA for 3 and 6 h. Images show representative individuals of two independent lines of pAtGRDP2::GFP-GUS (line 1 and 2). Images were taken on a Leica microscope at 10X magnification and recorded using the Leica Application Suite 3.0.0 software. (C) Expression analysis of auxin-related genes. qRT-PCR was performed in 15 day-old seedlings of Col-0, Atgrdp2-1, and -OE3 overexpression line. Ten seedlings of each line per triplicate were used. For the qRT-PCR analysis it was used SYBR green dye, with the respective technical replicates. Normalized fold change was calculated comparing the target gene expression with a control (Col-0), after normalization to the Arabidopsis UBQ5 gene using the (2-deltadeltaCt) method. In case of ratios lower than 1, the inverse of the ratio was estimated and the sign was changed.. . . . AtGRDP2 appears to be an auxin-regulated gene, and the difference in IAA concentrations might be responsible for the accelerated growth rate phenotype observed in AtGRDP2 overexpression lines. The relation between auxins and AtGRDP2 gene was also explored by measuring the expression of Auxin Response Factors (ARF2, ARF6, ARF8), miR167, and the auxin transporter AUX1 by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, the ARF6, ARF8, and AUX1 genes are induced in the 35S::AtGRDP2-OE3 line and repressed in the Atgrdp2-1 mutant (Figure 3C); opposite to ARF2 which is induced in the Atgrdp2-1 line. The miR167, which is a negative regulator of ARF6 and ARF8 transcription factors, was found up-regulated in the Atgrdp2 mutant, and decreased in 35S::AtGRDP2 overexpression line (Figure 3C).. . . Overexpression of AtGRDP2 in Arabidopsis improves recovery after salt stress. Two-week old Arabidopsis Col-0, Atgrdp2 mutants and overexpression lines were grown 7 days in 150 mM NaCl (Figure 4A). An evident salt stress sensitivity phenotype was observed in the mutant lines (Figure 4A). The relative primary root growth was slower for Atgrdp2-1 and amiR-1 compared with WT. The relative fresh weight was higher for 35S::AtGRDP2-OE overexpression lines (Figures 4B,D). After salt stress treatments, plantlets were transferred into sterile soil and the survival rate was calculated following a 7 days period of recovery. Plant survival rates indicate that more than 50% of the overexpression lines recovered while only 20% of Atgrdp2-1 was able to survive (Figure 4C). Our data show clear salt stress tolerance in AtGRDP2 overexpression lines.. . Figure 4. . Effect of salt stress on Arabidopsis Col-0, Atgrdp2-1, amiR-1, and AtGRDP2 overexpression lines.

(C) Data of fresh weight, and relative fresh weight (treated with 150 mM NaCl/untreated) for each line was represented graphically. (D) Survival rate of the Col-0, Atgrdp2-1, amiR-1, and AtGRDP2 overexpression lines after 7 days of salt stress recovery. Data are mean  SE (n = 10) from three replicates. Different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05) among lines were explored through Tukey's multiple comparisons tests.. . . . Furthermore, genes known to be induced by abiotic stress were analyzed by qRT-PCR in 15 day-old Col-0, Atgrdp2-1 mutant and 35S::AtGRDP2-OE3 overexpression lines grown 1 and 3 days under 125 and 150 mM NaCl. Expression levels of the selected genes: Responsive to Desiccation 29B (RD29B), Arabidopsis Early Methionine-Labeled 6 (EM6/LEA) and ABRE Binding Factor 4 (ABF4) are shown in Figure 5. These genes are ABA responsive and are mainly induced by stress conditions that involve cellular dehydration. In the 35S::AtGRDP2-OE3 overexpression line, EM6, ABF4, and RD29B genes were up-regulated under salt treatments at both times in comparison to WT plants. In contrast, all the analyzed genes were repressed in Atgrdp2-1 (Figure 5).. . Figure 5. . Expression levels of RD29B, EM6, and ABF4 genes in Col-0, Atgrdp2-1, and 35S::AtGRDP2-OE3 overexpression line during salt treatment. Fourteen days old plants grown on 0.5X MS plates were transferred to 0.5X MS medium containing 0, 125, and 150 mM NaCl, for 1 and 3 days. Ten seedlings of each line per triplicate were used. The expression levels were estimated by qRT-PCR with the respective three technical replicates using SYBR green dye. Normalized fold change was calculated comparing the target gene expression (under salt stress) with a control (untreated Col-0), after normalization to the Arabidopsis UBQ5 gene using the (2-deltadeltaCt) method. In case of ratios lower than 1, the inverse of the ratio was estimated and the sign was changed.. . . . . . AtGRDP2 overexpression in lettuce alters growth, development, and flowering time. Transgenic lettuce T3 homozygous lines that overexpress the AtGRDP2 gene were generated, and AtGRDP2 expression was estimated by qRT-PCR, observing different levels of AtGRDP2 transcript in the lettuce 35S::AtGRDP2-Ls1, -Ls5, and -Ls9 lines. In WT lettuce, AtGRDP2 expression was not detected as expected (Figure S3E). Overexpression of AtGRDP2 gene positively affects the growth rate of lettuce plants at early stages of development (7 day-old plants; Figure 6A). The 35S::AtGRDP2-Ls5 and -Ls9 exhibited faster growth, developed higher fresh weight and longer primary roots than WT plants (Figures 6A-C). In contrast, the 35S::AtGRDP2-Ls1 line, was phenotypically similar to the WT, with no statistical differences in fresh weight and primary root length (Figures 6A-C). The increased growth rate phenotype correlates with AtGRDP2 gene expression in the lettuce transgenic lines (Figure 6A and Figure S3E). After, the transgenic and WT lettuce plantlets were grown in soil. As previously observed, 30 day-old plants of the 35S::AtGRDP2-Ls5 and -Ls9 maintained the highest growth rates, and developed more leaves (Figure 6D). 60 day-old lettuce AtGRDP2 overexpression lines (-Ls1, -Ls5, and -Ls9) were higher than WT lettuces, reflected in their stem length (Figures 6F-H). No differences were observed in the number of leaves among transgenic and WT at this stage of development (Figures 6F-H). Owing the accelerated growth rate of AtGRDP2 transgenic lettuce lines, flowering time was also analyzed (Figures 6I,J). As expected, inflorescence development was accelerated in the transgenic lines. The 35S::AtGRDP2-Ls5 and -Ls9 transgenic lettuce plants flowered 76 days after sowing, 12 days before the WT, while in the 35S::AtGRDP2-Ls1 plants the difference was minor, 2 days before WT flowering time (Figures 6I,J).. . Figure 6. . Generation of lettuce transgenic plants overexpressing the Arabidopsis AtGRDP2 gene. (A) Phenotype of 7 day-old WT and transgenic lettuce plants; (B) primary root length, and (C) fresh weight of WT and transgenic lettuce plants was measured. (D) 30 day-old WT and transgenic lettuce plants, (E) the number of leaves in these plants is graphically represented. (F) 60 day-old WT and transgenic lettuce plants; (G) the number of leaves and (H) stem length are indicated. (I) 90 day-old WT and transgenic lettuce plants; (J) distribution of flowering plants in a period of 15 days is graphically represented. Data was obtained from 9 seedlings of each line, mean  SE (n = 9). Different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05) among lines were explored through Tukey's multiple comparisons tests.. . . . One interesting feature of the lettuce 35S::AtGRDP2 transgenic plants is the presence of light green leaves, in contrast to the dark green color observed in WT lettuce in all the developmental stages analyzed (Figure 6). For this reason, the chlorophyll content was estimated. No significant differences were observed in the total chlorophyll content between WT and transgenic plants (Figure S4). However, the chlorophyll a/b ratio was altered in transgenic plants, due to a higher chlorophyll b content (Figure S4). Furthermore, carotenoids content was measured. It was found that transgenic plants diminish their carotenoid content with age, i.e., 90 day-old-transgenic plants show up to 57% less carotenoids than WT lettuce plants (Figure S4C).. Finally, the response to salinity stress was evaluated in lettuce AtGRDP2 overexpression lines (Figure 7) grown under 150 mM NaCl for 21 days. At this time, salt tolerance was noticed in the overexpression lines; which had longer roots and increased fresh weight in comparison to WT plants (Figures 7B,C).. . Figure 7. .

PMC3739925	Results. . Using a specially developed microphenotyping system in a targeted approach to screen for l-Glu antagonists. A 96-well screening method was devised to enable the effects of large numbers of small molecules on root development to be analysed in detail (Figure 1a). The method was used to screen molecules both for their direct effects on root development and for their ability to block the effects caused by l-Glu. In the latter case, the test molecule was applied first, 2-3 days after germination, and the l-Glu was applied 2 days later, to allow time for a potential antagonist to exert its effect. Figure 1(b) shows untreated seedlings and Figure 1(c) shows seedlings treated with l-Glu only, illustrating how the distinctive l-Glu-elicited root phenotype can be readily observed in this system. An additional signature for the l-Glu effect was obtained using the J2301 enhancer trap line (Berger et al., 1998), which expresses GFP mainly in the root apex (Figure 1d). J2301 was found to respond to l-Glu treatment with a loss of GFP expression in the growth-inhibited primary root tip, but not in the still actively growing LR tips (Figure 1e).. . Figure 1. . The 96-well microphenotyping method developed to screen for l-Glu agonists and antagonists by monitoring chemically induced changes in root growth and development.. (a) Diagrammatic cross section of the device. Seedlings (GAL4-GFP line J2301) were grown in agar-filled microtubes (with between six and 12 seeds per tube, and with eight tubes per strip) that rested in the V-shaped wells of a microtitre plate. Test molecules were applied 2-3 days after germination by diffusion through the cut ends of the microtubes. l-Glu treatments, when applied, were initiated 2 days later (see Experimental Procedures).. (b) Control (untreated) seedlings photographed 12 days after germination.. (c) Seedlings (12 days old) that had been treated with l-Glu 5 days after germination (with a theoretical final concentration of 100 mum). The arrow indicates the position of the most advanced primary root tip at the time of treatment.. (d) Fluorescence image of the untreated primary root tips of J2301 taken in situ and showing the normal pattern of GFP expression.. (e) Micrograph of an l-Glu-treated root taken in situ using a combination of visible and fluorescent light, showing GFP expression in the lateral root (LR) tip and its absence in the distorted, growth-inhibited primary root tip.. (f) Light micrograph of roots 9 days after treatment with 20 mum PHCCC showing an inhibited primary root with abnormal root tip morphology and stunted LRs (arrowed).. (g) Fluorescence image showing pattern of GFP expression in a root treated with 4 mum PHCCC (8 days after treatment). Arrows indicate developmentally inhibited LRs.. (h) Light micrograph of agravitropic roots 9 days after treatment with 20 mum SDZ 220-040.. . . . Because of the known homologies between plant GLRs and the ancestrally related families of animal iGluRs, mGluRs and GABARs (Turano et al., 2001), we began with a targeted approach in which a set of 80 known agonists or antagonists of these mammalian receptors (Table S1) were screened for possible antagonists of the l-Glu response in roots. The pharmaceuticals were tested in duplicate at three concentrations (4, 20 and 100 mum), with and without the subsequent addition of l-Glu; however, none were found to alleviate the inhibitory effect of l-Glu, although a significant number on their own affected the root phenotype in different ways (Table S1). Two examples of this are shown in Figure 1. Root growth was strongly inhibited by N-phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC), a group-1 mGluR antagonist and a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR4 (Figure 1f). Although the PHCCC-induced thickening and curvature of the primary root tip was similar to that of an l-Glu-inhibited root, GFP fluorescence in this case was not lost (Figure 1g), and the LRs were highly stunted (Figure 1f,g). SDZ 220-040, a competitive antagonist of the mammalian NMDA receptor, induced a partially agravitropic pattern of root growth (Figure 1h).. . . Screening for l-Glu antagonists amongst a collection of bioactive yeast molecules. The Library of Annotated Compounds for Arabidopsis (LATCA) collection includes 1576 inhibitors of yeast growth identified from a screen of 50 000 Maybridge compounds (http://cutlerlab.blogspot.com/2008/05/latca.html). Our micro-phenotyping system was used to screen this enriched set of bioactive molecules in duplicate for potential l-Glu antagonists. Figure 2(a) shows two examples from the primary screen where pre-treatment with a test molecule prevented the subsequent inhibition of primary root growth by l-Glu. These two molecules, 2-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-2-oxoethyl thiocyanate (CMOT) and 1-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (DDPD), the structures of which are shown in Figure 2(b), belong to two distinct groups of structurally related compounds that were found to alleviate, or partially alleviate, the inhibitory effect of l-Glu. CMOT belongs to a group of active molecules that includes three other aromatic thiocyanates as well as a related molecule, 1-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]ethanedithioyl dicyanide (Table S2). The set of antagonists to which DDPD belongs are maleimides with a single aromatic group, 32 of which were present in the LATCA collection (Table S3). Of these, eight were identified as positives in the primary screen, but only DDPD has been investigated further.. . Figure 2. . A chemical library screen identified two groups of molecules that act as l-Glu antagonists.. (a) Using the microphenotyping system described in Figure 1, test molecules from the LATCA collection were applied 2 days after germination and l-Glu was applied 2 days later. The panel on the left shows roots treated with l-Glu alone and the other panels show the identification in the primary screen of two molecules (CMOT and DDPD) that overcame the effect of l-Glu on root growth and branching.. (b) Chemical structures of CMOT and DDPD. These represent two separate groups of structurally related molecules identified as l-Glu antagonists in this screen.. . . . . . Testing the specificity of the l-Glu antagonists. We investigated whether the antagonistic activities of CMOT and DDPD are specific to l-Glu or extend to other amino acids or hormones that inhibit root growth. The four amino acids tested (Gly, Asn, Cys and Ser) were chosen for their reported roles as agonists or regulators of GLR glutamate receptors in Arabidopsis (Dubos et al., 2003; Qi et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2008; Michard et al., 2011; Vincill et al., 2012), and for their ability to inhibit root growth in the concentration range 0.5-1 mm, as established in preliminary experiments. The results in Figure 3(a) confirm the ability of both CMOT and DDPD to antagonize the inhibitory effect of l-Glu and demonstrate their specificity for l-Glu. It was only in the case of Gly and the DDPD treatment that a minor antagonistic effect was observed; neither CMOT nor DDPD suppressed the inhibitory effect of the other amino acids.. . Figure 3. . Effect of l-Glu antagonists on root growth inhibition by other amino acids and plant hormones. Seedlings were cultivated in the microphenotyping system described in Figure 1.. (a) Antagonists (with a theoretical final concentration of 8.3 mum) were added to the microtitre wells 3 days after germination, and amino acids were added 2 days later to give theoretical final concentrations of 1 mm (Asn and Gly) and 0.5 mm (Cys and Ser). Root growth over the following 3 days was measured and the percentage inhibition was calculated by comparison with the corresponding (no amino acid) treatment (SEM; n = 8). Different letters indicate statistically significant differences between groups (P < 0.05).. (b) As for (a), except that the antagonist and hormone treatments were each given 1 day earlier and growth was measured over the 4-day period after hormone treatment (SEM; n = 8). The theoretical final concentrations were: 330 nm (ACC and kinetin) and 33 nm (IAA).. (c) Images showing the effect of CMOT and DDPD on the growth and morphology of roots treated with ACC or kinetin. Treatments were as described for (b), except that antagonist and hormone treatments were each given 1 day later. Images were captured 6 days after hormone treatments.. . . . We found that CMOT was able to significantly reduce the inhibitory effect of both the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and kinetin (Figure 3b,c), but had no effect on the inhibitory effect of indole acetic acid (IAA; Figure 3b). In contrast, DDPD had a small counteractive effect on inhibition by IAA, but had no effect on inhibition by either ACC or kinetin (Figure 3b,c). Note that, as seen in the top panels of Figure 3(c), neither CMOT nor DDPD at the concentrations used in these experiments had major effects on primary root elongation when present on their own.. . . Investigating the role of MAP kinases in the l-Glu response. Previously, in a screen of approximately 8000 small molecules, CMOT was identified as being able to specifically block the activity of the Ste11 MAP3K in yeast (Kitagawa et al., 2007). The A1 subgroup of Ste11-related MAP3Ks in Arabidopsis includes the MEKK1 gene, which can complement a yeast Ste11 mutant (Mizoguchi et al., 1996), and the closely related MEKK2, MEKK3 and MEKK4 genes (Ichimura et al., 2002).. To investigate whether MEKK1 or the other MEKK1-related genes are involved in l-Glu signalling, we began by testing the l-Glu sensitivity of root growth in single knock-out mutants of MEKK1 and the other three A1 subgroup members. Because the mekk1-1 mutant is infertile (Ichimura et al., 2006; Nakagami et al., 2006; Suarez-Rodriguez et al., 2007), it was necessary to analyse the segregating progeny of a MEKK1 mekk1-1 heterozygote, the distinctive dwarf phenotype of the homozygous mutant, making it possible to score root growth of mekk1-1 mekk1-1 and MEKK1/- seedlings separately. Roots of mekk1-1 mekk1-1 seedlings were slower growing than the parental line in the absence of l-Glu, but were much less sensitive to l-Glu, whereas MEKK1/- roots grew normally in the absence of l-Glu and were inhibited to the same degree as the wild type (Figure 4a). By contrast, the mekk2 (summ1-1), mekk3 and mekk4 single knock-out mutants were unaltered in their l-Glu sensitivity (Figure 4a).. . Figure 4. . Effect of mutations in MEKK1-related genes on root sensitivity to l-Glu.. (a) Seedlings (5 days old) of parental (Col-8) and mutant lines were transferred to vertical agar plates containing 0.5 mm Gln as a source of N, and either 2 mm KCl (control) or 2 mm l-Glu. For each line the percentage inhibition of primary root growth by l-Glu over the subsequent 6 days was calculated by comparison with the control treatment (SEM; n = 8-28). The mekk1 mutant was only available as segregating progeny from a MEKK1 mekk1-1 heterozygote, but the dwarf shoot phenotype of homozygous mekk1-1 seedlings (Suarez-Rodriguez et al., 2007) allowed the l-Glu sensitivity to be scored separately from MEKK1/-seedlings.. (b) Time course of primary root growth of Col-8 and mekk1/2/3 seedlings after transfer to control or l-Glu plates.. (c) Images taken after 5 days of growth on 2 mm l-Glu, showing contrasting patterns of lateral root (LR) proliferation in the apical regions of primary roots of Col-8 and mekk1/2/3 seedlings.. (d) Primary root growth of the mekk1/2/3 mutant and mekk1/2/3 rescue lines transformed with the MEKK1 gene (mekk1/2/3 + MEKK1) or the MEKK3 gene (mekk1/2/3 + MEKK3) after 8 days on medium, with or without 0.5 mm l-Glu (SEM; n = 9-12). The percentage inhibition by l-Glu has also been plotted for each line. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences between groups (P < 0.05).. . . . The pleiotropic phenotype of the mekk1-1 mutant (Ichimura et al., 2006; Nakagami et al., 2006; Suarez-Rodriguez et al., 2007) complicates our ability to interpret its reduced sensitivity to l-Glu. It has recently been demonstrated that the dwarf and autoimmune phenotypes of mekk1-1 can be suppressed by inactivating the MEKK2 gene (Kong et al., 2012), and consistent with this it has recently been found that a deletion mutation that disrupts the entire MEKK1-MEKK2-MEKK3 gene cluster (mekk1/2/3) is phenotypically similar to the wild type (Su et al., 2013). Use of the mekk1/2/3 mutant therefore allowed us to study the effect on l-Glu sensitivity of loss of MEKK1 function without the complication of the pleiotropic phenotype of the mekk1 single mutant. The triple mutant was found to be almost insensitive to l-Glu, with primary root growth continuing for at least 8 days at only a slightly reduced rate in the presence of 2 mm l-Glu compared with the control (Figure 4b). Furthermore, the dramatic effect on root architecture elicited by l-Glu in the wild type (Walch-Liu et al., 2006) was absent in the mekk1/2/3 mutant (Figure 4c), as quantified by expressing the total LR length per unit primary root length in the root zone developing after treatment (Figure S1).. To establish whether the absence of MEKK1 was responsible for the l-Glu insensitivity displayed by the mekk1/2/3 plants, we used a transgenic rescue line (mekk1/2/3 + MEKK1) in which the mekk1/2/3 mutant carried the wild-type MEKK1 gene driven by its native promoter (Su et al., unpublished data). Both LR and primary root growth, which are diminished in mekk1/2/3, are restored to wild-type levels in this rescue line (data not shown). Figure 4(d) shows that l-Glu sensitivity was also fully restored in mekk1/2/3 + MEKK1, whereas l-Glu sensitivity in another rescue line (mekk1/2/3 + MEKK3), carrying a wild-type copy of MEKK3 (Su et al., unpublished data), was very similar to mekk1/2/3 itself (Figure 4d).. The transgenic line mekk1 + K361M is a mekk1-1 mutant expressing a mutant version of MEKK1 in which Lys361, a conserved residue essential for normal kinase activity, has been substituted by Met (Suarez-Rodriguez et al., 2007). This line, which is fertile and grows normally, was previously used to provide evidence that the role of MEKK1 in the response of the plant to the flagellin elicitor peptide flg22 is independent of its full protein kinase activity (Suarez-Rodriguez et al., 2007). We found that root growth in mekk1 + K361M was as sensitive to l-Glu as in the wild type (Figure S2), indicating that the kinase activity of MEKK1 is similarly not required for l-Glu signalling.. . . Sensitivity of the mekk1/2/3 triple mutant to other inhibitors of root growth. The l-Glu specificity of the mekk1/2/3 mutant phenotype was investigated by testing the sensitivity of its roots to inhibition by the other four previously selected amino acids. Figure 5(a) shows that the triple mutant was at least as sensitive to Cys, Gly, l-Ser and Asn as the wild type. Note that the slightly increased sensitivity to Cys seen here was not reproduced in other experiments.. . Figure 5. . Sensitivity of the mekk1/2/3 mutant to other amino acids.. (a) Seedlings (5 days old) of Col-8 and mekk1/2/3 were transferred to plates containing either 0.5 mm Gln alone (control) or 0.5 mm Gln plus 0.5 mm l-Glu, 2 mm Gly, 0.5 mm Cys, 1 mm Ser or 2 mm Asn. The percentage inhibition of primary root growth by each amino acid was determined by measuring primary root growth over the following 8 days and comparing it with the control. Asterisks indicate where the difference between the parental line and the mutant is statistically significant (Student's t-test: *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001).. (b) Time course of primary root growth of Col-8 and mekk1/2/3 seedlings after transfer to control plates or plates containing 1 mum flg22.. . . . One of roles of MEKK1 is as part of a MAP kinase cascade, downstream of the flagellin receptor FLS2, which detects the presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) such as the flagellin peptide flg22 (Ichimura et al., 2006; Nakagami et al., 2006; Suarez-Rodriguez et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2008). As one of the plant responses to flg22 is the strong inhibition of root growth (Gomez-Gomez et al., 1999), we considered the possibility that l-Glu and flg22 could act on root growth through the same MEKK1-mediated pathway; however, as shown by the growth curves in Figure 5(b), mekk1/2/3 roots were almost as sensitive to inhibition by flg22 as wild type roots (56 and 66% inhibition, respectively), indicating that flg22 affects root growth largely through a MEKK1-independent pathway..
PMC4130666	Results. . The axr1 Mutants Are Meiosis-Defective. In the process of screening A. thaliana T-DNA (Agrobacterium tumefaciens transferred DNA) insertional lines for meiotic defects, we isolated three mutants [EGS344, EIC174, and EVM8 (Ws-4 strain); Figure 1 and Figure S1] allelic for disruption in At1g05180, the AXR1 gene, previously shown to encode the E1 enzyme of the Arabidopsis neddylation complex [44]. Another insertion line in At1g05180 available in the public collection (http://signal.salk.edu/) Sail_904E06 (N877898, Col-0 strain) and the historical axr1 allele (axr1-12/N3076, Col-0 ecotype [44], with a single nucleotide substitution in exon 11 of At1g05180) were also included in this study (Figure 1).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.g001. Figure 1. . The AXR1 gene and axr1 mutations.. The arrow indicates the orientation of the open reading frame. Exons are shown as boxes (pink, UTR; black, CDS). In the EGS344 mutant, a large deletion associated with an insertion of the exogenous Agrobaterium Ti plasmid disrupts the AXR1 gene from nucleotide 91 (40 bp 5 to the ATG). In the EVM8 mutant, an in-frame deletion of 312 bp between exons 3 and 4 generates a 20 aa truncated protein. In EIC174, a single nucleotide insertion (A) in exon 6 (position 1364 of the genomic sequence, corresponding to nt 688 in the cDNA) leads to a premature stop codon (a 222 aa protein is produced instead of the 540 aa protein in wild type). In axr1-12, corresponding to the N3076 line, a single C-T nucleotide substitution at position 1295 of the cDNA leads to a premature stop codon (415 aa instead of 540), as described by Leyser et al. [44]. In N877898, corresponding to the Sail_904E06 line, a T-DNA insertion occurred in intron 11. References used for this figure are Tair accession 4010763662 for the genomic sequence and Tair accession 4010730885 for the cDNA sequence.. . . . The mutant plants all show the same vegetative phenotypes as previously described for axr1 mutants: They are dwarfed, excessively branched, with small rosettes and crinkled leaves (shown for N877898 in Figure 2A-B and in Figure S2 for the other alleles) [45],[46]. They also have small flowers and short fruits, indicating fertility defects (Figure S2).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.g002. Figure 2. . . axr1 developmental defects.. Five- (A) or nine- (B) week-old wild-type (wt) or axr1 (N877898) mutant plants. axr1 mutants are dwarfed, strongly branched, and have short siliques. Alexander staining (C-D) reveals round pollen grains, with a red cytoplasm reflecting viable male gametophytes in wild type (C), whereas axr1 (N877898) anthers (D) contain a mixture of viable and dead (uncoloured, arrows) pollen grains. DIC microscopy of male meiosis products (E and F) reveals tetrads of microspores in wild-type (E) and unbalanced tetrads or polyads in axr1 (F, N877898).. . . . We examined the reproductive development of these mutants and found that all alleles showed a high level of male and female gametophyte abortion [shown for N8779898 male gametophytes (pollen grains) in Figure 2D]. In plants, male gametogenesis occurs in the anthers where groups of meiocytes undergo meiosis synchronously, each producing four haploid cells (called microspores). The four products of each meiosis remain temporally encased in a common callose wall, forming tetrads of microspores that can be visualised after tissue clearing (Figure 2E). Each microspore is then released from its tetrad and continues to develop into a mature pollen grain (the male gametophyte) containing the male gametes. Study of the early stages of pollen development in axr1 revealed the presence of abnormal meiotic products. Instead of the regular tetrahedral structure observed in the wild-type, asymmetric tetrads (containing four daughter cells of unequal size) or polyads (containing more than four products) were observed (Figure 2F), suggesting that the meiotic program is disrupted in these mutants.. To confirm that the reduced fertility was caused by a defect in meiosis, we investigated male meiosis via chromosome spreading and DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining (Figure 3). During wild-type meiotic prophase I (Figure 3A-D), DNA fibres of each sister chromatid are organised as chromatin loops connected to a common protein axis (the axial element [AE]) [47]. When chromosomes start to condense at leptotene, they become visible as threads (Figure 3A). At this stage, meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation of a large number of DNA DSBs (not shown). HR repairs these breaks concomitantly with the progression of synapsis, the close association of the homologous chromosome axes through the polymerisation of the central element (CE) of the synaptonemal complex (SC). Synapsis begins at zygotene (not shown) and is complete by pachytene, when complete alignment of homologous pairs can be detected in DAPI-stained chromosomes (Figure 3B). DNA repair and recombination are thought to be achieved during pachytene, yielding at least one CO per homologous chromosome pair. At diplotene (Figure 3C), when the CE of the SC is depolymerised, the homologous chromosomes are therefore connected to each other by COs in which chromatids from homologous chromosomes have been exchanged. These connections between homologous chromosomes become apparent only at diakinesis (Figure 3D, arrows), when chromosomes are sufficiently condensed. At this stage in Arabidopsis, chiasmata (the cytological manifestations of COs) cannot be scored precisely, but chiasma-carrying chromosome arms can sometimes be identified based on bivalent appearance (see Figure 3D, arrows). Next, condensation proceeds and, at metaphase I, the five Arabidopsis bivalents are easily distinguishable, aligned on the metaphase plate (Figure 3E). During anaphase I, sister chromatid cohesion is released from chromosome arms, allowing homologous chromosomes to segregate to the two opposite cellular poles (Figure 3F). The second meiotic division then separates the sister chromatids, generating four pools of five chromosomes (Figure 3G and 3H), which gives rise to the tetrads of four spores (Figure 2E).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.g003. Figure 3. . . axr1 mutants show normal meiotic progression but reduced bivalent formation at metaphase I.. DAPI staining of meiotic chromosomes in wild type (A-H) and axr1 (N877898, I-P). At the onset of meiotic prophase I (A and I), chromosomes can be identified. Chromosome alignment and synapsis then proceeds, leading eventually to the pachytene stage in wild type (B), where homologous chromosomes are synapsed along their entire length. This association can be observed in axr1 (J, enlarged regions) but remains partial. Then, the SC disappears at diplotene (C and K), condensation proceeds, and bivalents can be identified in wild type at diakinesis (D), but this stage is rarely observed in axr1 (L). At metaphase I, the five Arabidopsis bivalents can be identified in wild type (E), segregating at anaphase I (F). In axr1, a mixture of bivalents and univalents are observed (M), leading to subsequent improper segregation at anaphase I (N). Sister chromatids segregate at meiosis II (G and O), leading to balanced tetrads in wild type (H), unbalanced tetrads (not shown) or polyads in axr1 (P). At metaphase I, univalents (u) can be distinguished from ring bivalents (where a chiasma occurred in each of the two chromosome arms, *) and from rod bivalents (where only one chromosome arm shows a chiasma, #). Arrows in (D) indicate some of the chiasma-containing arms. Bar, 10 m.. . . . In A. thaliana axr1 mutants, the leptotene and zygotene stages appeared similar to those in the wild type. However, no pachytene cells were identified in the 457 meiocytes analysed, in contrast to wild type, where this stage is present in approximately 35% of the cells (n=334). Instead, we observed pachytene-like stages, with only partial chromosome alignment (Figure 3J). This suggests that axr1 is defective in synapsis. Diplotene cells were indistinguishable from those in the wild type (Figure 3K). Then, chromosome condensation could be followed until metaphase I, although diakinesis stages were rarely observed (1% of all stage cells, n=457 for N877898, 12% in wt, n=334) (Figure 3L).. At wild-type metaphase I, the five typical Arabidopsis bivalents could be observed aligned on the metaphase plate (Figure 3E). Each bivalent was composed of two homologous chromosomes connected by chiasmata either on one chromosome arm (rod bivalent, Figure 3E#) or on both pairs of chromosome arms (ring bivalent, Figure 3E*). Chiasma numbers could therefore be estimated based on the bivalent structure. However, because multiple COs on a single arm cannot be cytologically differentiated from single COs, these estimates only correspond to a minimum chiasma number (MCN; Figure 4, Table S1).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.g004. Figure 4. . COs in axr1 are largely ZMM-dependent.. For each axr1 allele and for their respective wild-type strains (Ws-4 for EGS344, EIC174, EVM8, and Col-0 for N8777898 and N3076), and for a combination of multiple mutants, the level of bivalent formation as well as the MCN per cell were measured. For multiple mutant analyses, the N877898 allele was used in a Col-0 background and EGS344 in a Ws-4 background. The complete dataset can be found in Table S1.. . . . In axr1 mutants, we observed reduced bivalent formation, and instead of five bivalents, a mixture of bivalents and univalents could be identified (Figure 3M). The reduction in bivalent formation resulted in chromosome mis-segregation during subsequent anaphase I (Figure 3N), whereas the second meiotic division separated sister chromatids (Figure 3O), giving rise to a variable number of daughter cells containing aberrant numbers of chromosomes (Figure 3P).. We quantified the decrease in bivalent formation as well as the MCN at metaphase I from all axr1 mutants and their respective wild-type accessions (Figure 4, Table S1). On average, axr1 mutants had 78% of the wild-type number of bivalents for the Col-0 background and 52% for the Ws background. In terms of the chiasma number, axr1 mutants displayed a residual level of 56% and 41% of the wild-type levels for Col-0 and Ws strains, respectively (Figure 4). Within a single ecotype (Col-0 or Ws), all alleles were statistically different from the wild type but not different from each other. Finally, when the partitioning of the residual chiasmata in axr1 was analysed, we observed that a large proportion of metaphase I cells showed both ring bivalents (at least two chiasmata) together with univalents (no chiasma) (42% of the N877898 cells, n=47), showing that in axr1, the obligatory CO is lost.. To further analyse the bivalent shortage observed in axr1, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses on PMCs. Metaphase I chromosomes were labelled with probes for the 45S and 5S rDNA repeats, allowing specific identification of chromosomes 1, 2, and 4 (Figure 5). Chromosomes 3 and 5 could not be discriminated from each other with these probes and were pooled. First, we observed that in axr1 as in wild type, bivalents were always formed between homologous chromosomes (n=147 bivalents for axr1, n=165 for wt). Then, we considered each bivalent individually and determined which pair of chromosomes was involved in its formation. As shown in Figure 5D, in axr1, as in the wild type, each pair of chromosomes was equally involved in bivalent formation, showing that the decrease in bivalent formation observed in axr1 affected all chromosomes in the same way.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.g005. Figure 5. . Bivalent shortage has a similar effect on each pair of chromosomes.. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) on metaphase I cells was performed with probes directed against the 45S (green) and the 5S (red) rDNA, which allow the identification of chromosomes 1 (unlabelled), 2 (green labelled), and 4 (green and red labelled), whereas chromosomes 3 and 5 cannot be distinguished (red labelled). In wild type, each chromosome pair represents 20% of the total number of bivalents (A and D, centre circle, in light, n=21 cells). In axr1 (B and D, N877898 allele, external circle, n=28), the proportion of each bivalent pair is the same as in wild type. Bar=5 m.. . . . . . axr1 COs Are ZMM-Dependent. In wild-type Arabidopsis, the majority of COs (85%-90%, depending on the genetic background Col-0 versus Ws-4) depend on the ZMM proteins (MSH4, MSH5, MER3, ZIP4, SHOC1/ZIP2, HEI10, and PTD) as well as on MLH1 and MLH3 [21],[48], whereas MUS81 is responsible for 10%-15% of the remaining COs [14],[22].. We measured bivalent formation frequencies and the chiasma frequencies in various genetic combinations compared to the single axr1 mutant (Figure 4, Table S1). For all the zmmaxr1 double mutants (except mer3axr1) and regardless of strain (Col-0 versus Ws-4), the level of bivalent formation was reduced by more than 95% with hardly any bivalents observed (from 0.13 to 0.18 bivalent per cell; Table S1), showing that almost all the COs in axr1 are ZMM-dependent.. We also analysed the bivalent frequency in the axr1mus81 double mutant, which was the same as for the axr1 single mutant (3.771.03 against 3.751.12; p=0.9) (Figure 4). We then quantified bivalent frequency in the axr1msh5mus81 triple mutant and observed, as expected, a dramatic decrease in bivalent formation compared to axr1mus81 (Figure 4). No difference could be detected between the axr1msh5mus81 triple mutant and the axr1msh5 double mutant (p=0.2). These results show that CO formation in axr1 mutants is almost exclusively dependent on ZMM proteins, whereas the MUS81 pathway plays only a limited role, if any.. . . Class I COs Are Mislocalised in the axr1 Mutant. To further analyse recombination events in axr1, we immunolabelled chromosomes with antibodies directed against HEI10 and MLH1, two markers of class I COs in Arabidopsis. [48],[49]. MLH1 foci can be seen from late pachytene to diakinesis [49], whereas HEI10 is first loaded early during prophase on a large number of sites forming foci of different sizes on chromosomes. A limited number of these foci then remain (Figure 6A and B) at sites that correspond to class I COs where they co-localise with MLH1 until the end of prophase [48]. We therefore counted HEI10 and MLH1 foci in late pachytene and diplotene cells in wild type and axr1. Surprisingly, the average foci number per cell was not different between wild type and axr1, for either HEI10 (8.300.29, n=54 and 7.490.40, n=84, p=0.15) or MLH1 (8.610.29, n=33 and 7.580.54, n=91, respectively, p=0.263). In addition, we confirmed that these foci localise to chiasma-containing arms at diakinesis (Figure 6E and F and Figure S3), showing that they are likely to mark CO sites in axr1 as in wild type [49]. We also observed that there was higher variability in the numbers of HEI10 and MLH1 foci in axr1 than in wild type (Figure 6G), with the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) varying from 26% (HEI10, wt) to 50% (HEI10, axr1) or from 19% (MLH1, wt) to 68% (MLH1, axr1).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.g006. Figure 6. . The average number of class I COs is similar in wild type and axr1.. HEI10 or MLH1 was immunolocalised on acetic acid spread chromosomes from wild-type (A, B, and E, Col-0) or axr1 (C, D, and F) meiocytes from late pachytene to diakinesis. In axr1 (N877898 allele), the average number of HEI10 or MLH1 foci per cell is similar to that in wild type (G). Bar = 5 M.. . . . Another striking feature of axr1 was the frequent occurrence at the pachytene-like and diplotene stages of portions of paired chromosome axes where adjacent HEI10 and MLH1 foci could be seen (Figure 6C, D, arrows and Figure 7A, arrows). Forty-seven percent (HEI10, n=60) or 53% (MLH1, n=66) of the cells had at least two foci localised on the same portion of a chromosome axis, whereas in wild type, this scenario occurred only in 7% (HEI10, n=57) or 3% of the cells (MLH1, n=39) (Figure 7B). In addition, although we never observed more than two adjacent foci in wild type, we observed 22% (HEI10) and 13% (MLH1) of the cells with more than two adjacent foci, with a maximum of five adjacent HEI10 foci observed in axr1 (Figure 7B). Therefore, although the average level of class I COs is the same in axr1 and in wild type (Figure 6G), these class I COs tend to cluster together in at least 50% of the axr1 cells.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.g007. Figure 7. . Class I COs tend to cluster in axr1.. (A) Examples of adjacent HEI10 or MLH1 foci in wild-type (Wt, Col-0) and in axr1 (N877898 allele) acetic acid spread meiotic chromosomes. (B) Proportion of pachytene and diplotene cells where adjacent foci were observed on the same chromosome axis pair (Wt, wild type; axr1, N877898 allele) (0, no evidence of adjacent foci; 2, two adjacent foci, etc.). Some of these situations are indicated by arrows in panel A. Bar = 5 M.. . . . We then estimated the scale at which this clustering arises. The distance between clustered foci was measured and compared to the total length of chromosome axis. The distance between two adjacent foci was on average 1/400 of the total axis length of a cell, ranging from 1/1600 of the genome to a maximum of 1/90 of the genome (Figure S4A). Extrapolated in DNA distance, with the additional assumption that genome condensation is homogeneous, the distance between two adjacent foci in a cluster is therefore expected to vary from 150 kb to 3,000 kb, with an average of 625 kb. We also observed that the distance between two adjacent foci does not vary significantly in clusters with exactly two foci compared with clusters with more than two foci. As a consequence, cluster size increases proportionally with the number of foci present in the cluster (Figure S4B). The size of the clusters was on average 1/200 of the genome for HEI10 foci (n=14, 1,200 kb) and 1/300 for MLH1 (n=21, 800 kb).. Finally, we examined whether the clustered foci displayed interference, as might be expected for class I COs. We thus considered the hypothesis H0 that the foci in clusters are not subject to interference. The test was based on the distribution of distances between adjacent foci, specifically using the coefficient of variation for the statistical test and comparing to 105 simulations under H0 (see Materials and Methods). For the clusters of three or more foci (Table S2), we rejected the H0 hypothesis of no interference for MLH1 foci (p=0.0024 based on seven clusters), for HEI10 foci (p=0.0028 based on six clusters), and when pooling the MLH1 and HEI10 data (p=2.410-5 based on 13 clusters). Specifically, inside clusters, MLH1 and HEI10 foci are more evenly distributed than at random, showing that COs within clusters still interfere.. Taken together, these results show that the shortage in bivalent formation observed in axr1 mutants is not due to a general decrease in CO formation but rather to a mislocalisation of class I COs that tend to cluster together.. . . Measurement of Recombination Rates in axr1 Mutants. The level of genetic recombination on several chromosomal intervals was measured using the Fluorescent-Tagged Lines (FTL) tool developed by Copenhaver et al. [50]. The FTL system is a visual assay based on segregation of genetically linked fluorescent proteins expressed in the pollen grains of the quartet mutant (qrt1), in which the pollen grains remain attached as tetrads. With these lines, a large number of meiotic products can be visually scored and then a subset of multiple CO events can be identified (two-, three-, and four-strand double COs in adjacent intervals and four-strand double COs within a single interval) ([50] and Table S3B). Six different intervals were used, either on chromosome 3 (I3b and I3c) or 5 (I5a, I5b, I5c, and I5d), with sizes ranging from 1,200 to 4,900 kb (Table S3A).. We first measured recombination rates for each interval using the standard Perkins genetic mapping equation [51]. As shown in Table 1, recombination rates in axr1 vary differently depending on the interval tested, from 70% to 180% of the wild-type level. On average, axr1 shows an increase in recombination, but these data should be taken with caution, as recombination measurements rely only on a subset of tetrads (the viable tetrads). Out of the six intervals considered, intervals located close to the telomeres (I3b and I5b) showed the most significant increase in recombination, whereas proximal intervals appeared less affected. This could indicate that the level of recombination is affected differently according to the location on the chromosomes, although additional data will be required to determine if telomere proximity increases CO frequency in the mutant.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.t001.

[18], which compares the genetic length of one interval with and without the presence of a simultaneous event in the neighbouring interval. When the occurrence of a CO in one interval reduces the probability of a CO occurring in the adjacent interval, the IR is less than 1, indicating (positive) CO interference. When COs in the two adjacent intervals are independent of each other, the IR is 1, and if the presence of one CO in an interval increases the probability of an additional CO in the adjacent interval, the IR is greater than 1, indicating negative interference. As shown in Table 2, all wild-type IRs were less than 1, in agreement with the presence of CO interference. For axr1, however, all IRs increased dramatically and were statistically significantly different to wild type (p<0.0001, Table 2 and Table S4). In addition, all axr1 IR values were greater than 1, although only one pair of intervals tested was significantly different from 1 (I5a I5b, first data set, IR=1.63, p=410-3). Therefore, in axr1, adjacent COs appear to occur more frequently than in wild type, which is in agreement with the previously observed clustering of class I COs scored cytologically (Figure 7). The cytologically observed clustering is occurring at a very small scale, namely a few hundred kb (on average 1,200 kb for HEI10 foci and 800 kb for MLH1 foci, see above), whereas in FTLs pairs of intervals correspond to more than 3,000 kb (I5cd, I3bc) and up to 7,500 kb (I5ab). Consequently, most of the clusters are expected to be present within a single interval and to only occasionally affect two adjacent intervals, which could explain why only one pair of intervals showed significant negative interference.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.t002.

The IR compares the genetic size of the first interval when a CO occurs in the adjacent interval to the genetic size of the same interval when no CO occurs in the adjacent interval (Table S4A).. . . e. The p values indicate significant differences between axr1 IR and wild-type IR for a given pair of intervals.. . . f. The p values indicate significant differences between IR and 1.. . . . Double CO events within a single interval can be detected using the FTLs if the two COs involve four different chromatids (Table S3B) because they will generate nonparental ditype (NPD) tetrads [50]. Interference within single intervals can be estimated by comparing the observed number of double COs (NPD frequency) to the expected number of double COs under the hypothesis of no interference [52]. The ratio between these two numbers (NPDr) gives the strength of interference within the considered interval, even if an important proportion of multiple COs will be silent. We calculated NPDr for all intervals considered for wild type and axr1 (Table 1 and Table S5). In wild type, the NPDr indicated strong interference (NPDr close to 0.3) within all the intervals (except for I3c, which is too small for statistically meaningful data, Tables S3A and S5). In axr1, however, the NPDr increased systematically (between 0.7 and 1.47) and was mostly greater than 1. For two intervals (I5a and I5b), the NPDr values of 2.69 and 1.63 were statistically significant (p<0.01), showing negative interference (Table 2).. Thus, genetic analyses allowed us to measure negative interference in several of the intervals tested, confirming the CO clustering observed in cytology.. . . Recombination Initiation Is Not Modified in axr1 Mutants. To verify whether the recombination defect in axr1 could be linked to a defect in recombination initiation, we used two methods to investigate DSB formation. We first introgressed the axr1 mutation into a rad51 mutant, defective for meiotic DSB repair. In this mutant, DSBs are formed but are then repaired abnormally, leading to significant chromosomal defects (such as chromosome bridges and chromosome fragmentation) during anaphase I (Figure S5A). These chromosomal defects persisted in axr1rad51, showing that DSBs are present in the axr1 mutant (Figure S5B). Second, we analysed the nuclear distribution of the DMC1 protein, a meiosis-specific recombinase that forms foci at recombination sites. The dynamics and number of AtDMC1 foci in axr1 (23740, n=7) were indistinguishable from wild type (23489, n=28) (t, p=0.9) (Figure S5). Thus, the meiotic defects observed in axr1 are not correlated with a decrease in the amount of recombination initiation events.. . . Synapsis Is Strongly Defective in axr1 But Chromosome Axes Are Normal. During meiotic prophase, chromosomes are structured in the context of a protein axis (the AE), which is crucial for most meiotic events, including meiotic recombination and synapsis [53],[54]. The meiotic chromosome axis is composed of specific AE proteins, such as ASY1 and cohesion proteins (REC8 and SCC3, [55],[56]). In wild-type meiotic cells, cohesins are loaded as early as premeiotic G1, whereas ASY1 appears at leptotene first as foci, then as a linear signal throughout the entire chromosome length (Figure S6A), in a pattern similar to that of cohesins (Figure S6C, [56]). As shown in Figure S6, the signal observed in axr1 mutants cannot be differentiated from wild type, showing that no major alteration of the axis can be detected in axr1 mutants.. We then analysed the progression of synapsis by immunolocalisation of ZYP1, the A. thaliana CE component [57]. In wild type, ZYP1 appeared on chromosomes as foci that quickly elongated to yield a mixture of foci and short stretches of ZYP1 (Figure 8A,B, red signal and Figure S7). Synapsis then progressed until complete synapsis was reached, defining the pachytene stage (Figure 8C,D and Figure S7). In axr1, the early stages of synapsis could not be distinguished from wild type, showing a mix of foci and short ZYP1 stretches (Figure 8E,I and Figure S7). As meiosis progressed, ZYP1 elongation could be detected (Figure 8F-L and Figure S7), but full synapsis was never achieved (n=66), confirming the synapsis defect detected after DAPI staining of meiocyte spreads (Figure 3). In addition, in approximately half of the cells, ZYP1 signals appeared strongly perturbed, uneven in thickness and forming dotted lines rather than a homogeneous continuous signal (Figure 8J or G and Figure S7). In some cases, only short and thick ZYP1 stretches were detected. These could correspond to ZYP1 poly-complexes rather than to CE polymerisation (Figure 8L and Figure S7).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.g008. Figure 8. . Synapsis is strongly perturbed in axr1, but HEI10 dynamics during early prophase are unchanged.. ZYP1 and HEI10 proteins were co-immunolocalised on lipsol-spread chromosomes from wild-type (A-D) and axr1 (N877989 allele, E-L) meiotic cells. The overlay of both signals is shown here (ZYP1 in red, HEI10 in green), but single channels can be found in Figures S7 and S8. In wild type as in axr1, ZYP1 appears on chromosomes as foci that quickly elongate, yielding a mixture of foci and short stretches (A, B, E, F, and I). Synapsis then progresses until complete synapsis is reached in wild type, defining the pachytene stage (C-D). In axr1, ZYP1 elongation can be detected, but full synapsis was never achieved (G, H, and K). In axr1, the ZYP1 signal is often uneven in thickness or forms dotted lines rather than a homogeneous and continuous signal (J and G). In addition, in some cases, only short and thick ZYP1 stretches were detected which could correspond to ZYP1 polycomplexes (L). During early zygotene, in wild type as in axr1, HEI10 forms numerous foci of variable sizes on chromatin (A, E, and I). Then, although synapsis progresses, combinations of large and small foci are observed, forming strings of pearls on ZYP1 stretches (B, F, and J, arrows). As meiosis progresses, a few bigger and brighter HEI10 foci can be observed in wild type (D) and in axr1 (G, H, K, and L), which generally co-exist with smaller and fainter HEI1O foci (C, D, G, H, and K). Whereas this latter HEI10 pattern is associated with complete synapsis in wild type (C-D), synapsis is only partial in axr1 (G, H, K, and L). Bar=2 m.. . . . . . CO maturation and Synapsis Can Be Uncoupled in axr1. . To follow the progression of meiotic recombination events, we co-immunolocalised ZYP1 and HEI10, using a lipsol spreading protocol that has the advantage of allowing the simultaneous detection of these two proteins [58] but also the disadvantage of preventing examination of prophase after pachytene [59]. As mentioned above, HEI10 is detected as foci on meiotic chromosomes from leptotene to diakinesis, and its dynamics reflect the progression from early recombination intermediates to mature class I COs [48]. During leptotene and early zygotene, HEI10 forms numerous foci of variable size on chromatin (Figure 8A and Figure S8). Then, during synapsis initiation, bigger and brighter HEI10 foci appear, often co-localising with synapsed regions (Figure 8B and Figure S8). At this stage and later on, a combination of large and small foci are observed, forming strings of HEI10 pearls on ZYP1 stretches (Figure 8B,C and Figure S8B,C, arrows). At late pachytene, only a few bright HEI10 foci, corresponding to mature class I COs, are retained (Figure 8D and Figure S8). Nevertheless, during most of the pachytene stage, bright HEI10 foci are present, together with faint HEI10 signal marking the CE (Figure S8C,D). In axr1, the dynamics of HEI10 progression were the same as in wild type with HEI10 detected as multiple foci during early prophase stages (Figure 8E,I and Figure S8). Brighter foci then appeared as synapsis progressed, also forming a string of pearls on ZYP1 stretches (Figure 8J and Figure S8, arrows). A subset of very bright foci was retained at the later stages (Figure 8G,H,K,L and Figure S8). We noticed that at these late stages (based on the HEI10 pattern), the level of synapsis varied considerably from one cell to another. In addition, although these late HEI10 foci were always observed on ZYP1 stretches, the reverse was not true and ZYP1 stretches without late HEI10 signals were observed (see, for example, Figure 8H, where four late HEI10 foci are clustered on a single ZYP1 stretch, whereas many ZYP1 stretches are deprived of HEI10 foci). Therefore, it appears that class I CO clustering in axr1 is correlated with strong synapsis defects, but cannot be explained by the limited extension of the SC.. . . Meiotic Defects in the axr1 Mutant Are Epistatic to Those of a Cullin 4 Mutant. Because neddylation is known to regulate the activity of CRLs, we investigated whether axr1 meiotic defects are dependent on a specific CRL. In A. thaliana only four cullins are neddylated: cullin 1, cullin 3A, cullin 3B, and cullin 4 [33]. To identify possible AXR1 downstream players, we scored cullin-deficient lines for meiotic defects. Complete suppression of any of cullin functions (null cul1 or cul4 or the double cul3a cul3b mutants) is lethal, but various genetic backgrounds deficient in cullin activities are available. We first investigated meiosis of the auxin response defective cul1 mutant alleles-cul1-6. [60], axr6-2/N3818. [61], and axr6-3/eta1. [62]-and observed perfectly normal meiosis (not shown). Next, considering cullin 3 activity, we analysed the CUL3a/3b hypomorphic mutant [cul3w (cul3a3cul3b1)] described for its defects in various aspects of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway and root development [63]. cul3w plants also showed normal meiotic development of male meiocytes (not shown).. Finally, we analysed the cul4-1 mutant in which a T-DNA is inserted occurred in the 12th exon of the gene, leading to aberrant CUL4 mRNA expression, which varies depending on the developmental stage [64]. We observed significant male and female gametophyte abortion in cul4-1 (shown for the male, compare Figure 9A to Figure 2C). Although in wild type only balanced tetrads of microspores were observed, asymmetric tetrads and polyads were seen in cul4-1 mutants (compare Figure 9B to Figure 2E). Male meiosis was then investigated. The first stages of meiosis proceeded normally in cul4-1 mutants, however we observed metaphase I phenotypes reminiscent of the axr1 defects, with a large proportion of cells showing a clear reduction in bivalent formation (Figure 9C). The MCN per meiotic cell in cul4-1 (63.2, n=71) was significantly different from wild type (8.90.9, n=51, p<0.0001), and slightly different from axr1 (5.11.5, n=74, p=0.02). Nevertheless, the number of MCN per cell in cul4-1 was far more variable than in axr1 (Figure 9E), due to an overrepresentation of cells with wild-type levels of chiasmata (Figure 9D,E). We then introgressed the axr1 mutation (N877898) into cul4-1 and found that the double mutant cannot be distinguished from the single axr1 in terms of meiotic phenotype (not shown), the average level of MCN per cell (4.91.8, n=98, p=0.412), and in terms of variability of the values (Figure 9E), showing that axr1 is epistatic to cul4-1. Overall, our results suggest that AXR1 acts during meiotic recombination through the activation of a CRL4 complex.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001930.g009. Figure 9. . CULLIN4 is involved in meiotic recombination in the same pathway as axr1.. In the cul4-1 mutant, a mixture of viable (purple) and dead (arrow) pollen grains can be seen in the anthers after Alexander staining (A). This is correlated with the production of aberrant tetrads and polyads of microspores (B). DAPI staining of the meiotic chromosomes revealed a defect at metaphase I (C) in bivalent formation, which is quantified in (E). Bar = 10 M..
PMC3878973	Results. . Isolation of a putative TcNPR3 gene. Initially, a partial TcNPR3 gene was identified by screening a BAC library by hybridization with a partial TcNPR1 sequence. Based on this sequence, PCR primers were used to amplify cDNA isolated from cacao genotype Scavina6 (SCA6) stage C leaves. A fragment of 1764bp was isolated, cloned into pGEM vector and sequenced to reveal an intact coding sequence of the expected length and with high homology to the Arabidopsis NPR3 gene.. Subsequently, a genomic sequence containing a putative TcNPR3 gene was identified by searching a cacao genome database (http://cocoagendb.cirad.fr/) [36] using the full-length cacao NPR3 cDNA as a query for the Blastn algorithm [38]. The structure of the TcNPR3 gene (Tc06t011480) was deduced by comparing the full-length cDNA and genomic sequences using SPIDEY software tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/spidey/index.html) [49], which revealed the presence of four exons and three introns, similar to the genomic structure of Arabidopsis NPR3 (Figure1A).. . Figure 1. . Gene and protein structure of Theobroma cacao NPR3. A. Diagram of the TcNPR3 gene structure. Boxes with diagonal stripes represent exons, slanted lines represent introns. The sizes of the entire genomic fragment and each intron are indicated. B. Alignment of the Arabidopsis NPR3 and predicted TcNPR3 proteins. Amino acids blocked in black indicate identical residues in both sequences and the amino acids below the blocks represent the consensus sequence. BTB/POZ and ankyrin repeat domains are highlighted by dashed lines and solid line boxes, respectively.. . . . . . Arabidopsis and cacao NPR3 protein sequences are highly similar. Conceptual translation of the TcNPR3 predicted transcript resulted in a putative protein sequence consisting of 587 amino acid residues, only one amino acid longer than Arabidopsis NPR3. Alignment of the TcNPR3 and AtNPR3 protein sequences demonstrated that they are highly similar to each other (60% identity and 77% similarity). Arabidopsis and cacao NPR3 share key structural features (Figure1B). Both proteins have a BTB/POZ domain near their N-terminus (dashed line box) that shares 64% identity and an ankyrin repeat region (solid line box) which shares about 72% identity. It has been shown that both BTB/POZ domain and ankyrin repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions [50-53]. These similarities in protein structure suggested that TcNPR3 gene may also share the same function as AtNPR3 in the regulation of the defense response.. . . Expression of TcNPR3 in cacao tissues. RT-Q-PCR was performed to investigate the expression level of TcNPR3 in various cacao tissues, including leaves from sequential developmental stages A, C, E, representing young, mid and mature stages of development. In addition, RNA was isolated from open flowers, un-opened flowers, roots, seeds and fruit exocarp. TcNPR3 is constitutively expressed at varying levels, in all tissues tested (Figure2), similar to the Arabidopsis NPR3 gene [23]. TcNPR3 basal expression levels were relatively low in seed and moderate in floral tissues and young and mid-development leaves (stage A and C). Its expression was high in roots, exocarps and mature leaves (stage E).. . Figure 2. . Gene expression analysis of TcNPR3 in various cacao tissues. Total RNA samples were collected from open flower, un-opened flower, root, seed, exocarp and three different leaf developmental stages from youngest to oldest (A, C and E) with three biological replicates for each tissue. RT-Q-PCR was performed usingTcTUB1as a cDNA loading and normalization control. Expression levels are presented as the meansstandard errors of three biological replicates.. . . . . . TcNPR3 complements the Arabidopsis npr3-3 mutation. Our earlier work has shown that the Arabidopsis npr3 mutant phenotype includes a enhanced level of floral disease resistance and significantly reduced whole plant fitness [23]. To explore the function of TcNPR3, we introduced the cacao NPR3 CDS under the control of a constitutive promoter into Arabidopsis npr3-3 mutant transgenic plants, and tested its ability to complement the npr3 mutant phenotype.. As compared to WT Arabidopsis, which is highly susceptible to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (P.s.t.), floral infection resulting in shortened siliques and reduced seed production, the primary phenotype of Arabidopsis npr3-3 mutant is normal silique and seed development regardless of the inoculation of pathogen [23]. To test if TcNPR3 overexpression in the npr3-3 mutant can complement this phenotype, the floral infection assay was carried out with five individual TcNPR3 transgenic lines, Col-0 and npr3-3 mutant Arabidopsis plants. We inoculated young developing flowers with P.s.t and disease symptoms and bacterial growth were assayed. In water-treated inflorescences, we did not observe any phenotypic differences in any of the different lines (Figure3A). Seven days after inoculation, the P.s.t.-treated Col-0 plants were more susceptible than npr3-3 mutant plants, which showed impaired flower development and shorter siliques consistent with our previously reported results [23]. To evaluate the expression of the transgene, RT-PCR was performed using flowers of five independent transgenic lines along with wild-type Arabidopsis Col-0 and the npr3-3 mutant controls. As expected, TcNPR3 expression was not detected in either Col-0 or the npr3-3 mutant, but five independent transgenic lines all showed heterologous expression of TcNPR3 (Figure3C). All five individual transgenic lines exhibited intermediate levels of silique development after pathogen inoculation relative to Col-0 and npr3-3. To quantify these differences, the length of siliques of each infected inflorescence was measured in four biological replicates (Figure3B). The mean silique length of the npr3-3 mutant was 11mm regardless of the presence or absence of pathogen, but the silique length of infected Col-0 was significantly reduced to 1mm. All five independent transgenic npr3-3 lines overexpressing TcNPR3 exhibited intermediate silique lengths, ranging from 3mm to about 8mm. The inoculated silique length of line 1 is statistically the same as Col-0, but all the other lines are significantly longer than Col-0 but shorter than in npr3-3 mutant plants.. . Figure 3. .

Letters above the histogram indicate statistically significant differences among genotypes (P<0.05) determined by single factor ANOVA. C. Gene expression of TcNPR3 in transgenic Arabidopsis npr3-3 lines. RT-PCR was performed with cDNA prepared from flowers of 6-week-old plants of wild type (C), npr3-3 mutant (n) and five individual transgenic npr3-3 mutant overexpressing TcNPR3 (1-5). Arabidopsis ubiquitin (AtUbiquitin) was assayed as an internal and cDNA loading control.. . . . To further evaluate the effect of the TcNPR3 transgene in the complementation lines, we quantified bacterial titers in infected floral extracts. A decrease of bacterial colonization of about 60-fold was observed in the npr3-3 mutant as compared to Col-0 (Figure4). Although line 5 exhibited the same statistical level as npr3-3 mutant, two of the transgenic lines (Line 3 and 4) showed a level close to that of Col-0. The other two lines (line 1 and line 2) also supported significantly more bacteria than npr3-3 mutant though the level was not as high as in Col-0. In all, four out of five transgenic lines exhibited significantly higher bacteria levels than in npr3-3 mutant, again suggesting that TcNPR3 can at least partially complement npr3-3 mutant phenotype. The TcNPR3 protein only partially complemented the npr3 mutant, most likely because of the heterologous nature of the interactions between TcNPR3 and the Arabidopsis defense response machinery. It is also possible that TcNPR3 has functions that differ from those of AtNPR3. To gain further evidence to support these conclusions, we tested TcNPR3 function directly in T. cacao, using a transient expression system.. . Figure 4. .

Letters above the histogram indicate the statistical differences among different genotypes (P<0.05) determined by Fishers PLSD analysis. cfu, colony forming units.. . . . . . Knockdown of TcNPR3 in cacao leaves results in enhanced disease resistance. Our expression data revealed that TcNPR3 is expressed at moderate to high levels in leaves depending on developmental stage (Figure2). To test the function of TcNPR3 in cacao leaves, we knocked down its expression in cacao leaves by expressing an artificial microRNA via Agro-infiltration. We predicted that if NPR3 functions as a repressor of the NPR1-dependent defense response in cacao leaves, reduced NPR3 transcript would result in increased pathogen resistance proportional to the NPR3 expression level. To test this hypothesis, a 21nt inverted repeat-hairpin construct was created based the design of Arabidopsis Mir319 [45] which was placed under control of an enhanced CaMV35S promoter. The artificial TcNPR3 microRNA construct was expressed in cacao leaves by Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation via vacuum infiltration. Native NPR3 transcript levels were reduced up to 50% two days after transformation (Figure5A). To explore the effect of NPR3 expression on the ability of cacao leaves to respond and defend against pathogen infection, we inoculated the leaves with the cacao pathogen Phytophthora capsici. Three days after infection, lesions were formed in both control and NPR3-microRNA expressing leaf pieces (Figure5B). Average lesion sizes were significantly reduced to about one-half those on controls (Figure5C). To test the ability of pathogen to replicate on the leaves, we quantified the ratio of Phytophthora to cacao genomic DNA in the infection zones by RT-Q-PCR or specific target genes, which further demonstrated that the TcNPR3-mircoRNA transgene significantly reduced pathogenicity (Figure5D).. .

PMC2848764	Results. RAP2.1 possesses an APETALA2 (AP2) domain that binds to dehydration-responsive elements (DREs) and an ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, as the repression domain located at the C-terminus of the protein. Expression of RAP2.1 is strongly induced by drought and cold stress via an ABA-independent pathway. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing RAP2.1 show enhanced sensitivity to cold and drought stresses, while rap2.1-1 and rap2.1-2 T-DNA insertion alleles result in reduced sensitivity to these stresses. The reduced stress sensitivity of the plant containing the rap2.1 allele can be genetically complemented by the expression of RAP2.1, but not by the expression of EAR-motif-mutated RAP2.1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis has identified Responsive to desiccation/Cold-regulated (RD/COR) genes as downstream targets of RAP2.1 in vivo. Stress-induced expression of the RD/COR genes is repressed by overexpression of RAP2.1 and is increased in plants expressing the rap2.1 allele. In addition, RAP2.1 can negatively regulate its own expression by binding to DREs present in its own promoter. Our data suggest that RAP2.1 acts as a negative transcriptional regulator in defence responses to cold and drought stress in Arabidopsis..
PMC4489804	Results. . SPI Interacts with the P-body Component DCP1. Consistent with a role for BDCPs in membrane trafficking and dynamics, several studies identified membrane-associated proteins as binding partners of BDCPs [26-30]. To identify interactors of plant BDCPs, we performed yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screens using the C-terminal fragment of SPI containing its PBW domain module (referred to as SPI-PBW hereafter, Fig 1A) as bait. Surprisingly, we identified the evolutionarily conserved P-body core component DCP1 as an interaction partner (Fig 1B). All other tested decapping complex proteins including DCP2, DCP5, or VCS did not show interactions with SPI in yeast two-hybrid assays. The interaction of SPI-PBW and DCP1 was confirmed in pull-down experiments with bacterially expressed proteins. Gluthatione S-Transferase (GST)/His6-fusions of SPI-PBW were efficiently bound to resins labeled with Maltose Binding Protein (MBP)-tagged DCP1, while no binding was detected with the negative control MBP alone (Fig 1C). To analyze the interaction between full-length SPI and DCP1 in Arabidopsis leaf epidermis cells, we performed Frster-Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-Acceptor Photobleaching (AP) experiments (Fig 1D and 1E). We expressed YFP-tagged full-length genomic SPI (acceptor) and DCP1-CFP (cyan fluorescent protein; donor) under the 35S promoter and measured their FRET efficiencies (FRETE). We measured FRETE of about 27% in whole cells, indicating that the interaction between DCP1 and SPI occurs in vivo. To test whether the interaction takes place at P-bodies, we analyzed the fraction of immobile P-bodies [31]. Here, the FRETE was 23% (Fig 1E), indicating that SPI and DCP1 interact at P-bodies. No significant FRET was detected between DCP1-CFP and free YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) as a negative control. Donor emissions of cells transfected with DCP1-CFP alone were used as a photobleaching corrective (Fig 1D). The intracellular localization of the SPI-PBW/DCP1 interaction was independently analyzed by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) assays in transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermis cells. Like shown for full-length SPI and DCP1 in FRET-AP assays, we found SPI-PBW and DCP1 interacting at distinct cytoplasmic dot-like structures. These completely colocalized with DCP2-mCHERRY (mCHERRY is a monomeric mutant of DsRED) (Fig 2A). To exclude that the presence of another P-body component influences the interaction behavior of SPI-PBW and DCP1, we confirmed our observations in BiFC assays coexpressing free RFP (red fluorescent protein) instead of DCP2-mCHERRY (Fig 2B).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g001.

Bottom part: interaction between SPI-PBW, N-terminally fused to the GAL4 Binding Domain (BD), and DCP1 and other P-body core components fused to the GAL4 Activation Domain (AD), on selective dropout medium lacking leucine (-L), tryptophan (-W), and histidine (-H), supplemented with 5 mM 3-Aminotrizole (3AT). The Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), N-terminally fused to the GAL4-AD, has been included as negative control. (C) Coprecipitation of SPI-PBW-His6 with DCP1-MBP. Throughputs (TP), wash fractions (WF), and resin-bound MBP fusions (B) were detected by alpha-MBP (upper part) and alpha-His6 (lower part) antibody staining. GST-SPI-PBW-His6 (~110 kDa, arrowhead) coprecipitated with MBP-DCP1 (~ 83 kDa), but not with MBP (~42 kDa). Samples detected on different blots are separated by lines. (D) FRETE (in %) was measured in whole leaf epidermis cells (whole cells) and stationary P-bodies (PBs). YFP was bleached in whole cells (for details see Materials and Methods). Mean FRETEs for 35Spro:YFP-gSPI and 35Spro:DCP1-CFP (n = 11 cells) or 35Spro:YFP and 35Spro:DCP1-CFP (n = 10 cells) are shown. Error bars represent standard deviations for whole cells, and the standard deviation of the mean for PBs (n = 31 stationary PBs derived from whole cell samples). Two-tailed students t test was performed to compare FRETE between 35Spro:YFP-gSPI/35Spro:DCP1-CFP and 35Spro:YFP/35Spro:DCP1-CFP for each group (*** p < 0.001).

As negative controls, we coexpressed YFPC (C-terminal half of YFP)-DCP1 and YFPN (N-terminal half of YFP)-SPI-PBW with YFPN C-terminally fused to VPS20.2 (Vacuolar Sorting Protein 20.2) and YFPC N-terminally fused to AtMYC1 (MYC related protein 1), respectively (Fig 2C-2F; S1A and S1B Fig). We did not observe any YFP fluorescence, confirming the specificity of our BiFC analysis (S1 and S2 Tables). The integrity of VPS20.2-YFPN was confirmed in cells cotransfected with its known interactor VPS25 (Vacuolar Sorting Protein 25), C-terminally fused to YFPC (S1C Fig) [32,33]. The integrity of AtMYC-YFPC was confirmed by showing BiFC interaction with GL1 (GLABRA1), C-terminally fused to YFPN (S1D Fig) [34].. Taken together, these data show that Arabidopsis SPI interacts with DCP1 and that this interaction occurs at P-bodies.. . . Subcellular Localization of SPI. The finding that SPI-PBW interacts with DCP1 at P-bodies raised the question of where the SPI protein is localized. In contrast to our expectations from FRET and BiFC assays, we found 35S promoter-driven N-terminal YFP fusions with full-size genomic SPI (35Spro:gSPI) as well as SPI-PBW evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig 3A). In less than 10% of cells analyzed, YFP-gSPI accumulated in cytoplasmic dot-like structures (S1E Fig). We did not notice a correlation between the expression strength of YFP-gSPI and its localization behavior. In cells cotransfected with fluorescently tagged DCP1 and YFP-gSPI, YFP-gSPI was efficiently relocalized to P-bodies (84.8%, S1E and S1F Fig). This relocalization behavior suggests that DCP1 can recruit SPI to P-bodies. However, the functional role of DCP1 in the recruitment of SPI to P-bodies could not be analyzed, as dcp1 mutants are embryonic lethal [35].. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g003. Fig 3. . Colocalization studies with YFP-fusions of SPI (column I) and DCP2-mCHERRY-labeled P-bodies (column II) in transiently transfected Arabidopsis leaf epidermis cells.. Column III presents the overlay picture between columns I (green) and II (magenta). (A) Under nonstress conditions, YFP-gSPI (upper row) and YFP-SPI-PBW (lower row) are evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. (B) YFP-gSPI (upper row) and YFP-SPI-PBW (lower row) accumulate at DCP2-mCHERRY-labeled P-bodies after incubation of transfected leaves on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 140 mM NaCl for 10 h. Scale bar: 25 mum.. . . . . . SPI Localizes to P-bodies in a Salt Stress-Dependent Manner. As not only the accumulation frequency of the decapping complex but also the localization of various mRNA and protein constituents to P-bodies is highly stress-regulated [36-39], we reasoned that the association of SPI with P-bodies might be triggered by stress. Different abiotic stress conditions, including salt stress or hypoxia, are known to induce repression of de novo protein synthesis in Arabidopsis [40,41]. In turn, polysomes disassemble and release their transcripts, which are trapped by RNA binding proteins that frequently aggregate into cellular RNP particles such as P-bodies [42]. Consequently, P-bodies increase in number and size [24,38,43-45]. As P-body number increases under salt stress conditions in A. thaliana (Table 1), we tested whether salt treatments can induce the recruitment of SPI to P-bodies.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.t001. Table 1. . P-body number in leaf epidermis cells transiently expressing DCP1-mCHERRY.. Average numbers of P-bodies are provided for Col-0, spi-2 and spi-4 under nonstress (MS) and salt stress (MS supplemented with 140mM NaCl for 10 h) conditions.

In transiently transfected leaves, incubated on  Murashige and Skoog (MS) control medium or MS medium supplemented with different NaCl concentrations (S1G Fig), we observed a salt-dependent accumulation of YFP-gSPI in cytoplasmic dots that colocalized with the P-body marker DCP2-mCHERRY (Fig 3B). In contrast, Mannitol treatments had no effect on the localization of YFP-gSPI indicating that the relocalization of SPI is not triggered by osmotic stress in general (S1H Fig). The salt stress-dependent localization of SPI to P-bodies is likely mediated by its PBW module, as the corresponding fragment alone was sufficient for the localization to P-bodies (Fig 3A and 3B, second rows). Free YFP was never observed to accumulate in dots (S1I Fig).. In summary, these data show that the localization of SPI to P-bodies is triggered by salt stress but not by osmotic stress in general.. . . Salt Stress Induced P-body Formation Depends on SPI. P-body formation is determined by the relative entry and exit rates of mRNAs and mRNA binding proteins. The efficiency of material uptake and release from P-bodies can be monitored after blocking translation elongation with Cycloheximide (CHX), which causes the trapping of mRNAs in polysomes. As a consequence, the pool of translationally repressed mRNAs shrinks and the influx into P-bodies decreases, resulting in a reduced number of P-bodies [14,24,44-46]. In stably transformed 35S:DCP1-YFP Col-0 plants, the number of P-bodies was reduced by 50%, 45 min after CHX treatment (Fig 4A and 4B). The reduction of P-body numbers was not significantly different in two different spi mutant alleles (S2A and S2B Fig), indicating that uptake and release from P-bodies are not generally affected in spi mutants under nonstress conditions. Mock treated cells did not show any significant changes in P-body numbers (S2C Fig). We confirmed the response of P-bodies to CHX treatments in leaf epidermis cells of Col-0, spi-2, and spi-4 transiently transfected with another P-body marker, 35Spro:DCP2-mCHERRY (S2D Fig).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g004. Fig 4. . Blocking translation leads to a reduction of P-body number.. Changes of P-body number were analyzed in whole leaf areas of transgenic plants expressing DCP1-YFP. (A) Whole leaf areas are presented before (0 min) and after continuous CHX treatments (45 min and 90 min). Scale bar: 50 mum. (B) Reduction of P-body number (in %) relative to untreated samples (time point 0) determined 45 min and 90 min after CHX treatment. Data denote the average from seven biological replicates. SD values represent standard deviations. No statistical differences were found between wild-type and spi mutants (Two-tailed students t test).. . . . To test whether the DCP1-dependent recruitment of SPI requires the bulk RNA flow from polysomes to P-bodies, we exposed transiently transfected cells to 0.5 mM CHX for 150 min. Under these conditions, YFP-gSPI still accumulated in DCP1-mCHERRY labeled P-bodies (S1G and S2E Figs).. In a second step, we examined P-body assembly under salt stress conditions in two spi alleles. In contrast to wild-type, both spi mutants showed no significant changes in P-body number (Table 1). In samples treated simultaneously with CHX (0.5 mM) and NaCl (140 mM) for 90 min, the number of P-bodies decreased significantly by 20% in both Col-0 and spi mutants (S2F Fig). This indicates that in Col-0, the salt stress-induced increase of P-body number depends on the RNA flow from polysomes to P-bodies. In addition, the data show that in spi mutants P-body maintenance depends on polysome-P-body RNA shuttling also under salt stress conditions.. Taken together, our data suggest that SPI is functionally important for the accumulation of mRNA-protein complexes in P-bodies under salt stress conditions.. . . . spi Mutants Display Salt Hypersensitivity. The salt stress-dependent function of SPI at P-bodies suggested that SPI might be relevant for the salt stress tolerance of Arabidopsis. We first compared root growth efficiencies between Col-0 and three spi mutant alleles at different NaCl concentrations under nontranspiring conditions. The relative growth of primary roots did not differ between wild-type and spi under nonstress conditions. With increasing NaCl concentrations, we observed a stronger inhibition of primary root growth in spi than in Col-0 (Fig 5A). The stress hypersensitive phenotype of spi mutants is salt specific, as the relative root growth of spi and Col-0 did not significantly differ after Mannitol treatments (Fig 5B). The notion that spi mutants are salt hypersensitive was supported by cotyledon greening assays. While cotyledon greening of spi mutants was undistinguishable from Col-0 plants under nonstress conditions, a clear whitening of more than 50% of spi seedlings was observed on MS medium supplemented with 150 mM NaCl after an incubation time of 14 d. More than 90% of Col-0 plants remained unaffected under these conditions (Fig 5C). Next, we assessed the salt sensitivity of more adult plants under transpiring conditions in NaCl irrigation experiments (Fig 5D and 5E). When treated with 50 mM or 100 mM NaCl, growth of spi mutants was much more restricted than growth of wild type plants.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g005. Fig 5. . . spi mutants display salt hypersensitivity..

Data in (A) and (B) were normalized to nonstress conditions and denote the average from three independent biological replicates (n = 12 seedlings each). Error bars represent standard deviations. Two-tailed students t tests were performed to compare spi alleles and Col-0 exposed to the same conditions (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).

(D) Diameter of leaf rosettes (in cm) of 32-day-old plants, measured after irrigation with MS only (control) or MS supplemented with increasing NaCl concentrations on every second day (two times MS + 50 mM NaCl and two times MS +100 mM NaCl).

(E) Representative images of 30-d-old Col-0 and spi-2 plants grown under nonstress (MS) and salt stress conditions (irrigation two times with MS + 50 mM NaCl and one time with MS + 100 mM NaCl in alternation with MS every second day) on a sand-soil mixture. Scale bar: 1.5 cm.. . . . In summary, these data show that SPI is required for Arabidopsis salt stress but not for osmotic stress tolerance in general.. . . The Loss of SPI Leads to Pleiotropic Transcriptional Changes. To test whether the hypersensitive response of spi mutants is accompanied by changes in the transcript levels, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the transcriptome by RNAseq of wild type and spi mutants under control and salt stress conditions. 10-d-old seedlings were incubated in liquid MS control medium or MS medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl for 4 h. Ten libraries were Illumina-sequenced, mapped, and the results were visualized (for additional information see S1 Text, S3-S8 Figs, and S3 Table; complete raw data are available under http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/278120). Between spi mutant and wild type, 483 (control condition) and 474 transcripts (salt-treated condition) were significantly different between genotypes (q < 0.01, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) corrected). The salt treatment significantly altered the abundance of 8,469 transcripts in Col-0 and 8,482 transcripts in the spi mutant (Table 2).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.t002. Table 2. .

In Col-0, the salt treatment altered transcriptional abundance in stress-related gene categories (Fig 6A and 6B). At the same time, transcript abundance in categories related to growth was changed (S5 and S6 Figs). This transcript abundance pattern reflected the cross activation of different stress pathways, the preparation for reduced nutrient uptake with regard to nitrate and iron, and, likely as a consequence, a down-regulation of photosynthesis (Fig 6A). In spi, the salt treatment altered transcriptional abundance in similar gene categories, including the main abiotic responses, biotic responses, and metabolic Gene Ontology (GO) term categories (Fig 6C and 6D, S7-S9 Figs). The gene-by-gene comparison of the transcriptional abundance changes in Col-0, and spi showed that one-fourth of the responses are specific to each genotype and three-fourths are shared (Fig 6E). In the shared response, the strength of regulation was similar between Col-0 and spi, indicating that the response to salt stress is not attenuated but qualitatively changed (S7-S9 Figs). As the biological relevance for the salt stress response has not been validated for most of the differentially regulated genes yet, we directly compared the expression levels of a subset of genes, functionally and/or genetically shown to regulate Arabidopsis salt stress response [47-53]. While most of the candidate genes tested were significantly up-regulated under salt stress conditions in Col-0 as well as in spi mutants, a subset of genes was either not up-regulated or significantly less up-regulated in spi mutants (S4 Table).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g006. Fig 6. . Transcriptome-wide analysis.. (A) Mapman visualization of log2-fold changes in Col-0 upon salt treatment and (B) the corresponding 25 most strongly enriched GO terms.

(E) Venn diagram comparing the salt stress-dependent up-regulation of transcripts in Col-0 (wt) and spi (see also S8 Table).. . . . Our RNA-Seq analysis demonstrated that SPI affects transcripts abundance pleiotropically in a global manner rather than specifically salt stress-regulated mRNAs. Among the latter, only a subset of transcripts was identified to be differentially regulated by SPI.. . . Transcripts Are Destabilized under Salt-Stress Conditions in spi. . Since the steady-state transcript levels provide only a snapshot of the balance between transcription and mRNA decay, we determined the stabilities of SPI-dependent (TANDEM ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 3 (TZF3) and ABA INSENSITIVE 1 (ABI1)) and SPI-independent regulated mRNAs (RESPONSIVE TO DESSICATION 29B (RD28B) and CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 9 (CIPK9)) (S4 Table). Towards this end, we measured transcript levels by qPCR under nonstress and salt stress conditions 3 h and 6 h after inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D (ActD) [54,55]. Under nonstress conditions, the mRNA decay rates of RD29B and TZF3 were similar in wild type and spi mutants (Fig 7A and 7B), while ABI1 and CIPK9 transcripts were significantly stabilized in all three spi alleles (Fig 7C and 7D).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g007. Fig 7. . mRNA decay is not accelerated in spi mutants under nonstress conditions.. mRNA stabilities (in %) were determined 3 h and 6 h after application of Actinomycin D (ActD), relative to time point 0 under nonstress conditions for RD29B (A), TZF3 (B), CIPK9 (C), and ABI1 (D). Data denote the average from three independent biological and two technical replicates. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Two-tailed students t tests were performed to compare 18S rRNA normalized expression levels either of spi alleles with that of wild-type (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 of all spi alleles), or of ActD-treated samples with that of untreated samples (time point 0) ( p < 0.05; . p < 0.01 of all treated samples).. . . . The incubation of seedlings in MS liquid medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl for 4 h resulted in a stabilization of RD29B in wild type. In contrast, RD29B mRNA decay was enhanced in spi mutants under these conditions (compare Figs 7A and 8A). Similarly, TZF3 was slightly stabilized under salt stress conditions in wild type (compare Figs 7B and 8B), whereas it was significantly destabilized in the absence of SPI (Fig 8B). CIPK9 and ABI1 mRNA stability was not significantly different in wild type and spi mutants (Fig 8C and 8D).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g008. Fig 8. . Role of SPI in the regulation of mRNA stability.. mRNA stabilities (in %) were determined 3 h and 6 h after application of Actinomycin D (ActD) relative to time point 0 under salt stress conditions (200 mM NaCl in MS liquid medium for 4 h). mRNA decay was determined for RD29B (A), TZF3 (B), CIPK9 (C), and ABI1 (D). Data denote the average from three independent biological and two technical replicates. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Two-tailed students t tests were performed to compare 18S rRNA normalized expression levels either of spi alleles with that of wild-type (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 of all spi alleles), or of ActD-treated samples with that of untreated samples (time point 0) ( p < 0.05; . p < 0.01 of all treated samples).. . . . Given that in spi mutants some mRNAs are stabilized under control conditions (CIPK9, ABI1) whereas others are destabilized under salt stress conditions (RD29B, TZF3), it is conceivable that SPI does not regulate RNA stability directly but rather the uptake into P-bodies where each mRNA experiences its specific fate.. . . SPI Regulates the Localization of Its mRNA Targets. The salt stress-dependent recruitment of SPI to P-bodies suggested to us that SPI might regulate the localization of mRNAs. As salt-regulated transcripts were selectively destabilized under salt stress conditions in spi mutants, we tested whether their spatial and temporal distributions were also impaired. We monitored the localization of two different mRNA targets of SPI in vivo using the LambdaN22 reporter system [56]. We placed 16 BoxB repeats N-terminally to the 5 UTR of full-size genomic TZF3 (gTZF3) and RD29B (gRD29B), and coexpressed them with the LambdaN22 protein fused to mVENUS in Arabidopsis leaf epidermis cells. Binding of LambdaN22-mVENUS to the BoxB repeats enables the indirect visualization of the RNAs of interest. Three different negative control experiments were performed: first, the LambdaN22-mVENUS reporter was coexpressed with the BoxB repeats without the mRNA target (S10A Fig). Second, the full-size genomic target constructs without the stem loops but with an N-terminally fused mCHERRY were coexpressed with the reporter construct (S10B and S10C Fig). Third, the LambdaN22-mVENUS reporter was coexpressed with full-size genomic ABF3 (gABF3), a transcript unaffected in its stability in spi mutants under all conditions investigated (S10D-S10F Fig). Under all three control conditions, the LambdaN22-mVENUS reporter was detected almost exclusively in the nucleus or in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.. In cells coexpressing 16BoxB-gTZF3 or 16BoxB-gRD29, we observed accumulations of the reporter constructs in cytoplasmic dot-like structures, indicating that these accumulations are caused by the presence of the 16BoxB-fused target mRNAs (S11A and S11B Fig). Colocalization studies with DCP1, C-terminally fused to mCHERRY, revealed that several mRNA positive accumulations overlap with P-bodies (Fig 9). As P-body and mRNA granule formation follow the principles of classical liquid-liquid phase separations, comprising multivalent and low affinity interactions between proteins constituents and mRNA substrates involved [57-59], their assembly is highly dynamic. As a consequence, the number of mRNA granules and their size is highly variable from cell to cell [39,46,60,61]. This was also observed in our study; however, a quantitative analysis revealed clear differences between nontreated and salt stress-treated samples. In transfected Col-0 cells, 33% of RD29B and 52% of TZF3 positive dots colocalized with P-bodies under nonstress conditions. Their amount in cells treated with 140mM NaCl increased to 57% and 81%, respectively (Table 3).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g009.

This salt stress-dependent recruitment of RD29B and TZF3 to P-bodies was not observed after CHX treatments suggesting that these two mRNAs are delivered from the polysomes to the P-bodies (S11C and S11D Fig).

The average number of TZF3 mRNA dots per cell was unchanged under salt stress conditions in comparison to nonstress conditions (Table 4). In two spi alleles, we observed an impaired granule formation behavior for the transcripts of TZF3 and RD29B in two respects. First, no salt stress-dependent relocalization of TZF3 and RD29B mRNA dots to P-bodies took place (Table 3). Second, the total number of RD29B mRNA dots was not increased like in Col-0 cells (Table 4).. Our RNA localization data show that SPI functions as a positive regulator of post-transcriptional RNP particle formation under salt stress conditions.. . . The Interaction between BDCPs and P-bodies Is Evolutionarily Conserved. BDCPs and the Decapping machinery are evolutionarily highly conserved and are present in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. In inter- and intraspecific interaction studies, we also investigated whether an association between BDCPs and P-bodies is evolutionarily conserved. In yeast two-hybrid assays and coprecipitation experiments, we observed the interspecific interactions between the Arabidopsis SPI-PBW and both mammalian DCP1 isoforms (DCP1a and DCP1b) as well as its yeast counterpart (DCP1p) (Fig 10A and 10B). The interaction to the yeast DCP1p was especially surprising, as its protein structure differs strongly from those of mammalian and plant homologs (S12 Fig). In contrast to human and Arabidopsis DCP1 proteins, yeast DCP1p lacks an extended C-terminal domain. In the remaining N-terminal region, we found only one domain, the EVH1 (Enabled/VASP Homology 1 Domain) domain that is conserved in all four DCP1 proteins suggesting that this domain mediates the DCP1 BDCP interactions.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g010.

To substantiate our hypothesis of an evolutionarily conserved association of BDCPs and the Decapping machinery, we studied the interactions of the PH-BEACH domain containing fragment of the human FAN (Factor Associated with Neutral sphingomyelinase activation) protein with the corresponding human DCP1 isoforms and the Arabidopsis DCP1 homolog. Interactions were found in yeast two-hybrid assays and coprecipitation experiments (Fig 11A and 11B). As we used a C-terminal truncation of FAN lacking its WD40 repeats, we exclude that this protein region is required for an interaction to DCP1. Furthermore, sequence alignments revealed that the eponymous BEACH domain exhibits the highest level of sequence conservation in the C-terminal fragments of SPI and FAN (S13 Fig).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188.g011.

All together our data on intra- and interspecific interactions between Arabidopsis SPI, human FAN, and the DCP1 homologs from Arabidopsis, human, and yeast demonstrate that the association of BDCPs and P-bodies is not plant specific but rather evolutionarily conserved..
PMC3090399	Results. . EST sequencing of Hpa-infected Arabidopsis tissue. Hpa isolates Emoy2, Emwa1, Noco2 and Waco9 were assessed for growth on the Arabidopsis enhanced disease susceptibility 1 mutant Ws eds1-1 [40]. Microscopic analysis of infected leaves after trypan blue staining revealed the extent of pathogen growth. A higher level of colonization of Arabidopsis leaves, with abundant hyphal growth and haustoria projections formed in adjacent plant cells, was observed for Hpa isolate Waco9 compared to Emoy2 (Fig. S1) and other isolates tested (results not shown). Waco9-infected leaves harvested at 5 dpi (before sporulation) (Fig.1A) were therefore used for the construction of a cDNA library.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.g001. Figure 1. . Hpa isolateWaco9-infected Arabidopsis seedlings used for cDNA library construction.. (A) Trypan blue staining of infected Arabidopsis leaves (Ws eds1-1) showing extensive hyphal growth in the absence of asexual sporulation at 5 dpi. (B) Bioanalyzer profile of total RNA obtained from Hpa Waco9-infected leaf material. The 28S rRNA peaks of Arabidopsis (At) and Waco9 (Hpa) are indicated.. . . . Total RNA isolated from the Waco9-infected material revealed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) peaks of Hpa and Arabidopsis (Fig. 1B). The observed peaks were validated as rRNA originating from Hpa or Arabidopsis by comparing profiles of infected leaves with those of RNA from Hpa conidiospores mixed in different proportions with Arabidopsis leaf RNA (Fig. S2). This analysis showed that 50% of RNA extracted from the Waco9-infected leaves was derived from Hpa. Poly (A+) RNA was isolated from the infected leaf total RNA preparations and size-fractionated cDNAs ranging from 500 to 5000 bp were used for cDNA library construction.. 7680 sequencing reactions corresponding to the 5 end of the cDNAs were performed. After vector trimming and removal of low quality sequences and chimeras, 6364 ESTs remained ranging in length from 50 to 1000 nucleotides (nt). The majority (84%; 5321 sequences) of ESTs had a read length of more than 500 nt (Fig. 2A). Assembly of ESTs yielded a total of 3729 unique sequences (unigenes) consisting of 2810 (75%) singletons and 919 (25%) contigs with two or more ESTs (Fig. 2B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.g002. Figure 2. . ESTs and unigenes derived from Hpa Waco9 infections.. (A) Size distribution of the 6364 ESTs (in nucleotides). (B) Distribution of 3729 unique sequences based on the number of assembled ESTs. (C) Distribution of 6364 ESTs and 3729 unigenes based on sequence origin. Numbers of sequences with significant similarity to Arabidopsis, Hpa, other oomycetes, other organisms and unknown, are indicated.. . . . To define the origin of the unigene sequences, BLASTN searches were performed against the genome sequences of Arabidopsis, Hpa, three oomycete pathogens (P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum) and the NCBI nr nucleotide database. Almost all unigenes (3722; 99.8%) showed significant similarity (E<10-5) to known sequences. Whereas 1556 unigenes (42%, corresponding to 2253 ESTs) were identified as Arabidopsis sequences, 2164 unigenes (58%; 4102 ESTs) had homologues within the sequenced Hpa isolate Emoy2 (Fig. 2C). Of the remaining unigenes two had high identity scores with sequences of other non-plant and non-oomycete organisms and seven did not show significant homology to any sequence in the databases (unknown sequences in Fig. 2C), nor contained a signal peptide in the predicted open reading frame and were therefore not further analyzed. Altogether, we defined 2164 unigenes as Hpa-derived to use them for subsequently functional classification.. . . Identification of putative secreted Hpa proteins. Secreted proteins of fungal and oomycete plant pathogens have been shown to function as pathogenicity factors [4], [41], [42]. We therefore performed a comprehensive search for Hpa transcripts encoding secreted proteins. From the 2164 Hpa unigenes a set of 198 unigenes (822 ESTs, 9.15% of unigenes) encoded proteins with a predicted signal peptide as analyzed with SignalP software [43], [44], and without putative transmembrane domains. The EST-derived unigenes are significantly enriched (p=4e-6) for transcripts encoding predicted secreted proteins when compared to the genome wide percentage of 6.8% (Table S2).. To define which of the Hpa secreted proteins are shared with other organisms, the 198 unigenes were compared to the genome sequences of three oomycete pathogens (Phytophthora infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum) and sequences in GenBank, excluding Hpa. Significant blast hits (E<10-5 and sequence coverage >75%) were obtained for 123 unigenes (Fig. 3). The remaining 75 sequences (38%) did not have a significant hit with other oomycetes or non-Hpa sequences in GenBank, suggesting that these genes are Hpa-specific. As the Hpa genome sequence is derived from isolate Emoy2 [25] and the ESTs isolated here are from isolate Waco9, we searched for possible differences between these two isolates. The 75 Hpa-specific unigenes were queried against the assembled Emoy2 genome sequence and manually compared to Hpa trace files (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) to search for sequences that might be missing from the Hpa genome assembly. No significant hits were obtained for six sequences, suggesting that these unigenes are present in Hpa isolate Waco9 but not in Emoy2.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.g003. Figure 3. . Scheme showing categorization of Hpa Waco9 unigenes encoding predicted secreted proteins.. Sequences with homologues in oomycetes (excluding Hpa) and other organisms are grouped (123 sequences). The remaining 75 unigenes were used to search for homologues in the assembled Emoy2 genome and trace files. A set of six unigenes with no significant similarity to any other sequence is defined as Waco9-specific.. . . . A functional annotation of the 198 Hpa unigenes predicted to encode secreted proteins was performed by comparison to the Pfam database of protein domains [45] and by manual annotation to search for specific classes of effectors. No function could be defined for 108 sequences that were therefore classified as unknowns. Table S3 shows the putative functions or domains assigned to 90 unigene-encoded proteins. A selection of categories potentially associated with pathogenicity (adapted from [23]), and the number of ESTs and unigenes belonging to each group, is shown in Table 1. Unigenes encoding putative pathogenicity proteins (58 sequences) were classified into three categories: hydrolase enzymes, protection against oxidative stress, and effectors. These 58 unigenes, together with the 108 sequences with unknown function, were then divided according to the group of organisms in which homologues were identified. From the 108 unknown sequences, 51 are categorized as Hpa-specific (Table 1). Homologues in other oomycetes were identified for all unigenes predicted to function as hydrolases or in protection against oxidative stress (Table 1), indicating that proteins in these classes are conserved among oomycetes. We looked for various families of effectors that are associated with the triggering or manipulation of host cell defenses [46], [47], [48]. Putative effector proteins formed the largest functional group identified, comprising 42 unigenes. In this category we assigned 16 proteins as Cysteine-rich (CR) proteins and 18 as belonging to the RXLR family. The majority of both effector types (23 out of 34 unigenes) appear to be Hpa-specific since no related sequences were detected in other oomycetes. Moreover, two CR proteins and four RXLRs were not identified in the Emoy2 genome suggesting they are isolate Waco9-specific. Other classes of predicted effector proteins such as Necrosis-inducing like proteins, elicitins, Crinklers and cyclophilin had homologues within other oomycetes, suggesting that these sequences belong to a common core of putative effectors present in oomycete organisms. The Crinkler identified carries a variation of the LxLFLAK translocation motif (Fig. S3), which has also been described to be present in several Crinklers of P. infestans (Haas et al 2009).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.t001.

The distribution in different pathogenicity categories and organisms in which homologues were identified are shown. Functional classification is based on Pfam searches and manual annotation.. . . . *1 One predicted Cysteine-rich candidate has homology to Tetrahymena thermophila and to Hpa sequences. No homologue was found in other oomycetes.. . . . *2 Elicitin HaELL2 is classified as Hpa-specific due to its extended specific C-terminal domain.. . . . . . Elicitin signatures in Hpa. Elicitins (ELIs) are extracellular effectors characterized by a 98 amino acid conserved domain with a core of six cysteines in a specific spacing pattern allowing their classification into different groups. Elicitin-like proteins (ELLs) have more variation in the size and sequence of their elicitin domains [49]. Although Pfam searches identified four ELL unigenes in Waco9 (Table 1), only three of these sequences were further analyzed (Fig. 4) since the fourth contained only five cysteines and therefore did not classify as an ELI/ELL. The HaELL1, 2 and 3 encoded proteins have fewer than 5% cysteine residues and are classified as alpha-elicitins due to their acidic pI [50]. The different size and cysteine spacing in the elicitin domain of these three HaELLs is shown in Fig. 4. While HaELL2 resembles Phytophthora ELL-1 proteins [49], the Cys pattern in HaELL1 and 3 appears to be specific for Hpa. All three proteins have an extended C-terminal region following the elicitin domain, a feature of other oomycete ELLs [49]. This region is smaller in HaELL1 and 3 (57 and 53 amino acids, respectively) in comparison to HaELL2 (137 amino acids). The C-terminal domain appears to have a biased amino acid composition as it is rich in threonine, alanine and serine (Fig. 4). The high abundance of threonine and serine residues in the C-terminal part of HaELL1, 2 and 3 points to numerous potential sites for O-glycosylation (predicted by NetOGlyc 3.1) that could link the proteins to the cell wall. A hydrophobic region containing a GPI anchor was predicted in the C-terminal part of HaELL2, suggesting that this protein might be anchored to the plasma membrane. O-glycosylation sites and GPI anchor regions have been described for other Phytophthora ELIs/ELLs [49].. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.g004. Figure 4. . Schematic representation of protein domains of three identified Hpa HaELLs.. The predicted signal peptide is shown in black. A region between the signal peptide and the elicitin domain found in HaELL2 and 3, with respectively 23 and 8 amino acids, is shown (N). The pattern of cysteine spacing and the size of the elicitin domain are depicted. The percentage of highly abundant amino acid residues in the C-terminus is: HaELL1: T: 14%, A: 12%, S: 7%; HaELL2: T: 28%, A: 13%, S: 10% per domain is depicted. The C-terminus of HaELL3 is divided into two regions (C1 and C2). C1: S: 51%, T: 19%; C2: D;56%, E:31%.. . . . . . Hpa derived Cysteine-rich (CR) proteins. A number of CR proteins secreted by fungal pathogens have been shown to be recognized by R proteins in resistant host plants [51], [52], [53]. The cysteines in these proteins form disulphide bridges that contribute to their structural stability in the plant apoplast, an environment rich in proteases. To identify HaCR candidates among the putative Hpa secreted proteins, we determined the relative number of cysteine residues in the full-length translated sequences. A total of 16 HaCR proteins were identified which contain more than 5% cysteines and range in size from 72 to 405 amino acids (Table 2). Nine of the HaCR candidates could be placed into two groups based on the pattern and spacing of the cysteines (Fig. 5). The cysteine motif in group I and II is repeated one or more times in most group members. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, six HaCR candidates have homologues in other oomycete pathogens. Candidates from Groups I and II do not have an obvious oomycete counterpart. However for HaCR2 significant homology (blast E value <1e-5) was found to a protein of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.g005. Figure 5. .

Oomycetes: significant blast hits obtained only with oomycete sequences; Hpa-specific: blast hits obtained only with the Emoy2 genome. If no significant blast hit was obtained with Emoy2 or any other organism, then the sequence is defined as a Waco9.. . . . Notably, the HaCR sequences comprised the largest number of ESTs among the selected pathogenicity factors (Table 1), indicating that this class of effectors is highly expressed during infection. Blast searches against the Emoy2 genome identified homologues of the Waco9 HaCRs (Table 2). Six proteins (HaCR4, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15) were absolutely conserved (100% identity) between the two isolates. The most divergent protein (HaCR7) had 89% identity between isolates Waco9 and Emoy2. No Emoy2 homologues were found for HaCR6 and HaCR16, the latter being a homologue of the previously described Ppat23 protein of isolate Maks9 [39]. HaCR1, represented by the highest number of ESTs (84) among the secreted proteins, is a homologue of Ppat14 from Hpa isolate Maks9 [39].. . . Classification of host-translocated Hpa RXLR proteins. RXLR proteins comprise a class of oomycete effectors that are translocated into the plant cell [36]. All known oomycete effector proteins that are recognized by specific plant R proteins belong to this class [11], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. The Hpa unigenes encoding putative secreted proteins were therefore mined for candidate RXLR effectors. Proteins containing either an RXLR or RXLQ/RXLG motif in the mature protein were selected. Variations in the last arginine of the RXLR still allows protein translocation into the host cell [37]. We identified 18 RXLR candidates (including one RXLQ containing protein) encoding relatively small proteins ranging from 115 to 340 amino acids (Table 3). The distance between the RXLR/Q motif and the signal peptide cleavage site varied from 15 to 51 amino acids indicating that the RXLR/Q motif is near the N-terminus. The presence of an acidic region (EER) downstream of the RXLR motif was identified in eight RXLR candidates (Table 3) and two (RXLR3 and RXLR6) have a putative nuclear localization signal as predicted by Psort.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.t003.

From the 18 RXLR sequences identified here, only four proteins have homology with other oomycetes, indicating that the majority of the RXLR candidates are Hpa-specific (Tables 1 and 3). Among these four RXLR proteins, RXLR5 and 18 showed a high degree of similarity with homologues in P. infestans (75% and 72% identity, respectively, with 100% sequence coverage). From the 14 Hpa-specific proteins, blast searches revealed that 10 RXLRs have corresponding genes in Emoy2 (Tables 1 and 3). Further analysis of these sequences revealed that RXLR29 is represented by a null allele in Hpa Emoy2 caused by a frame-shift mutation resulting in a premature stop codon (Fig. S4). For RXLR4, 12, 16 and 22 no significant blast hits with the Emoy2 genome sequence were obtained (Tables 1 and 3). It is possible that these RXLR genes are either highly polymorphic or absent from the Emoy2 genome.. . . Allelic diversity of RXLR effector candidate genes. Coding sequences of the 18 RXLR candidate effectors were deduced from seven Hpa isolates. Table 4 shows the number of protein variants found for each RXLR and their distribution among the different Hpa isolates. For example, RXLR3 is represented by two allelic forms: Waco9, Noks1, Emco5 and Cala2 share variant A, Emoy2 and Maks9 carry protein variant B and Hind2 has no RXLR3 gene. Heterozygosity was also observed for some RXLRs (e.g. RXLR6 in Cala2 contains both protein variants A and B). RXLR5 was the least variable gene with identical proteins in all seven Hpa isolates.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.t004. Table 4. .

The letters indicate protein variants present at each isolate (protein level). When 2 letters are present it means that the Hpa isolate is heterozygous for that locus and has one copy of each allele.. . . . (-) indicates that no allele was obtained.. . . . No allele sequences were amplified for RXLR12 and 22 in Emoy2 or in any of the five other Hpa isolates, indicating that these are Waco9-specific. RXLR4 was only amplified from isolates Hind2 and Waco9. Although blast searches did not reveal a significant hit for RXLR16 in the Emoy2 genome (Table 3), allele sequences were obtained for Emoy2 as well as the other isolates. Due to a high level of polymorphism between the RXLR16 protein sequences in Waco9 and Emoy2, the blast hit obtained was excluded based on cut-off values.. The RXLR29 gene was of particular interest because Waco9 is the only isolate of these analyzed that contains an intact full-length ORF. In the remaining six Hpa isolates, RXLR29 displayed insertions/deletions giving rise to frame shifts resulting in null alleles (Fig. S4). In Maks9 we also found two different truncated versions of RXLR29. These results show that a functional RXLR29 protein is only present in Waco9 suggesting that it has been counter-selected in the other Hpa isolates examined.. Of the 13 RXLR candidate effectors with at least two different protein variants, we defined the percentage of variable sites within the protein sequences (Fig. 6). RXLR9, 13, 16, 19 and 23 are the most polymorphic effector proteins with more than 10% variable sites among the isolates sequenced. The ratio of >1 non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions [54] in RXLR 9, 13, 16, 19 and 23 suggests that these genes are under positive selection to maintain amino acid diversity (Table 5).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.g006.

Since only isolate Waco9 appears to have retained a functional RXLR29 protein, we selected this gene to determine a potential effector activity. We used a bacterial effector delivery vector (EDV) system which was previously shown to successfully deliver the Hpa effector ATR13 to Arabidopsis leaf cells by fusion to the N-terminal portion of a TTSS bacterial effector [42]. RXLR29 was cloned in the EDV system and expressed in the Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) DC3000deltaCEL mutant strain which lacks the conserved effector locus (CEL) and is therefore unable to efficiently suppress PTI [55], [56]. Pathogen-induced deposition of callose at the cell wall is used as a marker of PTI [57]. We therefore measured whether RXLR29 delivery affects the capacity of Pst DC3000deltaCEL to induce callose deposition after infiltrating bacteria into leaves. In these experiments, YFP and ATR13 were expressed by the EDV vector in Pst DC3000deltaCEL, respectively as negative and positive controls. Arabidopsis Col-0 exhibited numerous callose deposits after infiltration with Pst DC3000deltaCEL-YFP (Fig. 7 A, B). The extent of callose deposition was reduced upon delivery of ATR13 and RXLR29 compared to YFP, indicating that both effectors suppress this form of PAMP-triggered cell wall defense.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.g007. Figure 7. . RXLR29 suppresses callose deposition in bacteria-inoculated Arabidopsis leaves.. Five-week-old Col-0 leaves were hand-infiltrated with 1108 cfu/ml Pst DC3000deltaCEL carrying YFP, RXLR29 or ATR13, as indicated. Leaf samples were taken at 12 h after infection and stained with aniline blue to visualize callose (A). The number of callose spots was quantified in each sample (B). The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.. . . . . . Hpa RXLR29 enhances disease susceptibility in planta. Suppression of defense can lead to enhanced susceptibility to pathogen infection. We therefore examined if EDV-delivery of RXLR29 affects the growth of Pseudomonas bacteria. ATR13 enhances Pst DC3000 growth on Arabidopsis [42] and was used as positive control. We found that delivery of RXLR29 or ATR13 enhanced growth of Pst DC3000 compared to delivery of YFP (Fig. 8). Also, the RXLR29 and ATR13 delivering bacteria produced more chlorosis in Col-0 at 3 dpi than the control (YFP). The enhanced level of bacterial growth was comparable between delivery of ATR13 and RXLR29. The Waco9 RXLR29 protein is therefore likely to be a bona fide Hpa effector.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0019328.g008. Figure 8. . RXLR29 enhances bacterial growth in Arabidopsis leaves.. Five-week-old Col-0 leaves were hand-infiltrated with 5105 cfu/ml Pst DC3000-LUX delivering YFP, ATR13 or RXLR29, as indicated. Bacterial growth in leaves at 0 and 3 dpi was measured by number of colony forming units (cfu) per mg of leaf tissue. Error bars indicate the standard error of bacterial counts. Enhanced growth was observed at day 3 for Pst delivering ATR13 or RXLR29 compared to YFP (T-test p value <0.0005)..
PMC4473984	Results. . Cd tolerance is decreased in abcc3 mutants and enhanced in AtABCC3 overexpressors. To assess whether AtABCC3 contributes to Cd tolerance, the growth of wild type and abcc3 seedlings was analysed at different Cd concentrations. In a previous study, it was shown that growth of Arabidopsis seedlings is not affected at Cd concentrations up to 15 muM, while it is slightly reduced at 30 muM and 60 muM CdSO4, and severely inhibited at 90 muM (Brunetti et al., 2011). Here, 7 d after germination, wild type and abcc3 seedlings were grown in the presence of 0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 muM CdSO4, and the fresh weight and root length were analysed after 9 d. As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of Cd and at 15 muM CdSO4, the growth of abcc3 and wild type seedlings was comparable, whereas in the presence of all Cd concentrations from 30 muM onwards the former was slightly but significantly more inhibited than the latter (Fig. 1A-C). In terms of fresh weight, the growth of abcc3 seedlings was inhibited from a concentration of 30 muM CdSO4 onwards (Fig. 1A-C), whereas roots were significantly shorter only at 30 muM and 60 muM CdSO4 (Fig. 1B, C).. .

Asterisks indicate a significant difference from the wild type (*P<0.05, **P<0.01). wt, wild type.. . . . These results suggest an involvement of AtABCC3 in Cd tolerance, and, to confirm this notion, Arabidopsis lines overexpressing AtABCC3 (AtABCC3ox) under the control of a beta-oestradiol-inducible promoter were produced (Zuo et al., 2000). Overexpression of AtABCC3 was analysed by means of real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in three independent homozygous lines named AtABCC3ox-20, AtABCC3ox-21, and AtABCC3ox-26. Seedlings from the wild type and these AtABCC3ox lines were grown in the presence of 60 muM CdSO4 with or without the inducer beta-oestradiol, and AtABCC3 transcript levels were analysed after 9 d of growth. As shown in Fig. 2A, the AtABCC3 mRNA level increased ~15-, 17-, and 13-fold compared with the wild type in AtABCC3ox-20, AtABCC3ox-21, and AtABCC3ox-26 seedlings, respectively.. . Fig. 2.. .

An effect of beta-oestradiol on seedling growth was ruled out, as no significant differences in fresh weight and root length were observed between wild type and AtABCC3ox seedlings after 9 d of growth in the presence or absence of beta-oestradiol, without Cd (Supplementary Fig. S1 available at JXB online).. To assess Cd tolerance, AtABCC3ox-20, AtABCC3ox-21, and AtABCC3ox-26 seedlings were grown in the presence of 0, 30, 60, and 90 muM CdSO4 with or without beta-oestradiol, and the fresh weight and root length were analysed after 9 d. No significant differences in either growth indicator were observed at 30 muM CdSO4 (Fig. 2B, C) in any of the AtABCC3ox seedlings grown in the presence or absence of the inducer. At 60 muM CdSO4, all three AtABCC3ox lines showed a significant increase in root length when grown in the presence of the inducer (Fig. 2C, D), whereas the fresh weight was comparable in seedlings grown in the presence or absence of beta-oestradiol (Fig. 2B).. At 90 muM CdSO4, all three AtABCC3ox lines showed a significant increase in root length (Fig. 2C), but not in fresh weight when grown in the presence of the inducer (Fig. 2B).. These results confirm an involvement of AtABCC3 in Cd tolerance.. . . . AtABCC3 is involved in vacuolar Cd2+ sequestration. To determine whether AtABCC3 plays a role in Cd transport into the vacuole, the cellular distribution of Cd was compared in the wild type and abcc3 mutants by means of selective Cd-sensing fluorochromes: BTC-5N (Lindberg et al., 2004, 2007) and Leadmium Green AM dye (Lu et al., 2008), specific for cytosolic and vacuolar Cd accumulation, respectively. Wild type protoplasts have been preliminarily used to define the cytosolic and vacuolar regions independently of the fluorescence, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online. Leaf protoplasts were isolated from wild type and abcc3 plants grown in the absence or presence of 60 muM CdSO4 for 9 d and 22 d, and loaded with either one of the two fluorochromes.. As shown in Fig. 3, BTC-5N-loaded protoplasts isolated from wild type and abcc3 plants grown in the absence of CdSO4 exhibited an orange-green signal due to red chlorophyll autofluorescence, and a green signal due to complexes between the fluorochrome and cytosolic divalent ions other than Cd (Fig. 3A, C, I, K, Q, left panel). When wild type and abcc3 plants were cultured in the presence of Cd, after 9 d BTC-5N-loaded protoplasts showed a comparable Cd-specific cytosolic fluorescence signal (Fig. 3B, D, Q, left panel), whereas after 22 d the Cd-specific cytosolic signal decreased in wild type protoplasts but significantly increased in abcc3 protoplasts (P<0.01) (Fig. 3J, L, Q, left panel).. .

Leadmium green-loaded protoplasts isolated from wild type and abcc3 plants grown in the absence of Cd had a very low fluorescence signal that could be detected in the vacuole by quantitative analysis (see the Materials and methods) (Fig. 3Q, right panel, and Fig. 4M) but was not detectable in fluorescence images (Fig. 3E, G, M, O). This is possibly due to interactions between the fluorochrome and Ca2+ that occur in the absence of Cd. When wild type and abcc3 protoplasts from plants cultured for 9 d in the presence of Cd were analysed, a slightly but significantly higher (P<0.05) fluorescence signal was detectable in the vacuoles of the former (Fig. 3F) than in those of the latter (Fig. 3H, Q, right panel). After 22 d in the presence of Cd, the vacuolar signal was almost unchanged in wild type vacuoles (Fig. 3N), whereas in vacuoles of abcc3 protoplasts it became significantly lower (P<0.01) than in the wild type (Fig. 3P, Q, right panel).. .

Asterisks indicate a significant difference from the absence of beta-oestradiol, within the same genotype (*P <0.05, **P<0.01). est, beta-oestradiol; V, vacuole. Scale bars=10 mum.. . . . These results indicate a decrease in vacuolar Cd and a concomitant increase in cytosolic Cd in abcc3 mutant protoplasts compared with those of the wild type, suggesting a role for ABCC3 in Cd transport into the vacuole.. To confirm the involvement of ABCC3 in Cd compartmentalization, the vacuolar Cd signal was analysed in two different AtABCC3ox lines. To detect a possible increase in vacuolar Cd, AtABCC3ox-21 and AtABCC3ox-26 plants were grown in the presence of 0 and 60 muM CdSO4, with or without beta-oestradiol; leaf protoplasts isolated after 5 d or 9 d were loaded with Leadmium Green AM dye. After 5 d of treatment with Cd, protoplasts from AtABCC3ox-21 and AtABCC3ox-26 plants grown in the presence of beta-oestradiol showed a significant increase (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively) in the vacuolar signal (Fig. 4C, F, M, left panel) compared with protoplasts grown without beta-oestradiol (Fig. 4B, E). Analogously, after 9 d of treatment with CdSO4 in the presence of beta-oestradiol, both AtABCC3ox-21 and AtABCC3ox-26 protoplasts exhibited a vacuolar signal (Fig. 4I, L, M, right panel) significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of protoplasts from plants grown without beta-oestradiol (Fig. 4H, K).. The Cd cytosolic signal was also analysed in protoplasts from AtABCC3ox-21 and AtABCC3ox-26 plants. After 9 d of treatment with Cd in the presence of beta-oestradiol, AtABCC3ox-21 and AtABCC3ox-26 protoplasts exhibited a cytosolic signal (Fig. 5C, F, G) significantly lower (P<0.01) than that of protoplasts grown in the absence of beta-oestradiol (Fig. 5B, E). These results indicate a lower cytosolic Cd accumulation and a corresponding increase in vacuolar Cd in AtABCC3ox protoplasts.. . Fig. 5.. .

Taken together, these data on the cellular distribution of Cd in abcc3 and in AtABCC3ox leaf protoplasts indicate that AtABCC3 plays an essential role in vacuolar cadmium sequestration.. To determine whether in ABCC3ox lines the increase in vacuolar Cd corresponds to an increase in total Cd accumulation, Cd content was analysed in wild type, AtABCC3ox-21, and AtABCC3ox-26 seedlings by means of ICP-MS. After 9 d of treatment with 60 muM CdSO4 in the presence of beta-oestradiol, wild type, AtABCC3ox-21, and AtABCC3ox-26 seedlings showed a comparable content of total Cd (62451.6, 69612.22, and 69840.01 mug g-1 FW, respectively).. To confirm these data, Cd content was analysed separately in shoots and roots from wild type, AtABCC3ox-21 and AtABCC3ox-26 seedlings exposed for 2 weeks at 30 muM or 60 muM CdSO4. As shown in Fig. 5, no significant difference in Cd content was observed at these Cd concentrations, in roots (Fig. 5H) or shoots (Fig. 5I), as well as in seedlings (Fig. 5J), of the overexpressing lines compared with the wild type. Together these data rule out an effect of AtABCC3 overexpression on Cd accumulation.. . . Overexpression of AtABCC3 has no effect on Cd tolerance of seedlings lacking or with reduced PC synthesis. To assess whether vacuolar sequestration of Cd by AtABCC3 is mediated by PCs, AtABCC3 was overexpressed in a cad1-3 mutant line defective in PCS and, consequently, in PC production (Howden et al., 1995). AtABCC3ox-cad1 plants were generated by crossing AtABCCox-21 with cad1-3 lines, and AtABCC3 overexpression was analysed in different lines homozygous for the cad1 mutation and the AtABCC3ox construct. Two lines, AtABCC3ox-cad1-53 and AtABCC3ox-cad1-59, overexpressing AtABCC3 in the presence of beta-oestradiol (Supplementary Fig. S3A at JXB online) were used for subsequent analysis. To assess Cd tolerance, AtABCC3ox-cad1-53 and AtABCC3ox-cad1-59 seedlings together with seedlings of the two parental lines, cad1-3 and AtABCC3ox-21, were grown in the presence of 0, 30, and 60 muM CdSO4 with or without beta-oestradiol. After 9 d, the root length and fresh weight were analysed. As shown in Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S3B at JXB online, in the absence of beta-oestradiol at 30 muM and 60 muM CdSO4, cad1-3, AtABCC3ox-cad1-53, and AtABCC3ox-cad1-59 seedling growth was completely inhibited, whereas root length and fresh weight of AtABCC3ox-21 seedlings were comparable with those of wild type seedlings (Fig. 2B, C). In the presence of beta-oestradiol (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S3B at JXB online) both concentrations of Cd were toxic to AtABCC3ox-cad1-53 and AtABCC3ox-cad1-59, pointing to a lack of effect of AtABCC3 overexpression in growth rescue in the absence of PCs, and suggesting that AtABCC3 acts in concert with PCs to control Cd tolerance.. .

(A, B) cad1-3, AtABCC3ox-21, AtABCC3ox-cad1-53, and AtABCC3ox-cad1-59 were incubated on medium containing 0, 15, 30, or 60 muM CdSO4 in the absence or presence of beta-oestradiol.

Interestingly, at 60 muM CdSO4, while AtABCC3ox-21 seedlings showed, as described above, a significant increase in root length upon addition of beta-oestradiol (Figs 2C, 6A), the growth of cad1-3, AtABCC3ox-cad1-53, and AtABCC3ox-cad1-59 seedlings was unaffected by addition of the inducer (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S3B at JXB online). To determine whether AtABCC3 overexpression enhances Cd tolerance at lower Cd concentrations that only slightly affect cad1-3 seedling growth, AtABCC3ox-cad1-53, AtABCC3ox-cad1-59, cad1-3, and AtABCC3ox-21 seedlings were grown in the presence of 15 muM CdSO4 with or without the inducer beta-oestradiol. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, after 9 d in the absence of beta-oestradiol, AtABCC3ox-21 seedlings show a growth comparable with that without Cd, whereas cad1-3, AtABCC3ox-cad1-53, and AtABCC3ox-cad1-59 seedling growth was slightly but significantly inhibited in terms of root length (Fig. 6A). In the presence of the inducer, the growth of AtBCC3ox-21 seedlings is comparable with that of seedlings grown without the inducer or without Cd (Fig. 6A, B). More interestingly, when grown in the presence of beta-oestradiol, AtABCC3ox-cad1-53 and AtABCC3ox-cad1-59 are as much inhibited in growth as the parent line cad1-3 in terms of root length (Fig. 6A, B) but not of fresh weight (Supplementary Fig. S3B at JXB online).. To provide further evidence that the effect of AtABCC3 is mediated by PCs, Cd tolerance of AtABCC3ox-21 and AtABCC3ox-26 seedlings was assessed in the presence of BSO, an inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), an enzyme that modulates GSH and PC synthesis (Howden and Cobbett, 1992). AtABCC3ox-21 and AtABCC3ox-26 seedlings were grown at 60 muM CdSO4 with or without beta-oestradiol, in the presence or absence of 0.5mM BSO, and root length was measured after 9 d. As shown in Fig. 6C and D, the increase in Cd tolerance observed in AtABCC3ox-21 and AtABCC3ox-26 seedlings when exposed to Cd in the presence of beta-oestradiol was not observed when BSO was added to the medium.. These results indicate that when PC biosynthesis is abated or reduced, Cd severely affects Arabidopsis growth even when AtABCC3 is overexpressed.. . . . AtABCC3 contributes to Cd tolerance and its expression is regulated by Cd. It has been reported that AtABCC1 and, to a lesser extent, AtABCC2 have a key role in Cd tolerance (Park et al., 2012). To determine the contribution of AtABCC3 to Cd tolerance relative to AtABCC1 and AtABCC2, the growth of wild type, abcc3, and atabcc1 atabcc2 double mutant seedlings was comparatively analysed at high Cd concentration (60 muM) where AtABCC3 was shown to have an effect (see above). After 9 d in the absence of Cd the growth of wild type, abcc3, and atabcc1 atabcc2 seedlings was comparable, whereas in the presence of 60 muM CdSO4 the growth of all seedlings was inhibited and, interestingly, atabcc1 atabcc2 seedling growth was only slightly more inhibited than that of abcc3 in terms of root length and fresh weight. This suggests a substantial contribution of AtABCC3 to Cd tolerance (Fig. 7A-C).. . Fig. 7.. .

It was shown above that ABCC3 acts in the transport of PC-Cd complexes as do ABCC1 and ABCC2: it was thus asked whether ABCC3 could complement the abcc1 abcc2 double mutation. To perform a complementation assay, Arabidopsis abcc1 abcc2 lines overexpressing AtABCC3 were produced by transforming abcc1 abcc2 double mutant plants with the construct pER8::35S-ABCC3 (see the Materials and methods). Overexpression of AtABCC3 was measured by means of qRT-PCR in three independent homozygous lines denoted AtABCC3ox-abcc1abcc2-1, AtABCC3ox-abcc1abcc2-3, and AtABCC3ox-abcc1abcc2-5 (see Supplementary Fig. S3C at JXB online). Cd tolerance of AtABCC3ox-abcc1abcc2-1 and AtABCC3ox-abcc1abcc2-3 seedlings was assessed at 0 and 60 muM CdSO4 with or without beta-oestradiol, in the presence or absence of 0.5mM BSO. After 9 d, seedling fresh weight and root length were analysed. As shown in Fig. 7D-F, a significant increase in both fresh weight and root length was observed in AtABCC3ox-abcc1abcc2-1 and AtABCC3ox-abcc1abcc2-3 seedlings grown with beta-oestradiol compared with uninduced seedlings.. The increase in root length of AtABCC3ox-abcc1abcc2-1 was not observed in the presence of 0.5mM BSO (Fig. 7D-F), indicating that the observed BSO effect is specific for the transporter AtABCC3.. To determine whether the relative transcript levels of AtABCC1, AtABCC2, and AtABCC3 are consistent with the above-reported Cd tolerance of abcc3 and atabcc1 atabcc2 seedlings, a qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from wild type, abcc3, and atabcc1 atabcc2 seedlings grown for 9 d at 0 or 60 muM CdSO4 was performed. As shown in Fig. 8A, in the absence of Cd the transcript levels of AtABCC1 and AtABCC2 were, respectively, 4- and 2-fold higher than that of AtABCC3. In contrast, at 60 muM CdSO4, the transcript levels of AtABCC1 and AtABCC2 did not increase, whereas the transcript level relative to AtABCC3 increased by 6.9-fold, being 1.7- and 3.4-fold higher, respectively, than that of AtABCC1 and AtABCC2. Interestingly, in abcc3 mutants at 60 muM CdSO4, the transcript levels of AtABCC1 and AtABCC2 were comparable with those of wild type seedlings, whereas in atabcc1 atabcc2 seedlings the level of AtABCC3 transcript further increased, compared with that of wild type seedlings, being 3.2- and 6.8-fold higher, respectively, than that of AtABCC1 and AtABCC2. The Cd-induced high level of AtABCC3 transcript accounts for the slight differences in Cd sensitivity between abcc3 and atabcc1 atabcc2 seedlings at 60 muM CdSO4 (Fig. 7A-C).. . Fig. 8.. .

To determine whether the relative slight differences in growth in the presence of Cd between abcc3 and atabcc1 atabcc2 mutants would be seen when Cd was added during the germination phase (see Park et al., 2012), the same Cd tolerance assay was performed by incubating wild type, abcc3, and atabcc1 atabcc2 seeds on a medium containing 60 muM CdSO4. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A at JXB online, after 14 d in the absence of Cd the growth of abcc3 seedlings and that of wild type and atabcc1 atabcc2 seedlings was comparable. In contrast, in the presence of 60 muM CdSO4, the growth of abcc3 seedlings was similar to that observed when seeds were germinated without Cd, whereas that of atabcc1 atabcc2 double mutants was severely inhibited in terms of root length (Supplementary Fig. S4A, B at JXB online). These data suggest that, in contrast to AtABCC1 and AtABCC2, AtABCC3 does not play a role in Cd tolerance during seed germination.. The relative transcript levels of AtABCC1, AtABCC2, and AtABCC3 under these experimental conditions were evaluated by means of a qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from wild type seedlings 5 d after germination at 60 muM CdSO4. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4C at JXB online, in the absence of Cd the levels of AtABCC1 and AtABCC2 transcripts were 4- and 2-fold higher, respectively, than that of AtABCC3, similar to what was described in the previous experiment (Fig. 8A), whereas in the presence of Cd the transcript levels of AtABCC3 did not increase. The lack of Cd-induced AtABCC3 expression during germination accounts for the dramatic differences in Cd sensitivity of abcc3 and atabcc1 atabcc2 seedlings under these experimental conditions.. As it is known that abcc3 seedlings are not sensitive to low Cd concentrations (15 muM) and only slight sensitive to 30 muM CdSO4 (Fig. 1), to determine whether AtABCC3 expression was induced at low Cd concentrations, the transcript level of AtABCC3 was analysed at different Cd concentrations in comparison with that of AtABCC1 and AtABCC2. A qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from wild type seedlings grown for 9 d at 0, 15, 30, or 60 muM CdSO4 was performed. As shown in Fig. 8B, the level of AtABCC1 and AtABCC2 transcripts in seedlings grown in the presence of all Cd concentrations was comparable with that in the absence of Cd. In contrast, while at 15 muM CdSO4 the AtABCC3 transcript level was comparable with that in the absence of Cd, at 30 muM CdSO4 a slight but significant increase (~1.5-fold) was observed.. These data indicate that little expression of AtABCC3 occurs at low Cd concentrations..
PMC3138417	Results. To determine whether this DART-MS combined by multivariate analysis can perform genetic discrimination based on global metabolic profiling, intact Arabidopsis thaliana mutant seeds were subjected to DART-MS without any sample preparation. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of DART-MS spectral data from intact seeds classified 14 different lines of seeds into two distinct groups: Columbia (Col-0) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype backgrounds. A hierarchical dendrogram based on partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) subdivided the Col-0 ecotype into two groups: mutant lines harboring defects in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway and mutants without these defects. These results indicated that metabolic profiling with DART-MS could discriminate intact Arabidopsis seeds at least ecotype level and metabolic pathway level within same ecotype..
PMC4810360	Results. . Identification of transcription factors that bind to the promoter regions of chlorophyll catabolic genes. To identify the TFs that directly control Chl degradation, we first constructed yeast strains carrying the HIS3 reporter gene driven by the promoter regions of the following Chl catabolic genes: NYC1, NOL, HCAR, PPH, PaO, RCCR, CYP89A9, MES16, SGR1, and SGR2. Then, we examined binding of ca. 1300TFs (ca. 70% of all Arabidopsis TFs) to these regions. After the initial screening with 343 mini-pools, we performed a second screening and identified 93 interactions between the 10 promoters and 54 individual TFs (Fig. S1). Among them, we were interested in the particular group of NAC TFs because three genes namely ANAC046, ANAC087, and ANAC100 were detected in experiments employing the promoters of NYC1, SGR1, SGR2, and PaO (Fig. S1). Phylogenetic analysis clustered these three proteins into the same clade as ANAC079, ORE1, and ORS1 in the NAM subgroup of group I of the NAC superfamily (Fig. S2)28. ANAC079, ANAC100, and ORE1 have miR164-complementary sites with 3 mismatches to miR164 and are likely to be target genes for this miRNA (Fig. S3).. Next, we examined the binding of six TFs to four promoters in a separate Y1H experiment (Fig. 2a). ANAC046 bound to all the promoters tested. For ANAC087, the TF most similar to ANAC046 (Fig. S2), the affinity to all of the promoters was low. ORE1 bound to the SGR2 and PaO promoters, and ORS1 did not bind to any of the promoters tested. Therefore, we chose ANAC046 for further analysis.. To examine the interactions between ANAC046 and promoters of the 12 chlorophyll catabolic genes, we employed transient effector-reporter analysis in leaf protoplasts. As shown in Fig. 2b, the VP16-fused form of ANAC046 clearly activated the reporter driven by the promoters of NYC1, SGR1, SGR2, and PaO, suggesting in planta binding of ANAC046 to these promoters. Thus, the results obtained in leaf protoplasts were consistent with those obtained in yeast. ANAC046 also activated MES16 promoter in planta with less extent, although this activation was not observed in yeast.. . . Phenotypic Analysis of ANAC046 Transgenic Plants. To elucidate the function of ANAC046 in Chl degradation, we produced transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively overexpressing ANAC046 (35S:ANAC046; OX) and plants expressing a chimeric repressor containing the SRDX domain at the C-terminus (35S:ANAC046-SRDX; SRDX). The SRDX plant is expected to show loss-of-function phenotype of ANAC046 and its functionally redundant transcription factors as a result of dominant suppression of its target genes29. We also obtained a putative knockout mutant, SM_3_27647 (KO), which has a transposon insertion in the ANAC046 coding region.. The OX plants germinated on MS-agar slightly later than WT plants (Fig. 3a). At 40 days after sowing (DAS), the OX plants had wavy rosette leaves and were remarkably smaller than WT plants (Fig. 3b). The KO and SRDX plants were slightly larger than WT plants during the course of development. The dry weight of aerial parts and roots was significantly lower in OX plants and that of roots was significantly higher in KO and SRDX plants than in WT plants (Fig. 3c). Chl content in the 8-9th leaf at 40 DAS was slightly higher in the KO and SRDX plants and significantly lower in OX plants than in the WT plants (Fig. 3d).. To compare the ultrastructure of chloroplasts, the leaves of WT, OX, KO, and SRDX plants at 40 DAS were analyzed under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). At the end of the light period, chloroplast structure was similar in all plants tested: all mesophyll chloroplasts contained several large starch granules (Fig. 3e), which were produced by photosynthesis during the day. At the end of the dark period, only small starch granules were visible in the chloroplasts of the WT, KO, and SRDX plants, whereas chloroplasts of the OX plants still contained several large starch granules (Fig. 3e). In line with these observations, iodine staining showed that the leaves of OX plants, but not those of the WT, KO, or SRDX plants, contained a high level of starch at the end of the dark period, whereas the starch level was high in the leaves of all plants at the end of the light period (Fig. 3f).. . . Involvement of ANAC046 in leaf senescence. To determine the involvement of ANAC046 in age-dependent senescence, we compared the plant phenotypes and Chl content in the leaves of OX, KO, SRDX, and WT plants at 35 and 70 DAS. Leaf yellowing was accelerated in the OX plants and delayed in the KO and SRDX plants in comparison with the WT plants (Fig. 4a). Leaf Chl content was significantly higher in the KO and SRDX plants than in the WT plants at both 35 and 70 DAS (Fig. 4b). At 70 DAS, Chl content in the leaves of the OX plants was approximately half that of the WT plants. CO2 assimilation rate was not significantly different among WT, OX, KO, and SRDX plants at 35 DAS, but was significantly higher in the KO and SRDX plants and slightly (but not significantly) lower in the OX plants than in the WT plants at 70 DAS (Fig. 4c). Ion leakage rate (a senescence indicator) was similar in all plants until 56 DAS (Fig. 4d). At 70 DAS, it was significantly higher in the OX plants but significantly lower in the KO and SRDX plants than in the WT plants.. The levels of photosynthetic proteins associated with PSI and PSII were assessed by western blotting with antibodies against the core proteins (PsaA and PsbA, respectively) and the antenna proteins of the light-harvesting complexes (Lhca1 and Lhcb1). The levels of the large subunit of Rubisco (RbcL), which is involved in carbon fixation, were also examined. At 35 DAS, we did not detect remarkable differences in the levels of the photosynthetic proteins among plants tested (Fig. 4e). At 70 DAS, much higher levels of all proteins were detected in the KO and SRDX plants than in the WT plants, whereas all the proteins tested were below the detection limit in the OX plants.. We also analyzed the effect of ANAC046 on dark-induced senescence by transferring the plants at 35 DAS to continuous darkness. Leaves of the OX plants grown on MS-agar were pale green and somewhat smaller than WT plants at 35 DAS (Fig. 5a). Chl content decreased faster in the OX plants, but slower in the KO and SRDX plants, than in the WT plants (Fig. 5b). The SRDX plants retained a high level of Chl even at 13 days after dark treatment (DAD). Ion leakage rate was significantly higher in the OX plants at 4 and 13 DAD and significantly lower in SRDX plants at 8 and 13 DAD than in the WT plants (Fig. 5c). The levels of all the photosynthetic proteins tested drastically decreased at 4 DAD in the OX plants but remained constant in the WT, KO, and SRDX plants (Fig. 5d). They were below the detection limit at 8 DAD in the OX plants. In contrast, the KO and SRDX plants contained substantial amounts of photosynthetic proteins even at 13 DAD, when these proteins became undetectable in WT plants.. To obtain a comprehensive view of transcriptomic changes in transgenic plants, we performed microarray experiments (Fig. 6). We used RNAs from three independent lines of the OX and SRDX plants for the analysis. The level of ANAC046 expression in these transgenic plants was more than 17-fold higher than that of WT (Fig. S4). We also confirmed that ANAC046 expression in the KO plants was extremely low. We found that SRDX and KO plants, which had similar phenotypes, also had similar transcriptomes (r=0.71; Fig. S5). The expression of Chl catabolic genes, including NYC1, CLH1, PPH, PaO, SGR1, and SGR2 was markedly higher in the OX plants and lower in the KO and SRDX plants than in the WT plants (Fig. 6a). Likewise, the expression of marker genes for leaf senescence, including SAG12 and SAG13, was also higher in the OX plants and lower in the KO and SRDX plants than in WT plants (Fig. 6b). We also examined age-dependent changes in the expression of genes upregulated in each of the three transgenic lines by using publicly available microarray data of wild type (Fig. 6c)30. The expression of most genes upregulated in the OX plants increased with age, whereas the expression of most genes upregulated in the KO and SRDX plants decreased with age (Fig. 6c). These data clearly support accelerated senescence of OX plants and delayed senescence of KO and SRDX plants..
PMC4260840	Results. . Shoot architecture of ugt78d2 plants is altered. A loss-of-function mutant of the flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase UGT78D2 showed a pronounced shoot phenotype (Fig.2). ugt78d2 mutant plants exhibited a significantly shorter stature soon after bolting (Fig.2). At a later growth stage, the mutants developed more branches with an obvious loss of apical dominance (Supporting Information TableS1). To elucidate the mechanism underlying this dwarfism, the cellular architectures of inflorescence stems were examined. In ugt78d2, the parenchymal cell length was reduced significantly when compared with the wild-type. In contrast with stems, other organs were not obviously affected. The lengths of hypocotyls and siliques of ugt78d2 were similar to those of the wild-type (TableS1). Young seedlings and root systems developed in the same way in both genotypes (Fig.S1) Transformation of ugt78d2 with a genomic fragment covering the complete UGT78D2 gene rescued plants from growth disturbances and restored the wild-type phenotype (Fig.S2). Thus, the lesion in UGT78D2 was responsible for the observed shoot growth defects.. . Figure 2. . Phenotypes of flavonoid biosynthesis-related mutants. Shoots of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and the indicated mutants were imaged after 28d of growth. Bar, 5cm.. . . . . . The ugt78d2 growth phenotype is flavonol dependent. Flavonoids are probable candidates responsible for the ugt78d2 phenotype, as UGT78D2 has been characterized as a flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase and the ugt78d2 mutant exhibits an altered flavonoid pattern (Lee etal., 2005; Tohge etal., 2005). Moreover, transformation of ugt78d2 with the UGT78D2 gene did not only re-establish the wild-type growth phenotype, but also restored its flavonol pattern (Fig.3a). A flavonoid-deficient tt4 ugt78d2 double mutant was generated to further check this effect. The growth defects of ugt78d2 were indeed eliminated in tt4 ugt78d2, indicating that they were flavonoid dependent. Moreover, this observation in the flavonoid-deficient background indicated that the growth defects were not related to the repression of specific flavonol-3-O-glucoside derivatives (k2, k3, q2 and q3) in ugt78d2 (Figs2, 3a). In addition to flavonols, UGT78D2 also recognizes anthocyanidins as substrates (Lee etal., 2005; Tohge etal., 2005). To test the possible involvement of anthocyanins in the development of the ugt78d2 growth phenotype, an anthocyanin-deficient tt18 ugt78d2 double mutant was generated. However, loss of the anthocyanidin synthase in the tt18 ugt78d2 line did not rescue the growth defects of ugt78d2 (Figs2). The flavonol glycoside pattern of tt18 ugt78d2 was similar to that of ugt78d2 (Fig.3a). By contrast, the introgression of fls1 (accession N) into ugt78d2, which specifically blocks the biosynthesis of the flavonol moieties, restored wild-type-like growth (Fig.S3). The impact of flavonols was further supported by the slightly repressed growth of the tt3 mutant in comparison with its genetic background Ler; the loss of dihydroflavonol reductase in the tt3 mutant leads to enhanced k1 levels (Fig.S4; Peer etal., 2001). Collectively, these observations indicated that the ugt78d2 growth phenotype was flavonol dependent and that anthocyanins were not responsible for the ugt78d2 growth defects.. . Figure 3. . Flavonol glycoside pattern in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants affecting flavonoid biosynthesis and conjugation.

The scale of all representative high-performance liquid chromatograms is identical. Peaks u1-u8 represent unknown flavonoids. SM, sinapoyl malate. (b) Quantification of k1 (Fig.1b) in the wild-type and flavonoid metabolism-related mutants. The means of k1SD from four biological samples (a pool of three to five individual stem segments for one sample) are shown. k1 was quantified using kaempferol aglycone as a standard. Letters above the error bars represent a significant difference between genotypes by a paired t-test (P<0.01).. . . . . . The ugt78d2 phenotype is correlated with kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside. To identify the flavonols responsible for the ugt78d2 phenotype, a genetic approach using mutants defective in flavonol biosynthetic and/or conjugating steps was employed. In concert with published data (Yonekura-Sakakibara etal., 2008; Stracke etal., 2010b), six flavonol glycosides were detected in wild-type stems. Three kaempferol glycosides (k1-k3) were the most abundant flavonols, whereas three quercetin glycosides (q1-q3) were present at much lower levels (Fig.3a). No flavonol aglycones were detected in the wild-type and ugt78d2, which is in accordance with previous analyses of the single 3-O-glycosylation mutants ugt78d1 and ugt78d2 (Tohge etal., 2007; Yin etal., 2012) (Fig.1). Furthermore, even the double mutant ugt78d1 ugt78d2, which blocks the major enzymes performing the initial 3-O-glycosylation of the flavonol moiety, did not accumulate aglycones (Yin etal., 2012). In accordance with the loss of 3-O-glucosyltransferase activity in ugt78d2, the 3-O-glucoside derivatives (k2, k3, q2 and q3) were strongly reduced, whereas the 3-O-rhamnoside derivatives (k1 and q1) were elevated, when compared with the wild-type counterpart (Fig.3a). Therefore, both k1 and q1 were positively correlated with the ugt78d2 growth defects.. A tt7 ugt78d2 double mutant was generated in order to further distinguish whether the increases in k1 and/or q1 levels were related to the ugt78d2 growth phenotype. The conversion of kaempferol to quercetin is blocked in tt7 (Fig.1). As expected, tt7 ugt78d2 was devoid of q1 and accompanied by an even larger amount of k1 than in ugt78d2 (Fig.3b). tt7 ugt78d2 was more severely dwarfed than ugt78d2, indicating that a further enhanced k1 level led to a more pronounced phenotype (Fig.2). These observations suggested that the development of the ugt78d2 growth defects was independent of quercetin derivatives, and that k1 was sufficient to induce the ugt78d2 phenotype.. k1 contains 3-O-rhamnosyl and 7-O-rhamnosyl residues (Fig.1b). To further substantiate that k1 was responsible for the observed ugt78d2 phenotype, additional mutants were employed to selectively inhibit the attachment of 3-O- or 7-O-rhamnosyl residues to the k1 backbone. The attachment of these residues to the k1 backbone is catalyzed by UGT78D1 and UGT89C1, respectively (Jones etal., 2003; Yonekura-Sakakibara etal., 2007). As expected, k1 could not be detected in ugt78d2 ugt89c1, but unknown flavonol derivatives accumulated (Fig.3a). Importantly, the ugt78d2 phenotype reverted to a wild-type stature in this double mutant (Fig.2). Likewise, no ugt78d2-like phenotype was observed in ugt78d1 ugt78d2, which was also devoid of k1 (Figs2, 3a). All of these observations clearly indicated that k1 was indeed the flavonol metabolite inducing the ugt78d2 phenotype.. . . Basipetal auxin transport is reduced in ugt78d2 plants. The dwarf phenotype of ugt78d2 resembled that of the abcb1 abcb19 double mutant, which was greatly impaired in auxin transport (Noh etal., 2001). As flavonols have been postulated to be endogenous auxin transport inhibitors, we reasoned that the increase in k1 suppressed auxin transport in inflorescence stems, resulting in the growth defects. Therefore, polar transport of [3H]-IAA was measured in inflorescence stem segments. NPA-sensitive, basipetal auxin transport in ugt78d2 was reduced significantly to c. 45% of the wild-type level, whereas acropetal auxin transport remained unchanged (Figs4a, S5). Importantly, auxin transport activity further decreased to c. 25% of the wild-type level in the tt7 ugt78d2 double mutant, which accumulated even greater amounts of k1 (Figs3b, 4a). There was a dose-dependent, linear relationship between the k1 level and PAT, when comparing the wild-type, ugt78d2, tt7 and tt7 ugt78d2 (Fig.4b). The regulation did not affect the transcript level of genes encoding major, putative auxin export proteins, as mRNA levels of PIN1, PIN3, PIN7, ABCB1 and ABCB19 were not significantly different in wild-type and ugt78d2 stems (Fig.S6).. . Figure 4. . Basipetal auxin transport in inflorescence stems. (a) Basipetal auxin transport in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type, ugt78d2, tt7 and tt7 ugt78d2 basal stem segments.

Closed bars, +NPA; open bars, -NPA. Letters above the error bars represent a significant difference between genotypes by a paired t-test (P<0.05). (b) Basipetal auxin transport in relation to k1 levels. Mean value and standard error are plotted. A linear relationship was observed (R2=0.9911).. . . . The altered PAT also raised the question of whether there was a general difference in auxin responsiveness. However, several auxin-inducible marker genes were up-regulated by exogenous IAA application in the same manner in ugt78d2 and the wild-type (Fig.S7).. . . Free IAA level is reduced in ugt78d2 inflorescence stems. To examine whether the reduced auxin transport influenced the concentration of free IAA in ugt78d2 stems, the free IAA contents of three consecutive stem segments of ugt78d2 and wild-type plants were compared. The endogenous levels of free IAA in the apical inflorescence segments were not different from those of the wild-type (P>0.05), whereas the middle and basal stem segments of ugt78d2 contained lower steady-state IAA levels than the wild-type counterparts (P<0.05; Table1). This suggested that the decreased IAA content in the lower parts of the inflorescence stem of ugt78d2 was caused by the reduced basipetal transport of auxin from sites of its biosynthesis in the apex.. .

Gravitropism of the inflorescence stem is delayed in ugt78d2 plants. The reduction of PAT in the inflorescence stems of ugt78d2 could also affect tropic responses. Therefore, gravitropism was analyzed in the mutant. Four-week-old plants were laid down horizontally in the dark to exert a gravistimulus, which would lead to an upward bending of the inflorescence stems. The bending angle of the inflorescence stem was monitored at different time points after the gravistimulus. ugt78d2 exhibited a strongly delayed gravitropic response, indicating that the repressed auxin transport was correlated with a reduced gravitropism in ugt78d2 inflorescence stems (Fig.5).. .

PMC5047655	RESULTS. To determine when and how the shapes of Arabidopsis and Capsella diverge, we first compared the growth rates in overall length and width. We chose a starting point when the gynoecium primordia are similar in shape and size, 40m in length. This stage is referred to as 0 days after initiation (DAI) and is equivalent to stage 6 of Arabidopsis flower development (Roeder and Yanofsky, 2006). From 0-2 DAI defines an initial phase of high growth rate preferentially along the longitudinal axis of the gynoecium in both Capsella and Arabidopsis (Table1). After this early phase of anisotropic growth, there is a drop in both growth rate in length and anisotropy in Capsella (Table1, Fig.1B,C), whereas in Arabidopsis anisotropy is maintained while growth rate in length is less reduced (Table1, Fig.1B,D). Thus, the development of Capsella and Arabidopsis fruits can be divided into two phases: an early phase of relatively high growth rate in length, followed by a second phase during which this growth rate is lower. Growth in width is constant during these two phases (Table1).. Fig. 1.Fruit growth analysis. (A) Mature fruits from Arabidopsis (left) and Capsella (right) with tissues indicated as s (style), v (valve) and r (replum). Mediolateral and proximodistal orientations are indicated. (B) Fruit width plotted against length during Capsella (black diamonds) and Arabidopsis (grey crosses) fruit development (natural logarithm scales). The gradient for the fitted line for Arabidopsis (orange) is 0.49 (growth in length>width). There are two distinct gradients for Capsella: an early phase of 0.33 (green line, growth in length>width) and a later phase of 1.14 (blue line, growth rate in width>length). Red dashed line shows a gradient of 1 for comparison. (C) Capsella fruit length (black diamonds) and width (grey crosses) plotted against time from initiation to maturity.

Scale bars: 1 mm in C,D.. Table1.Growth rates (%/h) during development of Capsella and Arabidopsis fruits. To determine the shape changes during these two phases we used optical projection tomography (OPT) and scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) to image different stages. In the early phase (0-2 DAI) the shapes of the Capsella and Arabidopsis gynoecia are similar: they initiate as an oval ridge with a central groove that grows into a hollow cylinder by 2 DAI (Fig.2A-C,J). However, between 2 and 8.5 DAI the gynoecia of Capsella and Arabidopsis become morphologically distinct. The Arabidopsis gynoecium continues to elongate as a cylindrical shape throughout development (2-18 DAI), resulting in a long thin fruit (Fig.2K,L,N,O) of near-circular circumference (Fig.2M,P). By contrast, the Capsella gynoecium develops into a more rounded structure with an oval circumference and topped by a narrow style (8.5 DAI, Fig.2D-F). This shape is known as an oblate spheroid (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, 1999). From 8.5 to 11.5 DAI, the base of the Capsella fruit becomes increasingly tapered and the distal part of the valves grows larger to produce a heart shape (Fig.2G,H) that is flattened in cross-section (Fig.2I). 9 DAI corresponds to the fertilisation stage (stage 13 of Arabidopsis flower development), and the characteristic heart shape of Capsella fruits therefore forms while the seeds develop inside. Based on these shape changes, the second growth phase in Capsella (Table1) is divided into a middle (oblate spheroid) and late (heart-shape) phase, whereas in Arabidopsis the second phase shape is constant throughout development..

Approach to measuring and modelling growth. The observed changes in fruit shape could be generated by many different growth patterns. Consider a simplified example of a 2D square piece of tissue that grows into a vertically elongated rectangle (Fig.3). This transformation could be generated by a pattern of uniform anisotropic growth, in which growth rate along the vertical axis is higher than that along the horizontal axis. An initially square grid or set of marked circles would then be uniformly stretched (Fig.3A,B). The vertical growth rate of each region (circle or square) would be:. (1)where T is time, Y0 is the length of the vertical axis at T0, and Y1 is the length of the vertical axis at T1, while the horizontal growth rate would be:. (2)The square could also be transformed into an elongated rectangle by a pattern of non-uniform anisotropic growth, with higher growth rate at the bottom than the top (Fig.3C). Sections in the original grid would then have different sizes in the resultant elongated rectangle. The growth rates of each region could again be estimated by taking the difference in the natural logarithms, although these values would no longer be uniform over the tissue.. Fig. 3.Growing a 2D square. (A) Starting 2D square at T0 marked with a grid (i), virtual clones (ii) and polarity field (iii). (B) Resultant rectangle shape after uniform anisotropic growth: grid has deformed uniformly (i) and virtual clones have uniform size and shape (ii). (C) Resultant rectangle shape as in B, but with non-uniform anisotropic growth (higher growth at the bottom). The grid has deformed non-uniformly (i) and the virtual clones differ in size and shape across the rectangle (ii). (D) With higher Kper in the middle than at the top and bottom, the shape will bulge in the middle and give rise to a rounded shape. This curvature was not specified but emerges as the result of tissue conflicts. Arrows (Dii) indicate clones that splay out at the edge of bulge. Scale bars: 1mm.. Similar to marking the tissue with circles in the grid, individual cells could be marked in a biological system to capture the distribution of cellular growth patterns across a tissue. We used a Cre-Lox heat shock-inducible system, Brother of Brainbow (BOB) (Wachsman et al., 2011), to mark randomly distributed cells with either CFP or RFP upon induction. We marked cells at various times and imaged resultant clone patterns at specified lengths of the gynoecium: 300m, 500m, 1mm, 2mm and 4mm, using florescence or confocal microscopy. We assumed an initial cell size of 77m based on measurements at 0 DAI in Arabidopsis and 4-6 DAI in Capsella. In Capsella, cell sizes were similar between 4 and 6 DAI and so it was assumed that cell size was maintained at 7m from 0 DAI (TableS1). As with the circles in the grid example (Fig.3), assuming that the initial cells are of uniform size and isodiametric shape, growth rates along different axes can be estimated from the dimensions of the resultant clones.. The transformation of a square into a rectangle in 2D is more straightforward than the growth of a tissue, which can curve and deform in 3D as a result of mechanical constraints. In this situation, computational modelling is needed to relate the observed clonal patterns to the underlying specified growth patterns. We used the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework, in which growth rates can be specified by factors that are distributed across the tissue (Green et al., 2010; Kennaway et al., 2011; Kuchen et al., 2012; Sauret-Gueto et al., 2013). The tissue is modelled as a continuous sheet, termed the canvas, that is mechanically connected and can deform in 3D. A polarity field allows anisotropic growth to be incorporated. Polarity is specified with a diffusible factor, POLARISER (POL), which propagates from regions of high to low concentration (Fig.3A-Diii). The gradient of POL is used to specify a local polarity, allowing parallel (Kpar) or perpendicular (Kper) growth rates to be separately specified.. We distinguish between specified growth (inputs to the model) and resultant growth (output) (described by Kennaway et al., 2011). The specified growth rate of a region is the rate at which that region would grow if it were free from any mechanical constraints of surrounding tissue. The resultant growth rate is the rate at which that region grows when mechanical constraints of neighbouring tissue are taken into account. If the tissue has uniform isotropic growth rates, or all tissue grows with the same anisotropic growth rate in the same orientation (Fig.3B,C), then there is no tissue conflict and specified and resultant growth are the same. In most other cases, conflicts between connected regions that are specified to grow at different rates or orientations generate deformations and curving of tissue (rotations) that are not explicit in the specified growth pattern but emerge through the mechanical conflicts. For example, if a square shape is grown with a higher Kper in the middle than at the top and bottom, the shape will bulge in the middle (Fig.3D). The initial square grid has become curved and polarity is no longer uniformly vertical. The curvature (regional rotation) was not part of the specified growth but emerges as the result of tissue conflicts. If curvature does not fully resolve the conflicts, residual stresses are also generated. In our models, we assume that these residual stresses are dissipated during growth (Kennaway et al., 2011). Experimentally observed clone sizes and orientations do not give specified growth rates (inputs to the model) but can be compared with virtual clones or resultant growth rates generated as the result of running the model (outputs). For example, virtual clones (circles) in Fig.3Dii splay out at the edge of the bulge (arrowed). This reorientation is not an explicit part of the initial specified growth pattern but emerges from the resultant growth and connectivity of the tissue.. Each model is composed of three components: a starting canvas shape (loosely based on the size and shape of the gynoecium at 0 DAI, simplified as a short oval cylinder) with regional factors, a growth regulatory network and a polarity system (Fig.4C-E). The connectedness of the tissue results in shapes and features, such as curvature, that were not specified in the model and result from regional growth conflicts. Rather than match all the details of the clones and fruit shape changes, we tried to capture the general character of the clones and shape transitions in each phase..

Scale bars: 10m in Aii,Bii; 50m in C,D; 100m in Ai,Bi,F-H.. . . Early phase. The early phase is characterised by high growth rates in length and a cylindrically shaped gynoecium in both species. Because we were unable to easily image clones at 2 DAI, we imaged them at 4 DAI (300m length), which covers the early phase and beginning of the middle phase. We imaged epidermal clones for multiple samples and collated them onto a mean shape of the organ at 4 DAI to generate a clone map (Fig.4). The mean shapes of the Capsella and Arabidopsis gynoecia have already started to diverge at 4 DAI: Capsella has a wider and more rounded shape (Fig.4Ai) than Arabidopsis (Fig.4Bi). This difference in shape is most likely generated in the middle phase (see below).. Consistent with length/width (L/W) growth rates, the clones that capture the early phase of growth (0-2 DAI) are elongated along the longitudinal axis in both Capsella and Arabidopsis (Fig.4Aii,Bii). Comparing Capsella and Arabidopsis clones induced at 0 DAI and imaged at 4days after induction gave an average L/W ratio of 5.2 and 7.7, respectively. This anisotropic shape of the clones is correlated with cell division rates, with two to three rounds of cell division along the longitudinal axis and zero or one round of cell division along the circumferential axis in both species. Growth is mostly uniform across the gynoecium in both species. However, clones near the base and the apex in Capsella and Arabidopsis are shorter, suggesting slower growth along the proximal distal axis in these regions (Fig.4Ai,Bi).. To determine how the growth rate of the clones compares to whole-organ growth values, the average growth rates of the clone major axis (Kmax) and minor axis (Kmin) were calculated (Table2) based on growth rates in defined regions (TableS3). Since the clones are anisotropic along the longitudinal axis of the gynoecium, Kmax is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the gynoecium and Kmin is aligned with the circumference. The values of Kmax are comparable to high growth rates in length for the early and middle phases in both Arabidopsis and Capsella (Table2). However, the values of Kmin are lower than the whole-organ growth rates in width in both species (Table2). This could be explained if the cells were not isodiametric in shape at the time of induction. For example, if the cells were smaller than 7m in width, growth rates would be underestimated. Overall, the clone patterns show that the high longitudinal growth in the early stages of development is distributed throughout the gynoecium of both species and slightly lower towards the base and style.. Table2.Growth. rates of clones (%/h) during early and middle stages of fruit development. To model this anisotropic growth during the early phase using the GPT framework, we created a longitudinal gradient of POL in the initial canvas. This was achieved by having a region of POL production at the base. The result is a proximodistally oriented polarity field (Fig.4C). To account for the observed anisotropy in growth, the specified growth rates are higher parallel to the polarity than perpendicular to the polarity (for Capsella Kpar=1.4%/h and Kper=1.15%/h and for Arabidopsis Kpar=1.3%/h and Kper=0.6%/h). These growth rates were specified based on L/W growth rate ratios during the individual growth phases of the gynoecium and fruit. To enhance longitudinal growth during the early phase, we introduced a factor (EPHASE) that promotes Kpar from 0-2 DAI (Fig.4E). As the clonal analysis spans 0-4 DAI, EPHASE is inactive during the 3-4 DAI period. In addition, the fact that both species only have a few clones near the base and presumptive style suggests lower growth in these regions, and so we introduced two additional factors active during 3-4 DAI: BASE, which inhibits Kpar and Kper; and STYLE, which inhibits Kper (Fig.4D,E). Growth specified in this way causes the canvas to deform to give resultant sizes and shapes that broadly match those of the gynoecia observed at 4 DAI (Fig.4F,G). The output shape for both models tapers towards the base and style because of the inhibition of Kper in these regions, which creates a conflict in growth rate between these regions and the adjoining valve (Fig.4H). The Capsella shape tapers more than the Arabidopsis shape because of the higher rate of Kper.. To determine whether the model could account for the experimental pattern of clones, virtual clones (circular regions) were introduced into the models at 0 DAI. The resultant virtual clone shapes (Fig.4F,G) are broadly similar to the experimental clones (Fig.4Ai,Bi): they are anisotropic in shape, elongated parallel to the proximodistal axis and are slightly wider in the model for Capsella compared with Arabidopsis. In addition, the growth rates and anisotropy of clones in the model are similar to those of experimental clones (TableS2). Thus, a proximodistal polarity field combined with a set of growth rules that are similar between the species can explain both gynoecium forms during the early phase and early part of the middle phase.. . . Middle phase. The middle phase is characterised by a reduced growth rate in length compared with the early phase (Table2). During the middle phase, Capsella produces a rounded gynoecium with a flattened cross-section and Arabidopsis produces a longer and cylindrically shaped gynoecium. To capture the growth patterns that generate this divergence of shape, clones were induced at 2.5-3 DAI and imaged 6days later when the gynoecia reached 1mm in length (Fig.5A,B). At this stage, distinct regions and tissue types become evident at the fruit surface in both species. As with other members of the Brassicaceae family, Arabidopsis and Capsella fruits develop lateral valves that are attached to a medial replum and the structure is topped with a style and stigmatic tissue (Fig.2) (Roeder and Yanofsky, 2006). To simplify the analysis, we considered clones induced in the style, replum and valve tissues individually.. Fig. 5.Gynoecium clonal analysis and modelling of the middle phase.

Coloured chart represents resultant growth rates (%/h). Scale bars: 10m in Aii,iii,Bii,iii; 50m in C; 100m in Ai,Bi,E-H.. Clones induced in the style of both species are elongated along the proximodistal axis (Fig.5Ai,Bi). This is captured by calculating the average L/W ratio of the clones induced in the style in Capsella as 8.4 (0.04 s.d., N=2) and 3.1 (0.2, N=5) in Arabidopsis (TableS3). This anisotropy is correlated with two to three rounds of cell division along the major axis and no cell division along the minor axis.. Similar to the clones in the style, clones induced in the replum in both species exhibit clear elongation along the proximodistal axis (Fig.5Aii,Bii). The average L/W ratio of the clones induced in the replum is 2.8 (1.0, N=21) for Capsella and 5.7 (2.0, N=5) for Arabidopsis (TableS3). The anisotropic shape of the clones is correlated with higher cell division rates along the major axis of the clones (two to three rounds) compared with the minor axis (zero or one round). Overall, during the middle phase in both Capsella and Arabidopsis the growth in the style and the replum is anisotropic, with a higher growth rate along the proximodistal axis.. Unlike clones in the style and the replum, clones induced in the valves show a divergent pattern of growth during the middle phase in Capsella and Arabidopsis. In Capsella, these valve clones are uniform in size and mostly isotropic in shape (Fig.5Ai,iii). In Arabidopsis, valve clones are also uniform in size but elongated along the proximodistal axis of the gynoecium (Fig.5Bi,iii). The average L/W ratios of the clones are 1.0 (0.4, N=22) in Capsella and 3.0 (0.9, N=83) in Arabidopsis (TableS3). This is correlated with differences in cell division patterns, as in Capsella there are one to two rounds of cell division along both axes (Fig.5Aiii), whereas in Arabidopsis there are two to three rounds of cell division along the proximodistal axis and one round of cell division along the mediolateral axis (Fig.5Biii). The anisotropic shape of the clones is also correlated with differences in cell expansion, as valve cells are no longer isodiametric but wider in Capsella (Fig.5Aiii) and longer in Arabidopsis (Fig.5Biii).. To determine how growth rates vary between regions during the middle phase, the growth rates of clones in the style, replum and valve regions were calculated (Table2). For Capsella, Kmax is similar for valves and replum but higher in the style, whereas for Arabidopsis Kmax is highest in the replum (Table2). By contrast, Kmin in Capsella (along the circumferential axis) is lower in the replum and style than in the valves (Table2), whereas Kmin in Arabidopsis is similar across all three tissues. The growth rates in the valves of both species match the whole-organ L/W growth rates (Table2).. When calculating the growth rates using the major and minor axes of the clones in valves of Capsella, the orientations of the clones did not always align parallel to the proximodistal axis of the gynoecium. Instead, the clones in the valves diverge away from the base and converge back towards the style (Fig.S1A). By contrast, in Arabidopsis valves the major axes of the clones align with the proximodistal axis of the gynoecium (Fig.5Bi). Thus, clone patterns in the valves of Capsella show uniform isotropic growth with a divergent then convergent pattern, whereas for Arabidopsis they show uniform anisotropic growth parallel to the proximodistal axis.. Models of the middle phase need to account for the oblate spheroid shape of Capsella and the cylindrical shape of Arabidopsis gynoecium by 8-9 DAI. They must account for the proximodistal anisotropic clone patterns in the style and the replum in both species, and for the valve clones, which are wider with a divergent and convergent pattern in Capsella, as opposed to the narrow, parallel clone patterns in Arabidopsis.. These gynoecium shapes and clone patterns cannot be accounted for by continuing with the simple growth interactions established in the early phase (0-2 DAI, Fig.S2). To account for the clone patterns and growth rates during the middle phase we inactivated general promotion of Kpar (EPHASE is switched off). In addition to STYLE and BASE, we introduced a factor, REP, into the model. REP is expressed in a central band and inhibits Kper (Fig.5C,D). This interaction was proposed to account for clones in the replum being highly anisotropic along the proximodistal axis (Fig.5Aii,Bii). The canvas was grown to 8.5 DAI for Capsella and 9 DAI for Arabidopsis. The longitudinal views of the modelling outputs broadly match the observed gynoecium sizes and shapes at a similar stage (Fig.5E,F). In addition, the virtual clones in the style and replum regions resemble the anisotropic shape of the observed clones in these regions. The growth rates and anisotropy of the virtual clones are similar to those observed in the middle phase (TableS3). In both models, the shape tapers at the base and style because of inhibition of Kper in these regions, although this is more extreme for Capsella. This differential growth creates a conflict that results in deformation of the polarity field so that it diverges from the base and converges towards the style, accounting for the virtual clones in the valve showing a similar pattern (Fig.5Ai,E,Gi, Fig.S2). Virtual clones in the Arabidopsis model also run parallel to the polarity, which is parallel to the proximodistal axis of the model, matching the observed clones (Fig.5Bi,F,Gii). Therefore, to account for the gynoecium shape changes and observed clone patterns during the middle phase it is sufficient to reduce the rate of Kper in the style, base and replum regions, while continuing with higher value of Kper in Capsella compared with Arabidopsis established during the early phase.. These regional growth interactions can account for the observed clone patterns and many of the gynoecium shape features by the end of the middle phase. However, a major difference between the model and experimental observations is evident from cross-sections of Capsella gynoecia, which reveal a flattened oval that contrasts with the rounded shape obtained with the model (Fig.2F, Fig.5Hi). This reflects the gynoecium having an oblate spheroid rather than a spherical shape. Given the oblate spheroid shape of the valve, the distance from the style to the base is greater when following the middle of the valve than when following the replum (Fig.S3). We therefore hypothesised that enhanced growth along the midvalve might be needed to account for this shape. To test this idea, we introduced a factor, MIDVALVE, into the Capsella model. MIDVALVE is active in a thin band down the middle of the valves (Fig.5C). This observation was included in the model such that MIDVALVE promotes Kpar giving rise to narrower sectors close to the midvalve (Fig.5E). To stop the midvalve from becoming a wide region, Kper was inhibited by MIDVALVE. Higher Kpar in the midvalve creates a conflict with the rest of the valve that tends to flatten the shape. The resultant cross-sectional shape of the Capsella model at 11.5 DAI broadly matches the flattened oval shape of the gynoecium at this stage (Fig.5Hii).. Taken together, this analysis shows that the observed shape changes and clone patterns during the middle phase can be accounted for using regional factors in the midvalve, style and replum to alter local specified growth rates parallel or perpendicular to an initial proximodistal polarity.. . . Late phase. The late phase is characterised by a transformation in Capsella from an oblate spheroid to a heart-shaped fruit. In Arabidopsis, no major change in shape is observed during the late phase. However, in both species overall growth rates in length and width are maintained at similar rates to the middle phase. To capture the growth patterns in Capsella during the late phase we induced clones at 3.5, 5.5 and 6 DAI (middle phase) and imaged 6 or 8days after induction when the fruit length had reached 2mm (Fig.6A,B) and 4mm (Fig.6C), respectively. Similarly, in Arabidopsis we induced clones at 3 and 5.5 DAI and imaged 8days after induction when the fruit length had reached 2 or 4mm. The clones reflect growth at the end of the middle phase and the late phase and, at the time of induction, cell shapes could not be assumed to be isodiametric. For this reason, we did not analyse growth rates of clones during the late phase but focussed on clone shapes and distributions.. Fig. 6.Clonal analysis and modelling the late phase.

Coloured chart represents resultant growth rates (%/h). Scale bars: 250m in A,B,D,H,I,K; 500m in C,E,F,J,L.. The clone patterns in the style and replum are similar throughout the middle and late phases, being elongated parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fruit in both species. However, clone patterns in the valves in Capsella differ between the middle and late phase. Whereas middle phase clones are nearly isotropic (Fig.5Aiii), clones that grew during the late phase are highly anisotropic (Fig.6B,C). The orientation of late phase clones varies across the valves in Capsella, with clones near the base being elongated more along the longitudinal axis but clones in the middle and distal regions being elongated more diagonally (most clearly observed in Fig.6C). The clone patterns during the late phase therefore reveal a dynamic redistribution of anisotropic growth in the Capsella valves as the fruit undergoes the transition from oblate spheroid to a heart-shaped structure. By contrast, clone shapes and orientations in the valves of Arabidopsis remained similar between the middle and late phases (Fig.5Biii, Fig.6D,E).. A model of the late phase in Capsella needs to account for the shape change of the fruit and for the anisotropy and orientation of the clones. Continuing to grow the Capsella model to later stages with the same interactions as discussed above cannot account for these shape changes and clone patterns (Fig.S4). By contrast, when the Arabidopsis canvas continues to grow based on the interactions detailed in the middle phase, the resultant shapes and clone patterns resemble the observed fruit shapes and clone patterns of the same stages (Fig.6D,E,K,L). Additional growth interactions are therefore needed in the Capsella model to generate the heart shape, whereas the Arabidopsis model can remain the same in the middle and late phases.. The clone patterns suggest that the additional growth interactions needed in the Capsella fruit during the late phase differ for the proximal and distal regions. To distinguish the proximal region and the distal region we introduced two factors, GPROX and GDIST, which are distributed in opposing linear gradients in the valves (Fig.S5). These factors only influence growth rates after 8 DAI. Clones near the base are elongated more along the longitudinal axis, suggesting more growth parallel to the polarity. Therefore, GPROX promotes Kpar and inhibits Kper (Fig.6G). In the distal region, the polarity field curves to converge on the style (Fig.6F) and clones are elongated perpendicular to this polarity. We therefore postulated that GDIST inhibits Kpar (Fig.6G). These specified growth patterns create a conflict between the proximal region with relatively low Kper (and high Kpar) and the distal region with relatively high Kper (and low Kpar). A factor GMIDVALVE was introduced as a linear gradient in the midvalve region (Fig.S5). Similar to MIDVALVE in the middle phase, GMIDVALVE promotes Kpar to maintain the flattened cross-sectional shape. In addition, a factor APEX was introduced that inhibits Kpar specifically in the midvalve at the apex of the shoulders to prevent isotropic growth in the shoulder region (Fig.S5). The resultant shapes generated by the model are similar to those of the Capsella fruit at equivalent stages (Fig.6A-C,H-J). Consistent with the experimental data, virtual clones are elongated longitudinally in the proximal region and diagonally in the distal and middle regions (Fig.6H). As the canvas grows the virtual clones diverge increasingly towards the shoulders of the valve (Fig.6J). Overall, the model postulates a change in specified growth rates after the middle phase, with Kpar promoted near the base and Kper promoted in the distal regions, and this can account for the final fruit form and the clone patterns of the Capsella fruit during the late phase.. . . FRUITFULL modifies growth during the late phase. In Capsella during the late phase, growth patterns change from the middle phase to transform an oblate spheroid into a heart-shaped fruit. The model predicts that genetic factors active after 8 DAI will be important for generating the heart form. A gene known to be important at the later stages of fruit development in Arabidopsis is FRUITFULL (AtFUL), which encodes a member of the MADS-box transcription factor family (Gu et al., 1998). Mutations in AtFUL affect fruit growth, as valve cells fail to elongate after fertilisation (Ferrndiz et al., 2000). We identified a likely Capsella FUL orthologue (CrFUL) in the genome sequence of the diploid C. rubella (Slotte et al., 2013). To test whether this gene has a similar effect on growth at late stages of Capsella fruit development as observed in Arabidopsis, we set out to identify ful mutant alleles in Capsella. We generated a mutant population in C. rubella by EMS mutagenesis. This population formed the basis for both a forward genetic screen and a targeted induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) platform for reverse genetics. We screened mutant lines for fruit shape deformities and identified two mutants by forward genetic screening with a ful-like fruit phenotype. Mutations in the CrFUL gene in these two individuals were confirmed by sequencing and the effect of these mutations on the phenotype was confirmed by lack of complementation in F1 plants originating from crosses between the alleles (Fig.S6). These two alleles were named crful-1 and crful-2. A third allele, crful-3 was identified by TILLING and displayed a partial phenotype (Fig.S6). As in wild type, the gynoecium of crful-1 develops with an oblate spheroid shape before fertilisation, but with a longer style than wild-type gynoecia (Fig.7A-D). After fertilisation, when the shoulders develop in wild-type fruits, the crful-1 fruits remain rounded (Fig.7E,F). This rounded shape becomes slightly elongated but is retained at all subsequent stages of fruit development. This is consistent with the phenotype of ful mutant alleles in Arabidopsis, where gynoecia are largely indistinguishable from wild type until fertilisation (Fig.7G-J), and the phenotype only becomes clearly evident during post-fertilisation fruit growth (Fig.7K,L). These data show that CrFUL influences Capsella fruit shape mainly by modulating growth during the late phase.. Fig. 7.CrFUL is necessary for the late phase growth in Capsella and Arabidopsis.

(H,J,L) atful-2 at corresponding stages to wild type. Scale bars: 100m in A,B,G,H; 250m in C-F,I-L.. To test which factors in the model could represent the activities of FUL, we compared the phenotype of a weak crful mutant allele (crful-3) at two developmental stages with a model in which the activity of GDIST is removed and overall growth (Kpar and Kper) reduced (gdist mutant) (Fig.8). Similar to the crful-1 allele, crful-3 gynoecium forms an oblate spheroid shape before fertilisation (Fig.8A, Fig.S6), which is also observed at the end of the middle phase in gdist (Fig.8B). After fertilisation, the crful-3 fruit, like the wild type, develops a tapered base, but fails to generate the shoulders of the heart (Fig.8C). The shape of gdist in late phase broadly matches that of the crful-3 fruit (Fig.8D). However, one difference between crful-3 and gdist is the longer style of crful-3, which cannot be accounted for by simply removing GDIST from the model. This experiment suggests that GDIST and promotion of overall growth represents at least some of the activities of FUL during the late phase.. Fig. 8.CrFUL has overlapping activities with GDIST. (A,C) SEM images of crful-3 fruit before and after fertilisation. (B,D) Capsella model with GDIST removed (gdist) at corresponding stages. Models are shown for 8 DAI (B) and 14 DAI (D). Scale bars: 100m in B; 200m in A; 500m in C,D.. . . Varying regional growth rates can explain much of the fruit shape diversity in the Brassicaceae. To test if this model of fruit development can account for other fruit shapes in the Brassicaceae we simplified the model to consider each subregion in turn. Consider the simplest growth pattern: isotropic growth of a cylinder with reduced Kper in the style and base gives rise to a spherical form (Fig.S2). Spherical fruits are present in the Brassicaceae, such as Neslia paniculata (Francis and Warwick, 2003), broadly matching the characteristics of this simple model.. Another common fruit shape observed in the Brassicaceae is the oblate spheroid form, similar to the gynoecium of Capsella before fertilisation. This spheroid form can be flattened either laterally, as for mature fruits from Lepidium campestre, or medially, as for Alyssum maritimum mature fruits. We have already shown that when Kpar is relatively high in the midvalve (in Capsella) the model is flattened laterally (Fig.5Hii). We found that if we continued to grow the model with MPHASE rather than introducing LPHASE, the model broadly accounts for the shape of laterally flattened spheroid fruit such as in Ledipium (Fig.9A,B, Fig.S3). To test whether the replum could also be important for controlling fruit flatness, we promoted Kpar by REP. The resulting form is flattened medially (Fig.9C), with the replum tissue around the rim of a flattened spheroid, similar to the mature fruit of Alyssum (Fig.9D). Therefore, relative rates of Kpar in the midvalve or replum are important for controlling the flatness of the model to generate a spheroid shape. Overall, varying the model framework developed for Arabidopsis and Capsella fruits can account for at least basic fruit shape diversity in the Brassicaceae..

PMC3043248	Results. . Establishment of an experimental system in which nitrate and organic nitrogen can be varied independently of each other. Addition of nitrate to a plant alters the level of nitrate, the levels of downstream metabolites, and the rate of growth. Previous studies used genotypes with low or no NR activity to separate these responses. For studies of flowering, this approach has two disadvantages. First, although low-NR genotypes allow nitrate to be varied independently of downstream events, this is achieved against a background of low levels of N-containing metabolites and slow growth. To study flowering, it would be more appropriate to use a treatment that allows nitrate to be varied in the presence of high organic N, to avoid possible complications due to non-specific effects of slow growth per se. Second, it would be very tedious to screen the interaction between N and existing floral induction pathways in this genetic background, because this would require lengthy crossing programs to generate genotypes that are homozygous for multiple mutations or transgenes. For this reason, we explored whether glutamine supplementation can be used as an alternative approach. In this approach, the nitrate concentration is varied, while supplying glutamine as a constitutive source of N. Addition of 4mM glutamine to Arabidopsis growing on 0.2mM nitrate restored growth to above that seen on 10mM nitrate (data not shown). Other amino acids including asparagine, aspartate, glutamate and alanine were less effective (data not shown).. Figure2 summarizes the response when the Arabidopsis accession C24 is grown with 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine as a constitutive N source on nutrient agar in weak light in a 12h light/12h dark photoregime. The plants were visually scored each day for the presence of a flower bud. At the time when ca. 30% of the plants in a given treatment had started to flower, all plants with a flower bud were harvested for destructive analysis. The remaining plants were visually scored for flowering for the remainder of the experiment. Decreased nitrate led to flowering at an earlier time (Fig.2a), after producing fewer leaves (Fig.2b) and with a lower shoot fresh weight at the time of flowering (Fig.2c). Similar results were obtained for Laer (see Supplemental Fig. S1) and Col-0 (see below).Fig.2Influence of nitrate on the transition to flowering and metabolite levels in the Arabidopsis accession C24 grown with glutamine as a constitutive N source. Plants were grown on medium supplemented with 4mM glutamine and 1 (grey), 10 (red) or 35 (blue) mM nitrate, or on non-glutamine supplemented medium with 0.5 (yellow) or 10 (brown) mM nitrate, in a 12h light/12h dark photoperiod (120mumolm-2s-1) at 20C. The percentage of plants with a visible floral bud was scored each day after germination (a). On the day when about 30% of the plants had a visible floral bud, all plants with a floral bud were harvested. This corresponded to 22, 26 and 30days for plants on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate, respectively (the plant age at harvest is noted above). Key colours corresponding to the different treatments mentioned above are similar to panel a, but in this case it is necessary to differentiate between shoot (clear) and root (hatched) tissues. This material was analysed to determine leaf number (b), shoot fresh weight (FW, c) and root FW (not shown), from which the shoot/root ratio (d) was calculated. The shoots and roots were also analysed for nitrate (e), total amino acids (f), glucose (g), sucrose (h) and starch (i). Metabolite levels in the shoot and root are shown as plain and hatched bars, respectively. The results are the meanSE of 10-15 individual plants per treatment. Total plant fresh weight when ca. 30% of the plants had started to flower was 187, 325 and 554mg for plants growing on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate (Fig.2c, data not shown). This corresponded to day 22, 26 and 30 after germination, respectively. Based on the total plant weight and a seed weight of 0.025mg, and assuming exponential growth over the life cycle of the plant, we estimated an average relative growth rate of about 0.24, 0.22 and 0.21 on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate, respectively. This provides direct evidence that inclusion of glutamine in the medium largely reverses the inhibition of growth in low nitrate. The shoot/root ratio typically decreases in low N, because root growth is inhibited less strongly than shoot growth. It is known that this response is regulated by nitrate. This decrease of the shoot/root ratio occurred when nitrate was decreased in the presence of glutamine (Fig.2d).. Metabolites were measured in the shoot and roots as flowering commenced. Low nitrate in the medium led to a decrease of the internal nitrate pool (Fig.2e), and a general increase of amino acids (Fig.2f). The latter was partly due to an increase of glutamine, but analyses of the amino acid composition revealed that the levels of most other amino acids were unaltered or increased slightly in low nitrate (data not shown). There was also a small increase in the levels of glucose (Fig.2g), fructose (not shown), sucrose (Fig.2h) and starch (Fig.2i), compared to plants grown on higher nitrate.. For comparison, C24 was also grown with 0.5 and 10mM nitrate in the absence of glutamine (right hand side of the panels in Fig.2). In these conditions, low nitrate did not lead to earlier flowering with respect to time (Fig.2a), but it did lead to earlier flowering when this is related to leaf number or shoot weight basis (Fig.2b, c). The acceleration of flowering by low nitrate is masked when flowering is scored on a time basis, because growth is much slower. The impact of external nitrate on internal nitrate levels was similar to that seen in the presence of glutamine (Fig.2e). The levels of amino acids were lower than in the presence of glutamine, and decreased slightly in low nitrate. The levels of carbohydrates in low nitrate were much higher in the absence of glutamine. This is probably due to the very slow rate of growth in these conditions.. . . Interaction of nitrate with the photoperiod. Figure3 shows a more extensive experiment in which the accession Col-0 was grown in long (16/8), neutral (12/12) or short (8/16) day conditions in the presence of 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate on glutamine-supplemented medium. As in the experiment of Fig.2, when circa 30% of the plants in a given treatment had floral buds these plants were harvested for further analyses, and the remaining plants were scored visually for the remainder of the experiment. The times of harvest are noted in the legend of Fig.3.Fig.3Influence of nitrate on the transition to flowering and metabolite levels in the Arabidopsis accession Col-0 grown with glutamine as a constitutive N source in long, neutral and short-day conditions. Plants were grown on 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine, at 20C and a light intensity of (120mumolm-2s-1) in a 16h light/8h dark, 12h light/12h dark or 8h light/16h dark photoregime (long, neutral and short days, respectively). The percentage of plants with a visible floral bud was scored each day after germination (a). On the day when about 30% of the plants had a visible floral bud, all plants with a floral bud were harvested. This was after 22days for all plants growing in a 16/8 cycle, after 27, 33 and 37days for plants growing in a 12/12 cycle on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate, respectively, and after 75, 82 and 116days for plants growing in a 8/16 cycle in 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate. This material was used to determine leaf number (b), shoot FW at the transition to flowering (c), the shoot/root ratio (d), nitrate (e), total amino acids (f), glucose (g), sucrose (h) and starch (i). For details and colour scheme, see the legend to Fig.2. The results are the meanSE of 10-15 individual plants per treatment. As expected, on high nitrate flowering occurred earlier in long-day conditions than in neutral or short-day conditions (Fig.3a). Low nitrate did not alter the flowering time in long days, but led to earlier flowering in neutral conditions, and under short-day conditions, flowering was more rapid in nitrate-limiting conditions (Fig.3a). Leaf number and shoot biomass at flowering were unaffected by nitrate in long days, but were decreased by low nitrate in neutral and short days (Fig.3b, c). The shoot/root ratio decreased in low nitrate, especially in neutral and short-day conditions (Fig.3d).. Using the procedure outlined above, we estimated that plants growing on 1, 10 and 35mM nitrate had average relative growth rates of 0.21, 0.24 and 0.23 in a 16/8 cycle, 0.21, 0.18 and 0.17 in a 12/12 cycle, and 0.085, 0.082 and 0.063 in a 8/16 cycle. Thus, inclusion of glutamine in the medium reverses the inhibition of growth of Col-0 in low nitrate, as already seen for C24.. Analyses of plants harvested when flowering was just starting in each treatment showed that internal nitrate fell to low levels in the 1mM nitrate treatment in all of the photoperiod regimes, and remained high in the 10 and 35mM nitrate treatments in all three photoperiod regimes (Fig.3e). The differential response of flowering to nitrate in the three photoperiods is therefore not due to day-length-dependent changes of internal nitrate. The trend to slightly increased levels of amino acids (Fig.3f) and increased levels of carbohydrates (Fig.3g-i) in low nitrate noted for C24 is confirmed in Col-0. This trend is seen in all three photoregimes. As expected, carbohydrates were lower in short days than in neutral or long-day conditions. Amino acids were also lower; this may be due to a restriction on nitrogen metabolism due to a lower supply of carbon in short-day conditions (Matt et al. 1998).. . . Influence of nitrate on flowering in mutants in known floral induction pathways. Figure4 summarizes a set of experiments with mutants and transgenic plants altered in the activity of the autonomous, GA, photoperiod or vernalization floral induction pathways, and with transgenic plants with lesions that affect the floral integrators. All these experiments were carried out in a 12h light/12h dark photoregime, with plants growing on nutrient medium supplemented with 4mM glutamine and provided with 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate. Some of the mutants are in the Laer background, and some in the Col-0 background (see legend). Both wild types show a weak response to nitrate in these conditions. The complete data set is provided in the supplemental material (Supplemental Table S1).Fig.4Summary of the response of flowering to nitrate in mutants in the floral induction pathways and the floral integrators. The percentage of plants with a visible floral bud was scored each day after germination and, in order to get an overview of the flowering time for the different genotypes, the time at which 30% of the plants induced to flower is represented as the meanSD. All genotypes were grown on 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine as a constitutive N source in a 12h light/12h dark (ca. 120mumolm-2s-1) at 20C. a Autonomous pathway (fwa-1, fve-1, fy-1; see supplemental Fig. S2 for the original data), b gibberellic acid pathway (gai, ga1-3; see Supplemental Fig. S3 for the original data), c photoperiod pathway (35S::CO, co2 tt4; see Fig.5 for the original data), d constitutive overexpression of FLC (35S::FLC), e the fca co2 ga1-1 triple mutant (see Fig.6) and floral integrators lying downstream or CO and FLC (ft-7,soc1-1, ft-7 soc1-1, fd-1, lfy, tfl-1; see Fig.5; supplemental Fig. S2 for the original data). The wild-type background was Laer for all the mutants. The response in wild-type Laer and wild-type Col-0 is shown for comparison. All experiments were performed with 11-22 individual plants per treatment. Open circle means that no plant showed floral bud in that condition. Response to different nitrate concentrations was analysed for each genotype (*P<0.05, determined with one-way ANOVA for independent samples). **Pairwise significant differences between means (relative to wild-type Laer) determined with one-way ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison test (Tukeys honestly significant difference test). As expected, flowering was delayed in mutants in the autonomous pathway (fwa-1, fve-1, fy-1) (Fig.4a, see Supplemental Fig. S2 for more data) and a CONSTANS knock-out mutant (co-2 tt4) (Fig.4c, see also Fig.5c) compared to the corresponding wild type. Mutants in the GA pathway (gai, ga1-3) (Fig.4b, see Supplemental Fig. S3 for more data) only showed a tendency. The co-2 mutant that was used carries the transparent testa4 (tt4) mutation (Putterill et al. 1995; Onouchi et al. 2000). This causes a white seed colour phenotype and was used as a visible marker to indicate the presence of the co2 mutation, but should not affect flowering time. These mutants showed a clear tendency to flower more rapid in low nitrate. This response was retained but not strengthened in the GA-pathway mutants. The response to nitrate was significant in the autonomous pathway mutants fwa-1, fy-1, where it was more marked than in the corresponding wild type.Fig.5Response to nitrate in mutants in the photoperiod pathway, and in floral integrators lying downstream of this pathway. All genotypes were grown on 1, 10 or 35mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine as a constitutive N source in a 12h light/12h dark (ca. 120mumolm-2s-1) at 20C. a Laer wild-type, b35S::CO, cco2 tt4, dsoc1-1, eft-7 and fft-7 soc1-1 double mutant. All experiments were performed with 11-22 individual plants per treatment. For colour scheme, see Fig.2. The triple mutant fca1 co-2 ga1-3 is compromised in photoperiod, autonomous and GA-dependent flowering, and does not flower under either short- or long-day conditions (Reeves and Coupland 2001). No floral buds were seen when this triple mutant was grown for up to 90days in the presence of 35mM nitrate (Figs.4d, 6). Strikingly, flowering occurred after ca. 75 and 50 when nitrate was decreased to 10 and 1mM, respectively.Fig.6Response to nitrate in the fca co2 ga1-3 triple mutant. The triple mutant was grown on 1 (grey circle), 10 (red triangle) or 35 (blue square) mM nitrate in the presence of 4mM glutamine as a constitutive N source in a 12h light/12h dark (ca. 120mumolm-2s-1) at 20C. 12-15 individual plants were used per treatment. The response in wild-type Laer is shown in Fig.5a. The experiment was performed three times with similar results. For colour scheme, see Fig.2. The photoperiod, GA and autonomous pathways act by inducing floral integrators like FT, FD,SOC1, TFL and LFY (Fig.1). FD and SOC1 have been implicated in the signalling pathway downstream of FT, while TFL is thought to antagonise LFY. Low nitrate accelerated flowering in ft-7,fd-1, lfy, and tfl-1 single mutants (Figs.4e, 5). The only exception was soc1-1, where flowering was hardly delayed. The latter experiment was repeated three times (Figs.4e, 5). Flowering was strongly delayed in the ft-7 soc1-1 double mutant (Figs.4e, 5). The response to nitrate was qualitatively stronger after repressing some of these floral integrators, including ft-7 single mutant and the ft-7 soc1-1 double mutant. These results suggest low nitrate promotes flowering via a mechanism that operates independently of the photoperiod, GA and autonomous floral induction pathways, and that enters downstream of the known floral integrators.. The finding that the response to nitrate is stronger in co-2 tt4, the ft-7 soc1-1 double mutant and the fca1 co-2 ga1-3 triple mutant could be explained if nitrate acts in parallel with other signalling pathways, and its impact can be more clearly detected when their pathways are inhibited. In this case, constitutive activation of other floral induction pathways should override the effect of low nitrate. As already noted, nitrate has a strong impact on flowering time in short days, but little effect in long days when the photoperiod pathway is activated. This indicates that nitrate acts in parallel to and is redundant with the photoperiod pathway. Flowering is also independent of the nitrate supply in 35S::CO mutants, where the photoperiod pathway is constitutively activated (Fig.5b). The autonomous pathway and the vernalisation pathways both act by repressing FLC (Fig.1). The interaction of nitrate with these pathways was investigated in 35S::FLC mutants, which have constitutive overexpression of FLC and strongly delayed flowering. The response to nitrate was abolished in 35S::FLC mutants (Fig.4d).. Summarizing, the promotion of flowering by low nitrate becomes more marked when the other signalling pathways are attenuated or inhibited, but is blocked by constitutive overexpression of FLC. These observations are consistent with the idea that nitrate modulates flowering time via a pathway that acts in parallel with the autonomous, photoperiod and GA pathways, that enters downstream of the known floral integrators, but is repressed by FLC.. . . Response to low phosphate. To investigate whether other nutrients modulate flowering via a similar mechanism to nitrate, wild-type Laer and the fca1 co-2 ga1-3 triple mutant were grown in the presence of excess (3mM) and limiting (0.2mM) phosphate (Fig.7). Low phosphate led to earlier flowering in wild-type Laer (Fig.7a). Flowering in the triple mutant was suppressed for at least 75days in high phosphate (plants never flowered), but was initiated after 30-50days in 0.2mM phosphate (Fig.7b).Fig.7Response of flowering time to low phosphate. a Laer, wild type grown on 1mM KNO3 (n=14), 35mM KNO3 (n=22) or 0.2mM KH2PO4 (n=41). bfca co2 ga1-3 triple mutant on 1mM KNO3 (n=15), 35mM KNO3 (n=14) or 0.2mM KH2PO4 (n=48). Treatments of 1mM and 35mM KNO3 contained 3mM phosphate, so that, were used for comparison to the 0.2mM phosphate treatment. All mediums were supplemented with 4mM glutamine. Plants were grown in a 12h light/12h dark photoperiod at 20 C day/night and 12h of light period. . . Response to abiotic stresses. General stress can also lead to early flowering. To provide further evidence that low nitrate does not act via a general stress pathway, we investigated whether abiotic stresses can trigger flowering in the fca1 co-2 ga1-3 triple mutant (Fig.8). High light (Fig.8a), high temperature (Fig.8b), photochilling (Fig.8c) and continuous light treatments (Fig.8d) lead to earlier flowering in wild-type Laer. Except for photochilling, the effect was similar to or larger than the effect of nitrate in wild-type plants (see e.g., Fig.5a). None of these treatments induced flowering in the triple mutant.Fig.8Response of flowering time to abiotic stress in wild-type Laer and the fca co2 ga1-3, triple mutant.

Radicle emergence (Fig. 1B) and fresh weight (Fig. 1C) of Arabidopsis HO gain- and loss-of-function mutants (Fig. 1A) were assessed under 100mM and 50mM NaCl stress, respectively. As expected, HO gain-of-function mutants (35s:HY1-1/2/4) showed the highest percentage (55-100%) of radicle emergence, compared with <20% in HO loss-of-function mutants (hy1-100, ho2, and ho3) (Fig. 1B). A similar trend was observed for fresh weight data, with overexpressing lines having fresh weight in the range of 0.22-0.28g per pot at 50mM NaCl stress compared with 0.07-0.16g per pot for knockout lines (Fig. 1C). In both cases, the wild-type Col-0 plants were in between these two groups (22% radicle emergence and 0.17g of fresh weight per pot).. . . HO induces H+ efflux and improves K+ retention during salinity stress. Salinity stress (100mM NaCl) caused significant changes in the transport of H+ (Figs 2, 3) and K+ (Fig. 4) ions in both the mature and elongation root zones of all the Arabidopsis genotypes tested.. .

Application of acute salt stress induced significant H+ efflux from all the genotypes tested. However, salt-induced H+ efflux was least in HO loss-of-function mutants (hy1-100, ho2, and ho3) when compared with the wild type and HO gain-of-function mutants (35s:HY1-1/2/4) (Fig. 2).. Given the qualitative similarity of both ion flux (Fig. 2) and growth (Fig. 1) responses within the two groups, one HO-overexpressing (35s:HY1-4) and one knockout (hy1-100) line were selected for further studies. Similar to the mature zone, salinity treatment caused the highest net H+ efflux from the elongation root zone of HO gain-of-function mutant 35s:HY1-4 when compared with the wild type and the HO knockout mutant (hy1-100) (Fig. 3). Pre-treating seedling of the 35s:HY1-4 mutant with P-type H+-ATPase inhibitor (1mM sodium orthovanadate) resulted in the abolishment of salt-induced H+ efflux in this mutant (Fig. 4A), indicating that the observed HO-induced stimulation of net H+ efflux was mediated by a P-type H+-ATPase.. Similar to previous observations (e.g. Shabala et al., 2005, 2006), 100mM NaCl induced K+ efflux from the mature and elongation zone of intact Arabidopsis roots (Fig. 5). Peak K+ efflux was measured between 2min and 5min after salt application. After reaching peak K+ efflux, the K+ flux recovered gradually but not fully. Moreover, the salinity-induced peak K+ efflux measured at the elongation zone was at least 10-fold higher than at the mature root zone. The above result confirmed that the root elongation zone is more sensitive to salt treatment than the mature root zone. In both root zones, the HO gain-of-function mutant 35s:HY1-4 recorded the least K+ efflux, followed by the wild type, while the highest K+ efflux was measured in the HO knockout mutant (hy1-100) (Fig. 5). Better K+ retention in the 35s:HY1-4 mutant was partly reversed (Fig. 4B) by sodium orthovanadate (P-type H+-ATPase inhibitor) pre-treatment, suggesting that a substantial part of the K+ retention through HO overexpression may be attributed to increased plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity.. .

(C) Average K+ extrusion during 1h of 100mM NaCl stress. Each point or bar represents the meanSE (n=6-9 seedlings). In C, bars sharing common letters are not significantly different by LSD test at P  0.05. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . . . HO increases the rate of plasma membrane repolarization during salinity stress. No significant difference in E. m values was found in the root elongation zone among genotypes (35s:HY1-4, wild type, and hy1-100) under control conditions (-1324 mV; Fig. 6). Adding 100mM NaCl to the bath depolarized the E. m values to -222 mV within 1.5min of salt application in all genotypes. However, the rate of E. m repolarization was significantly more pronounced in the HO gain-of-function mutant 35s:HY1-4, followed by the wild type. E. m values remained the least negative (most depolarized) in the HO loss-of-function mutant hy1-100 (Fig. 6). Fifteen minutes after NaCl treatment, E. m values of the 35s:HY1-4 mutant repolarized to -543.2 mV, but only to -312 mV in the hy1-100 mutant. The E. m values of the wild-type plants were between those of the 35s:HY1-4 and hy1-100 mutants (-412 mV).. . Fig. 6. . .

Each point or bar represents the mean SE (n=6-9 seedlings).. . . . . . HO up-regulates the relative expression of plasma membrane SOS1 and AHA1/2/3. . The activity of the plasma membrane H+ATPase is essential not only for the maintenance of negative membrane potential under saline conditions but also to provide a driving force for Na+ exclusion via the Na+/H+ exchanger (SOS1). Hence, relative gene expression of SOS1 and AHA1/2/3 was quantified at three time points (0, 12, and 24h) after application of 100mM NaCl to roots (Fig. 7). The SOS1 expression was increased 5- and 10-fold in the 35s:HY1-4 mutant after 12h and 24h of salt application, respectively. Alhough the wild type also showed an increase in SOS1 expression, the expression level remained within 2- to 4-fold. In contrast, SOS1 expression remained unchanged in the hy1-100 mutant.. . Fig. 7. . . Effect of 100mM NaCl treatment on relative SOS1 and AHA1/2/3 expression measured in roots of 4- to 5-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings. Each bar represents the mean SE (n=6-9 seedlings for each treatment and time combination obtained in three independent trials).. . . . The relative expression levels of AHA1/2 peaked at 12h, whereas AHA3 expression peaked 24h after salt application in the 35s:HY1-4 mutant. Alhough the wild type showed a similar trend, the expression levels were smaller than in the 35s:HY1-4 mutant. Interestingly, AHA1/2/3 expression levels gradually decreased during salt treatment in the hy1-100 mutant. The above results confirm the role of HO in the functioning of AHAs and SOS1 as Na+ exclusion mechanisms in plants..
PMC3162137	Results. . Regenerant Arabidopsis Lineages Display Somaclonal Variation. Arabidopsis is a genetic model plant with a condensed genome (120 Mb). We reasoned that analysis of regenerant Arabidopsis plant genomes at single-base resolution might reveal genetic changes conferring somaclonal variation. Invitro regeneration of Arabidopsis is achieved via two-stage culture of root explants [8]. First, a pluripotent cell mass (callus) forms via activation of a lateral root genetic developmental program in pericycle cells of explants grown on auxin-rich medium [9, 10]. Subsequently, shoots or roots develop from callus grown on media containing specific auxin:cytokinin concentration ratios. The de novo induction of shoot meristems from small clusters of progenitor callus cells [11] leads eventually to the regeneration of an entire plant.. We first determined whether regenerant Arabidopsis lineages display heritable phenotypic somaclonal variation comparable with that seen in other species. Twenty-eight (R0) plants were regenerated from explants from a single Arabidopsis (Columbia laboratory strain; Col-0) root [8] (Figure1A), and phenotypic variation was assessed in resultant self-pollination generated (R1) families (Figures 1A-1C; see also FigureS1 available online). Variant phenotypes were detected in 8 of the 28 lineages (Figures 1B and 1C; see also Table S1). Two of these phenotypes were not stably heritable (Figure1B; see also FigureS1 and Table S1) and probably were conferred by unstable epigenetic change. In six further cases, phenotypes were stably heritable and segregated within R1 families, with segregation ratios approximating to Mendelian expectations for single-gene recessive mutations that had been heterozygous in the preceding R0 plant (Figure1B; see also Table S1; data not shown). Thus invitro regeneration of Arabidopsis plants results in a high frequency of heritable phenotypic variation and provides a general model for the study of plant somaclonal variation.. . . Regenerant Arabidopsis Lineages Display a Characteristic Spectrum of Genome-wide DNA Sequence Mutation. We reasoned that the somaclonal variation exhibited by regenerant Arabidopsis lineages might be associated with an increase in genomic DNA sequence mutation. We therefore next determined the genome-wide extent and molecular spectrum of DNA sequence mutations in regenerant Arabidopsis lineages, using 76 base pair paired-end Illumina next-generation DNA sequencing (Figures 2A-2E). DNA samples from the progenitor P1 plant (Figure1A; progenitor genome) and from five individual R1 plants (Figure1A; regenerant genomes) were sequenced to a coverage depth of between 22 and 30 per sample (FigureS2A). For each sample, high-quality uniquely mapped reads covered 116 million of the 120 million base pairs of the Col-0 TAIR9 reference genome (see Experimental Procedures), and most uncovered regions were located either in centromeres or telomeres (Figures S2A and S2B; Experimental Procedures). We detected 152 novel regenerant single-base substitution (SBSs) and short insertion or deletion (indel) mutations in R1 plants (mutations not present in the P1 progenitor) using a scheme summarized in FigureS2C. In addition, because previous work showed that somaclonal variation can be associated with larger-scale indels and chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., [12]), we exploited the paired-end property of Illumina Genome Analyzer data to detect such larger-scale events in R1plants (see Experimental Procedures; Figures S2E-S2K). Despite exhaustive searches, no large indels or gross chromosomal abnormalities were detected in any of the five R1 plants representing regenerant Arabidopsis lineages.. The 152 regenerant DNA sequence mutations comprised 131 SBSs and 21 small indels (2bp) (Detected mutations in Figures 2A and 2B; Table S2A). Sample sets of detected SBSs and indels were confirmed by capillary sequencing (see Experimental Procedures). Regenerant mutations were apparently evenly spread between chromosomes (Figure2A; see also FigureS2L). These de novo mutations would have been heterozygous when they first arose and would hence have had a 25% chance of being homozygous in individual R1 plants of the subsequent (self-pollination generated) generation. Because we were detecting homozygous mutations only (see Experimental Procedures and FigureS2C), and because we expected that only 25% of regenerant mutations would have become homozygous in the R1 generation, we accordingly estimated the actual number of regenerant mutations by multiplying the detected mutations by four (Theoretical mutations in Figure2B). We hence derive somaclonal mutation frequencies of between 4.2 10-7 and 24.2 10-7 mutations per site in the five regenerant lineages (Figure2B; see Experimental Procedures). The mutation rate thus increased between 60 and 350 in the regenerant lineages versus the background spontaneous mutation rate observed in sexually propagated Arabidopsis (7 10-9 mutations per site per generation [13]).. SBSs are the most common category of regenerant mutation (Figures 2B and 2C). However, the ratio of regenerant transitions:transversions (63:68= 0.92) is very different to that (2.41) seen in sexually propagated plants [13], as are the relative frequencies (molecular spectrum) of individual base substitution classes (Figure2D; see also Figures S2M-S2P). In addition, regenerant plants carried an elevated frequency of indel mutations (Figure2E). Intriguingly, nearly all regenerant indels occurred in homopolymeric or polydinucleotide stretches, which is not the case for small indels arising spontaneously in sexually propagated plants [13] (Figure2E; Figures S2Q and S2R; see also Table S2B). Short read next-generation sequencing is relatively poor at reporting indels in simple sequence repeat regions (for further discussion see [13]), which might explain why the small indel mutation rates we determined are less than those previously determined bya different method for sexually propagated plants [14]. Nevertheless, our results show an increased frequency of small indels in regenerant plants at those sites we were able to assay (Table S2B; Figures S2Q and S2R). In summary, the overall distinctiveness of the regenerant mutational molecular spectrum (SBSs and indels) implies that the elevation in mutation frequency observed in regenerant plants cannot simply be attributed to an accelerated accumulation of the same kinds of mutations as arise spontaneously in sexually propagated plants.. . . Regenerant Base Substitution Mutations Confer Somaclonal Variant Phenotypes. Of 29 regenerant SBSs affecting protein-coding sequence, 17 were nonsynonymous mutations that alter the amino acid sequence of proteins (Figure2C; Table S2A). In contrast, none of the indels affected protein-coding sequence (Figure2C), suggesting that SBSs may be a major genetic cause of somaclonal variation. Indeed, one of the five genome-wide sequenced R1 plants, R1-19-2, carries a protein-truncating SBS in Cullin 3A (a locus at which mutant alleles confer late flowering [15]), and a late-flowering phenotype was indeed conferred by this SBS (Figures 3A and 3B). Further genetic complementation and molecular analysis of additional regenerant lines displaying long hypocotyl (R2-17-1; Figures 3C and 3D; FigureS3A) and late flowering (R2-6-3; Figures 3E and 3F; FigureS3B) phenotypes established that they respectively carried novel mutant HY1 (mutant alleles confer an elongated hypocotyl [16]) and FKF1 (mutant alleles confer late flowering [17]) alleles. Capillary sequencing of these mutant alleles identified nonsynonymous SBS mutations in the protein-encoding sequences of HY1 (Figure3D) and FKF1 (Figure3F). While a previous report identifies base substitution mutation as a source of regeneration-associated phenotypic change [18], our findings demonstrate that such mutations are actually a major contributor to somaclonal variation.. . . Transposed Mobile Genetic Elements Not Detected in Sampled Regenerant Arabidopsis Lineages. The Arabidopsis genome contains multiple mobile genetic elements (transposons), whose activity is normally held in check by DNA methylation and associated epigenetic regulation [19, 20]. Because increased transposon activity has been linked to DNA sequence mutations in rice (Oryza sativa) tissue culture [21], we next sought to detect transposed transposons in regenerant Arabidopsis lineages, with depth of read coverage as a measure of the increased copy number caused by transposon amplification (see Experimental Procedures). Comparative analysis of the read coverage representation of CACTA, COPIA, gypsy, hAT, non-LTR, and other transposon classes (representative of 3,321 A.thaliana transposons, retrotransposons, and other putative mobile elements; Table S3) in whole-genome sequence data from the five R1 regenerant plants and from an epigenetically compromised positive control met1/+ nrpd2 mutant line (versus P1 data) revealed only the previously described novel AtCOPIA93 retrotransposition in met1/+ nrpd2 [20] and no detectable novel transposon amplification in any of the regenerant lines (Figure4; FigureS4). A second strategy for detection of novel transposon insertions in regenerant lines also detected nothing (see Experimental Procedures). We conclude that insertion of transposons into genes is unlikely to contribute significantly to the genetic variation underlying somaclonal phenotypic variation in regenerent Arabidopsis plants..
PMC4807768	Results. . MiP1a and miP1b are microProteins that contain a B-Box motif and interact with the flowering time regulator CONSTANS. The Arabidopsis genome contains 32 genes encoding proteins containing B-Box motifs (also called BBX proteins) [24]. Phylogenetic analysis of all Arabidopsis B-Box proteins reveals that miP1a and miP1b, are closely related to each other but cluster with both CONSTANS / CONSTANS-like proteins (S3A Fig). Interestingly, both microProtein genes are physically located in the direct vicinity of COL genes. These findings suggest that miP1a/b genes evolved during one of the genome-amplification events (whole genome duplication or tandem duplication), which enlarged the COL gene family (S3B Fig). Alignment of all COL B-Box domains with the B-Box domains of miP1a/b reveals that miP1a/b have one full B-Box domain and remnants of a second B-Box-domain (S3C and S3E Fig). Using structural modeling, we modeled the three-dimensional protein conformation of CO, COL6 and miP1a. These structures suggest that COL6 is more distant to CO and miP1a, which when superimposed show high degrees of structural similarities in the first B-Box domain (S3D Fig). An alignment of all COL proteins and miP1a/b further corroborates this finding and shows that critical cysteine and histidine residues of the second B-Box are also conserved in miP1a/b. These findings point towards a role of miP1a/b as potential interaction partners of COL proteins.. Based on the structure of the B-Box domains of both miP1a/b and CO, we postulated that miP1a/b function by forming heterodimeric complexes, that sequester CO/CO-like (COL) proteins into non-functional complexes. To test whether CO physically interacts with miP1a/b, we performed directed yeast-two-hybrid studies. The coding sequences of CO and the B-Boxes of CO were fused in frame to the Gal4-activation domain (AD; pGADT7) and used as prey. The prey proteins were tested in yeast against the empty pGBKT7 vector expressing the Gal4-DNA binding domain (BD) and in frame fusions of miP1a, miP1b and miP1a*, miP1a* being a protein in which all cysteine and histidine residues of the B-Box were mutated to alanine to prevent dimerization. We observed that CO and the CO B-Box-domain are able to interact with both miP1a and miP1b in yeast (Fig 1A). As predicted, no interaction was observed with the miP1a* protein, confirming that an intact zinc finger B-Box is essential for this interaction.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005959.g001. Fig 1. . The miP1a/b microProteins physically interact with CONSTANS via the B-Box domain.. (A) Yeast-two-hybrid interactions were tested by transforming fusions of either CO or the CO B-Box domain (COBB) to the Gal4 activation domain (AD) and fusions of miP1a/b/a* to the Gal4 binding domain (BD). Growth of serial dilutions on non-selective SD-medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (-L/-W) show normal yeast growth. Only positive interactors are able to grow on restrictive growth medium supplemented with 10mM 3-Aminotriazole (3-AT) and lacking histidine. (B) In vitro pull-down experiments. Recombinant MBP-CO, GST-miP1a and GST-ZPR3 proteins were produced in E. coli. After lysis, cell extracts of either MBP-CO and GST-ZPR3 or MBP-CO and GST-miP1b were mixed and incubated with magnetic amylose beads (NEB). MBP-CO complexes were precipitated and washed using a magnetic stand, eluted by boiling in SDS-loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting. (C) Transient co-expression of fluorescently labeled proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. GFP:CO localizes to sub-nuclear speckles and in the case of co-transformation with RFP:miP1a and RFP:miP1b, co-localization in speckles is observed. FLIM images show significant changes in the life-time of GFP when functional microProteins are co-transformed. GFP life-times of co-transformations of RFP:miP1a* resemble the RFP controls.. . . . To verify that the interactions of miP1a/b with CO, which were initially observed in yeast, can also occur in a different system, we tested if miP1a and CO expressed and purified from E. coli cells, can be co-immunoprecipitated. We expressed fusions of CO to the maltose binding protein (MBP) and fusions of miP1a to the glutathion-S-transferase tag (GST). As a negative control we fused the LITTLE ZIPPER3 (ZPR3) protein, a small leucine-zipper microProtein to GST-tag. All fusion proteins were expressed under the inducible T7 promoter in E. coli BL21 cells. After cell lysis, soluble protein fractions of either GST-miP1a and MBP-CO or GST-ZPR3 and MBP-CO were mixed and incubated with amylose-coated magnetic beads. After precipitation and washing, immune complexes were released by boiling in SDS-loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. CO was able to physically interact with the miP1a microProtein (Fig 1B) whereas no binding of GST-ZPR3 to MBP-CO was observed (Fig 1B). This further supports the idea that miP1-type microProteins act by binding to the CO protein and that this binding does not require other accessory proteins.. Potential inhibition of CO by miP1a/b could either be as a result of preventing the CO protein from entering the nucleus, or by attenuating DNA-binding of CO. To determine if miP1a/b can retain CO in the cytoplasm, we transiently co-transformed tobacco leaves with fusions of CO to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and fusions of miP1a, miP1b and miP1a* to the red fluorescent protein (RFP). We observe that both miP1a and CO and miP1b and CO co-localize in the same sub-nuclear structures (Fig 1C). Little fluorescence is observed in the cytoplasm, excluding the possibility that miP1a/b act by preventing nuclear import of CO. To test whether CO and miP1a/b also physically interact in planta, we performed FRET/FLIM experiments and detected significant lifetime changes of the GFP fluorophore in the speckles in which CO and miP1a/b co-localize (Fig 1C and S4 Fig). No significant lifetime changes were observed in nuclei co-expressing free RFP or RFP-miP1a*. Taken together, these results demonstrate that miP1a/b and CO are able to physically interact in planta through their B-Box domains and that these interactions do not inhibit nuclear localization of CO.. . . Overexpression of either miP1a or miP1b delays flowering under inductive long day conditions. To experimentally test the hypothesis that overexpression of miP1-type microProteins would have a dominant-negative effect on its predicted target CO we overexpressed the miP1a and miP1b genes. The coding sequences of miP1a/b were isolated by PCR and recombined in the pJAN33 vector [26] harboring a tandem-CaMV35S promoter for high-level ectopic overexpression. For each construct (pJAN33-miP1a and pJAN33-miP1b), we isolated (15 and 25 respectively) individual T1 transgenic lines that showed resistance to the herbicide BASTA respectively. The majority (about 80%) of the recovered transgenic plants showed severely delayed flowering when grown in long day conditions. To exclude an effect of the herbicide BASTA, we selected three independent homozygote transgenic lines and tested the flowering behavior under controlled inductive long day conditions. This analysis revealed that the transition to flowering of transgenic microProtein-overexpression plants is extremely compromised under inductive long-day condition when compared to wild type Col-0 plants (Fig 2A and 2B). Interestingly, the CO locus produces an alternatively spliced transcript, which could potentially produce a protein with only the B-Box domains. Overexpression of this CO splice variant (COBB) resulted in a similar late flowering phenotype. Furthermore, overexpression of miP1a/b and COBB caused a severe decrease in the levels of FT mRNA in leaves of long day grown plants (Fig 2C), explaining the molecular nature of the observed late flowering phenotypes. Phenotypically and molecularly, miP1a/b overexpression plants strongly resemble plants carrying loss-of-function mutations in either the CO or FT gene. These findings support our predictions and indicate that ectopic expression of miP1-type microProteins renders CO non-functional, resulting in attenuation of FT expression, which seems causal for the observed late flowering phenotypes. Overexpression of the mutant miP1a* protein does not cause an alteration in the flowering behavior of transgenic plants (S5 Fig), indicating that a functional zinc-finger B-Box domain is required for the observed late flowering phenotype of miP1a. Overexpression of COBB, miP1a or miP1b did also not cause flowering time changes when transgenic plants were grown under short day conditions (S6 Fig). Since CO is inactive in short days, our findings suggest that the most likely mode of miP1a/b action is rendering CO inactive in long day conditions and further suggest that miP1a/b affect CO and not other flowering-promoting factors. Further support that miP1a/b act through CO is provided by the finding that ectopic application of the flowering promoting hormone gibberellic acid (GA) induces flowering in mip1a/b-OX transgenic plants to the same extend as in co mutant plants (S7 Fig). These findings indicate that the two microProteins do not affect the autonomous regulatory pathway and other meristem factors that can be induced by GA [27].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005959.g002.

(F) Quantification of transcript levels by qRT-PCR shows that miP1b mRNA expression levels are significantly reduced in 35S::MIGS-miP1b transgenic plants while FT mRNA levels are slightly increased. In 35S::MIGS-miP1ab transgenic plants expression levels of both miP1 and miP1b mRNA are strongly reduced compared to Col-0 wild type plants while FT mRNA levels are slightly increased.. . . . Finally, co loss-of function mutants with ectopic miP1a expression (co miP1a-OX) are indistinguishable from either miP1a-OX or co mutant plants in their flowering behavior (S8 Fig), implying that CO is required for the flower attenuating effect of miP1a and that miP1a/b do not function by controlling other pathways.. . . Specificity of the interaction of miP1a/b with CONSTANS. Both miP1a and miP1b proteins have a B-Box zinc finger domain allowing them to interact with CONSTANS and potentially with the many other proteins containing a similar B-Box domain (B-Box proteins, BBX proteins). To further investigate the possible use of B-Box proteins as modulators of flowering time, we overexpressed B-Box proteins of group II (COL9), group III (COL16) and group IV (STO); we also included artificial microProtein versions (COL9miP, COL16miP, STOmiP) encoding only the respective B-Box domains. The initial analysis of T1 transgenic plants revealed that none of these transgenic lines was able to significantly promote or delay the floral transition (S9 Fig).. We have also attempted to study the effect of lost miP1a/b activity using available T-DNA insertion lines and transgenic plants overexpressing artificial microRNAs. Owing to the small size of genes encoding microProteins, T-DNA insertions in microProtein genes are more infrequent compared to larger genes. We have characterized the only available T-DNA insertion line in the miP1a gene (GABI-KAT line 288G08). This line however did not show a reduction or loss of miP1a mRNA levels but had slightly increased levels of miP1a expression; flowering time was comparable to wild type plants (S10A and S10B Fig). Transgenic plants overexpressing artificial microRNAs targeting both miP1a and miP1b also neither showed a mutant phenotype nor were miP1a/b mRNA levels substantially decreased (S10C Fig).. To study the flowering behavior of plants with reduced miP1a/b mRNA levels we used the microRNA-induced gene silencing (MIGS) technology [28] and overexpressed the sequences encoding the miP1a/b-specific carboxy terminal regions (for MIGS-miP1a and MIGS-miP1b) or the full-length coding sequences of both miP1a and miP1b fused to a miR173-binding site (for MIGS-miP1ab). These fusion constructs are recognized by miR173, which elicits the production of trans-acting siRNAs (tasi-RNAs) that target then either miP1a or miP1b alone or miP1a and miP1b mRNA simultaneously. In total we were able to recover two transgenic plants overexpressing a miP1a-MIGS construct and ten transgenic plants overexpressing a miP1b-MIGS construct. Both miP1a-MIGS transgenic plants exhibited wild type flowering behavior whereas six out of ten miP1b-MIGS were slightly early flowering. Because this flowering time phenotype was weak, we performed a double-blind flowering time study of progeny plants of one representative line in long day conditions. In this experiment miP1b-MIGS transgenic plants flowered slightly but significantly earlier compared to Col-0 wild type plants (Fig 2D and 2E). In addition, we also found miP1b mRNA levels to be significantly reduced and FT mRNA to be slightly increased in expression (Fig 2F). It is interesting to note that miP1a expression is not significantly affected by overexpression of the MIGS-miP1b construct, suggesting that there is little cross-reactivity of the tasiRNAs. In addition to MIGS-miP1b transgenic plants, we also generated transgenic MIGS-miP1a/b plants by overexpressing their respective coding sequences fused to the miR173 target sequence. MIGS-miP1a/b transgenic plants also exhibited an early flowering phenotype under long day conditions; had strongly reduced levels of both miP1a and miP1b and slightly increased levels of FT mRNA. These findings suggest that miP1b, and maybe to a lesser extend miP1a, play a role in the CO-mediated long-day flowering-promotion pathway.. Besides flowering time control B-Box proteins have been described to control other developmental and adaptive growth processes. For example when overexpressed, STO can e.g. promote root growth in high salt conditions [29]. Using the same growth conditions, we tested whether besides flowering time control miP1a/b might have additional roles when ectopically expressed. In response to high salt concentrations neither miP1a nor miP1b had a significant effect on root elongation growth when overexpressed (S11 Fig) supporting the idea that the major role of miP1a/b seems to be flowering time control.. . . The diurnal pattern of miP1a/b mRNA expression partially coincides with CO mRNA expression peaks. The abundance of CO mRNA is regulated by GIGANTEA and exhibits a diurnal expression pattern with a peak of expression occurring 16 hours after dawn both in long and short day conditions [10]. Following the peak of CO mRNA, FT mRNA expression also increases, which is causal for the early flowering phenotypes of Col-0 wild type plants in long day conditions (Fig 3A). Under short day conditions only CO mRNA shows a cyclic expression pattern, while FT mRNA is not induced (Fig 3B). When miP1a is ectopically expressed at high levels, CO mRNA abundance remains largely unchanged while the expression levels of FT mRNA lack the typical peak in expression at the end of the long day (Fig 3C and 3D). High ectopic expression of miP1b also caused changes to the circadian expression profile of CO mRNA and the peak towards the end of the light period was absent (Fig 3E and 3F). However, ectopic expression of either miP1a or miP1b resulted in non-cyclic FT expression in response to long day conditions, which supports the late flowering phenotype of the respective transgenic plants.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005959.g003. Fig 3. . Diurnal expression profiles of CO, FT, miP1a and miP1b.. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of CO and FT (A-F), miP1a (G,H) and miP1b (I,J). Plants were grown in 16-hour long days (A, C, E, G, H) or 8-hour short day conditions (B, D, F, H, J). Samples were harvested every 3 h over a time period of 24 h. Expression levels are relative to GAPDH and the error bars represent the standard deviation of four technical replicates. (A,B) CO and FT expression in Col-0 wild type plants. (C,D) CO and FT expression in transgenic 35S::FLAG-miP1a plants. (E,F) CO and FT expression in transgenic 35S::FLAG-miP1b plants. (G,H) Expression profile of miP1a in LD and SD. (I,J) Expression profile of miP1b in LD and SD.. . . . To test whether miP1a/b exhibit diurnal mRNA expression profiles similar to that of CO, we tested their expression by qRT-PCR. We detected diurnal patterns of expression for the mRNAs of both microProtein genes with a maximum expression towards the end of the 24-hour period (Fig 3G-3K). The miP1a mRNA also showed a second peak of expression in the early time points of long days (Fig 3G). It is also interesting to note that miP1a mRNA levels are higher in short days compared to long days. The expression pattern of miP1b is highly reminiscent of the CO diurnal mRNA profile under both short and long days (Fig 3I and 3K).. Taken together, we demonstrated that both microProtein genes show diurnal mRNA expression profiles with expression maxima coinciding with elevated levels of CO mRNA. When miP1a/b are overexpressed CO mRNA remains largely unchanged while FT mRNA is no longer up-regulated towards the end of the long day photoperiod. This finding supports the idea that CO protein activity is affected when miP1a/b are ectopically high.. . . Overexpression of miP1a in transgenic plants ectopically expressing CO alters flowering time. To assess whether miP1a/b have the potential to inhibit CO activity in transgenic plants overexpressing CO in the vasculature, we crossed very early flowering SUC2::CO plants with late flowering 35S::miP1a plants. Progeny plants carrying both transgenes show an intermediate flowering behavior when compared to wild type and SUC2::CO plants (Fig 4A and 4B). This delay in flowering is not due to an effect on the levels of CO expression (Fig 4C). However, FT levels are significantly lower in SUC2::CO 35S::miP1a plants compared to SUC2::CO plants explaining the intermediate flowering phenotype (Fig 4D). When compared to wild type plants, the levels of FT expression in SUC2::CO 35S::miP1a plants are still strongly induced (around 50-fold). This can be explained by the fact that the SUC2 promoter is much stronger in the phloem companion cells than the 35S promoter and thus CO is more abundant causing SUC2::CO 35S::miP1a plants to flower earlier than the wild type.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005959.g004. Fig 4. . Genetic interaction studies reveal that miP1a/b control CO protein activity, have the same spatial expression pattern and are feedback-regulated via the photoperiodic flowering time pathway..

(c, d) Quantification of transcript levels of (C) CO and (D) FT by qRT-PCR shows that CO expression levels are up-regulated in both SUC2::CO and SUC2::CO 35S-miP1a plants but FT levels are higher in SUC2::CO compared to SUC2::CO 35S-miP1a. (E) Spatial expression pattern of CO, FT and miP1a and miP1b reveals that all genes are expressed in vascular tissue of vegetative rosette leaves.

Venn diagrams showing overlap between up- and down-regulated genes; p-values are based on the hypergeometric distribution function (phyper using R 3.2.2).. . . . . . The microProteins miP1a/b are expressed in the vasculature of leaves. Analysis of the spatial expression patterns of both CO and FT revealed that they are expressed in the vasculature of leaves [30]. Expression of both genes in vascular cells is also sufficient to trigger the transition to flowering [13]. We attempted to investigate the spatial expression patterns of miP1-type microProteins. Expression analysis of miP1a and miP1b in transgenic plants expressing a genomic fragment of either miP1a or miP1b fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS), revealed that both microProteins have a broader and more patchy pattern of expression compared to CO but are also predominantly expressed in vascular tissue (Fig 4E) of leaves, the tissue where CO is acting to regulate photoperiod-dependent flowering.. In addition to the expression in leaves we also detected GUS expression for both miP1a/b in petioles of leaves where CO does not seem to be expressed. It is interesting to note that both microProtein genes are highly abundant in the shoot apical meristem, where CO also seems to be expressed.. The finding that miP1a/b are co-expressed in vascular tissue and have the ability to interact with CO, supports a regulatory role. Furthermore, when ectopically expressed in the phloem companion cells, SUC2::miP1a can also strongly delay the floral transition indicating that miP1a is functional in the phloem and that CO is likely the major target of miP1a (S12 Fig).. . . Identification of transcripts affected by CO inactivation. To further corroborate the idea that the predominant function of miP1a/b is to regulate CO protein activity, we characterized transcriptomes of Col-0 wild type, co mutants (co-SAIL) and the transgenic plants overexpressing miP1a and miP1b using RNA-Seq (see S1 Data). The downregulated-transcriptomes of 35S::FLAG-miP1a and 35S::FLAG-miP1b have a 60% overlap which is quite substantial but not surprising. Interestingly, around 80% of the genes down-regulated in the co mutant background (relative to Col-0) are also down-regulated in the transgenic 35S::FLAG-miP1b plants (Fig 4F) supporting the idea that CO protein activity is strongly compromised by miP1b-overexpression. To validate the observation that differentially expressed genes identified by mRNA-Seq are truly altered in expression, we performed individual qRT-PCRs to test expression of five candidate genes (S13 Fig). These RT-PCRs largely confirm the RNA-Seq results. We find genes down-regulated in all three genotypes (e.g. FUL and At3g49340) but also genes whose expression is unchanged in 35S::FLAG-miP1a but down-regulated in co mutants and 35S::FLAG-miP1b (e.g. ZAT7) indicating that miP1a and miP1b might also have diverging functions. The same is true for genes up-regulated in the investigated genotypes (S13 Fig). In all three genotypes (co, 35S::FLAG-miP1a, 35S::FLAG-miP1b), the expression levels of FT are among the top down-regulated genes confirming that the late flowering phenotype of 35S::FLAG-miP1a and 35S::FLAG-miP1b, like in co mutants, is due to the failure of inducing FT expression. Another flowering time gene found to be down-regulated in all three genotypes is FRUITFUL (FUL) which acts downstream of FT [31], further supporting the hypothesis that miP1a/b act by inhibiting CO activity. These findings are in agreement with unchanged CO mRNA levels in miP1a/b over-expression plants, which indicates that the inhibition of CO likely occurs at the post-translational level. We also analyzed genes up-regulated in co, 35S::FLAG-miP1a, 35S::FLAG-miP1b and found MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING5 (MAF5) to be up-regulated in all three genotypes relative to Col-0 (Fig 4F). MAF5 acts as a floral repressor that is strongly controlled epigenetically [32,33], which is in line with the late flowering phenotype observed in co loss-of-function and miP1a/b gain-of-function plants. Whether and how elevated MAF5 mRNA levels contribute to the late flowering phenotype of co mutant plants is currently unknown.. . . Phylogenetic analysis of miP1a/b-type microProteins in different plant genomes. To gain more information on how miP1a/b-type proteins have evolved, we used Phytozome [34] and extracted all miP1a/b-type related proteins from different species. The multiple sequence alignment of all species revealed that the first B-Box and the remnants of the second B-Box are highly conserved. Surprisingly, there is a very high conservation for the last five amino acids, constituting the PF(V/L)FL motif (Fig 5A and S14 Fig). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that miP1a/b-type proteins evolved in the Pentapetalae family of dicotyledonous plants. Using the last five amino acids as anchor, we find that the carboxy terminal motif of the most ancient miP1a/b-type proteins in the Fabidae family varies significantly (S15 and S16 Figs). In Glycine max for example, we find one protein with the sequence LSLLL that strongly resembles the LxLxL motif, which has been shown to mediate interactions with TOPLESS-related co-repressor proteins. It is interesting to note that the PFVFL motif that is found exclusively in the Brassicaceae family evolved by acquiring a single point mutation that changed the leucine in the middle position to a valine. Because of the high degree of conservation of the PF(V/L)FL motif, we can assume that it confers a biological activity to miP1a/b-type proteins. The finding that the ancestral motif strongly resembles a TOPLESS-interaction motif suggested to us that these small proteins might function by engaging with TOPLESS/TOPLESS-related co-repressor proteins.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005959.g005. Fig 5. . The microProteins miP1a/b interact with the TOPLESS co-repressor protein to repress flowering..

(C) Yeast-two-hybrid interaction of miP1a with the TOPLESS co-repressor. Growth of serial dilutions on non-selective SD-medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (-L/-W) show normal yeast growth. Only positive interactors were able to grow on restrictive growth medium supplemented with 10mM 3-Aminotriazole (3-AT) and lacking histidine. (D) Western blot analysis of transgenic plants.. . . . . . MiP1a/b act by recruiting TOPLESS co-repressor proteins. The analysis of publicly available protein interactome data [35] further indicated that miP1a could potentially interact with TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED co-repressor proteins. To test if miP1a/b type microProteins interact with TOPLESS (TPL), we performed direct yeast-two-hybrid interaction test. In this assay both miP1a and miP1*, the latter having mutations in the B-Box domain, interacted with the TPL protein (Fig 5C). CO protein did not interact with TPL in this assay and neither did miP1adeltaPFVFL, a miP1a variant lacking the last five amino acids (Fig 5C). To further explore the possibility that the PF(V/L)FL motif has an in vivo function, we compared transgenic plants overexpressing either full-length miP1a/b proteins with transgenic plants overexpressing protein variants lacking the last five amino acids (35S::FLAG:miPa/bdeltaPFVFL). Under inductive long day conditions, both miP1a/b overexpressors exhibit a late flowering phenotype whereas transgenic plants overexpressing either miP1adeltaPFVFL or miP1bdeltaPFVFL exhibit an intermediate flowering behavior (Fig 5B). To exclude the possibility that these transgenic plants accumulate diverging amounts of miP1a/b proteins we determined protein expression levels by western blot analysis. We find that the levels of transgenic proteins are largely similar (Fig 5D) excluding the possibility that removal of the PF(V/L)FL motif affects transcript or protein stability.. When GFP-CO and RFP-TPL are transiently co-expressed with either miP1a, miP1a* (B-Box dead mutant that does not interact with CO) or miP1adeltaPFVFL (miP1a version lacking TPL-interaction motif) different sub-nuclear localizations pattern can be observed (Fig 6A). RFP-TPL shows a high degree of co-localization with GFP-CO, when the wild type miP1a version is co-expressed. Co-expression of the miP1a* mutant version results in an even distribution of RFP-TPL throughout the nucleus while CO-GFP localizes in small sub-nuclear speckles. We observe large sub-nuclear speckles for GFP-CO when either miP1a or the miP1adeltaPFVFL variant is co-expressed. However, in the case of miP1adeltaPFVFL, we see exclusion of RFP-TPL from the CO speckles implying that miP1a/b-type microProteins engage CO and TPL in a tripartite complex.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005959.g006. Fig 6. . The microProteins miP1a/b act by engaging CO in a TOPLESS/TOPLESS-like co-repressor complex.. (A) Representative image series of co-localization studies of GFP-CO and RFP-TPL co transformed with either miP1a (n = 15), the B-Box-dead version miP1a* (n = 16) or miP1adeltaPFVFL (n = 9) that is lacking the TPL-interaction motif. (B) Yeast-three-hybrid demonstrating the formation of a CO-TPL-miP1a trimeric complex.

Only positive interactions were able to grow on restrictive growth medium supplemented with 10mM 3-Aminotriazole (3-AT) and lacking histidine. (C) In vitro pull-down experiments. Recombinant MBP-CO, GST-miP1a, GST-miP1adeltaPFVFL, GST-ZPR3 and HIS-TPL proteins were produced in E. coli. After cell lysis, cell extracts of MBP-CO and HIS-TPL were mixed with GST-miP1a, GST-miP1adeltaPFVFL or GST-ZPR3 and incubated with magnetic anti-GST coupled magnetic beads (Promega). GST-miP1a, GST-miP1adeltaPFVFL and GST-ZPR3 complexes were precipitated and washed using a magnetic stand, eluted by boiling in SDS-loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. HIS-TPL and MBP-CO Proteins were detected by immunoblotting. (D) In vitro pull-down experiment of the trimeric TPL-miP1a-CO complex. MBP-CO and HIS-TPL were mixed with either miP1a or miP1a* proteins. After immunoprecipitation of MBP-CO with an amylose resin proteins were detected by immunoblotting.. . . . Because miP1a/b-type microProteins do not harbor a DNA-binding motif it seems likely that they act as adaptors to recruit TPL/TPR co-repressor proteins to transcription factors and bridge between the transcription factor and the co-repressor complex. To investigate this hypothesis we performed a yeast-three-hybrid study and tested whether miP1a is able to bridge between CO and TPL, which showed no interaction in the yeast-two-hybrid system (Fig 6B). When co-transformed with the empty pDR plasmid, AD-CO and BD-TPL were still unable to induce yeast growth on selective medium. However, in the presence of the miP1a protein, yeast growth was strongly induced, supporting the idea that miP1a is able to bridge between CO and TPL. These findings support the idea that miP1a/b-type proteins act as TPL/TPR-bridging factors for B-Box transcription factors and engage these transcription factors in transcriptional repressor complexes. The existence of a CO-miP1a-TPL trimeric complex is further supported by in vitro pull down assays, where MBP-CO and 6xHis-TPL can be co-precipitated with GST-miP1a (Fig 6C). GST-miP1adeltaPFVFL is able to bind MBP-CO but fails to bind the 6xHis-TPL protein. GST-ZPR3 was used as negative control and can neither bind MBP-CO nor 6xHis-TPL. Experiments with MBP-CO as bait for HIS-TPL confirm this observation, as TPL only co-precipitates when wild type miP1a protein is present. The presence of miP1a* which cannot interact with CO is unable to facilitate an interaction between CO and TPL. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that miP1a/b-type microProteins can mediate between CO and the transcriptional repressor TPL..
PMC4199496	Results. . ACC/Ethylene Pretreatment or Activated Ethylene Signaling Increases Salt Tolerance. Previous studies investigating the effect of ethylene in salt stress were conducted in conditions where ethylene and salt stress were simultaneously applied [23]. Because several salt-induced seedlings responses, such as leaf epinasty, chlorophyll loss and growth retardation, are also regulated by ethylene [4], [5], it is sometimes not clear how the final morphological output is the result of an altered salt or ethylene response. To specifically ascertain the role of ethylene in salt response, we pretreated Arabidopsis seedlings with ethylene or its biosynthesis precursor ACC and then transferred to MS medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl alone. Upon ACC pretreatment, wild-type Col-0 displayed enhanced tolerance to salt compared with untreated control, with higher survival rate and lower relative electrolyte leakage (an indicator for the salt stress damage) [26] (Figure 1A-C). By comparison, ebf1-1 mutant showed slightly lower survival rate, whereas ebf2-1, an ethylene hypersensitive mutant [16], was more tolerant to salt than Col-0 upon ACC pretreatment (Figure 1A-C). Consistent with their respective ethylene response phenotype, ctr1-1, EIN3ox (a transgenic plant overexpressing EIN3) as well as EIL1ox displayed constitutively enhanced salt tolerance, whereas ACC pretreatment had virtually no effect on the salt tolerance of ethylene insensitive mutants, etr1-1, ein2-5 and ein3-1eil1-1 (Figure 1A-C; Figure S1). To further examine the effect of ACC pretreatment on salt tolerance, 5-day-old seedlings of wild-type, ein3-1eil1-1 and EIN3ox were also transferred onto MS medium supplemented with serial concentrations of NaCl (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mM). Similarly, ACC pretreatment significantly increased the survival rate, fresh weight as well as root length of wild-type but not ein3-1eil1-1 compared with ACC-untreated plants when 100 mM or higher concentrations of NaCl were applied (Figure S2E. vs. S2B, S2F. vs. S2C and S2G. vs. S2D). Consistently, EIN3ox seedlings showed constitutively increased salt tolerance in terms of survival rate, fresh weight and root length (Figure S2E. vs. S2B, S2F. vs. S2C and S2G. vs. S2D). Together, these results demonstrate that ACC pretreatment or overexpression of EIN3 leads to increased tolerance to salt stress, which depends on the canonical ethylene signaling pathway.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004664.g001. Figure 1. . ACC/Ethylene pretreatment or enhanced ethylene signaling increases salt tolerance.. (A) Plants were grown on MS medium with or without 10 M ACC for 5 d and then transferred onto MS medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl for 3 d. Plants were also transferred onto MS medium as controls. (B) Survival rate of plants shown in (A). Seedling death was scored as complete bleaching of cotyledons and leaves. Values are mean  SD from 25 seedlings per replicate (n=3 replicates).

(E) Survival rate of plants pretreated with air or 20 ppm ethylene for indicated time and then transferred onto medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl. Survival rates were calculated on the third day after transfer. Values are mean  SD from 20 seedlings per replicate (n=4 replicates). A5E0: 5 d of air treatment. A2E1A2: 2 d of air followed by 1 d of ethylene then 2 d of air treatment. A1E2A2: 1 d of air followed by 2 d of ethylene then 2 d of air treatment. A0E5: 5 d of ethylene treatment. ET: ethylene. (Student's t test, *P<0.05 and **P<0.01).. . . . To exclude the possibility that the observed effect of ACC pretreatment was due to the residual ACC remained in the pretreated seedlings, the experiment was repeated using ethylene gas, which was quickly diffusing away. After 5 days of 10 ppm ethylene gas treatment, seedlings were transferred onto MS medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl in the air, and survival rates were calculated after two, three and four days, respectively. We found that ethylene pretreatment effectively increased the tolerance to salt in wild-type, ebf2-1 and ctr1-1, evidenced by higher survival rates after three or four days of salt treatment, but had little effect on ein2-5 and ein3-1eil1-1 (Figure 1D). Ethylene pretreatments with different lengths of time were also investigated. Seedlings pretreated with ethylene for 2 or 5 days exhibited increasingly enhanced survival rate in Col-0, ebf2-1, but not in ein2-5 and ein3-1eil1-1, while 1 day of ethylene pretreatment had only marginal effect (Figure 1E). Together with the ACC pretreatment experiments, these results support that exogenous ethylene application beforehand effectively increases salt tolerance.. To further study the function of EIN3/EIL1 in ethylene-mediated salt response, a transgenic line expressing estradiol-inducible EIN3-FLAG in the ein3 eil1 ebf1 ebf2 quadruple mutant (iE/qm) was investigated [18]. Previous studies demonstrated that the iE/qm seedlings were completely insensitive to exogenously applied ethylene, and the accumulation of EIN3-FLAG fusion protein can be induced by estradiol (but not by ethylene) in a dose-dependent manner [18]. As reported, the EIN3-FLAG protein was undetected in estradiol-untreated iE/qm, and it was evidently induced in iE/qm upon estradiol treatment, but ACC treatment did not further increase its protein accumulation (Figure S3A, Lane 1, 2, 8, or Lane 7, 9). We also found that salt treatment did not affect EIN3 protein level in estradiol-treated iE/qm regardless of treatment time (Figure S3A, Lane 3-5, or Lane 2, 6). These results demonstrated that the estradiol-induced EIN3 protein accumulation in iE/qm seedlings is not altered by ethylene or salt treatment.. Next, we investigated whether the estradiol-induced EIN3 protein in iE/qm seedlings effectively increased the tolerance to salt stress. In the absence of estadiol, where EIN3 protein was not detectable, the cotyledons and leaves of iE/qm seedlings treated with 200 mM NaCl were severely bleached after 3 days (Figure S3B), and the survival rate was declined to less than 30% (Figure S3C). In contrast, in the presence of serial concentrations of estradiol (from 0.1 to 20 M), iE/qm seedlings treated with 200 mM NaCl for 3 days appeared largely green and healthy (Figure S3B), and the survival rates remained over 90% in all cases (Figure S3C). Despite all concentrations of estradiol were sufficient for conferring salt tolerance, we noted that iE/qm seedlings supplemented with lower concentrations (0.1 or 1 M) grew better on salt medium (Figure S3B). Therefore, all subsequent physiological experiments were performed with 1 M estradiol. In line with cotyledon yellowing phenotype and survival rate, the leaf chlorophyll content and fresh shoot weight were significantly higher in estradiol-treated iE/qm seedlings than the untreated control under salt stress condition (Figure S3D, S3F). Conversely, upon salt treatment, the ion leakage was evidently lower in estradiol-treated iE/qm plants than the untreated control (Figure S3E). Taken together, these results indicate that loss of EIN3/EIL1 function leads to hypersensitivity to salt stress whereas accumulation of EIN3 alone results in enhanced salt tolerance, highlighting the requirement and sufficiency of EIN3/EIL1 for salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.. . . High Salinity Enhances EIN3 Protein Accumulation and Transcriptional Activity in Both EIN2-Dependent and EIN2-Independent Manners. Given that EIN3 is a critical regulator of plant salt responses, we next determined whether, and if so, how EIN3 is modulated by salt stress. We first monitored the level of endogenous EIN3 protein using an anti-EIN3 antibody [16], [18] in response to salt treatment. We found that the levels of EIN3 protein started to increase after 3 h of salt treatment and dramatically accumulated after 6 h of treatment in wild-type Col-0 (Figure 2A). We also checked the levels of EIN3 mRNA and found no obvious change after 6 h of salt treatment (Figure S4), suggesting that salt regulates EIN3 accumulation at the protein level.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004664.g002. Figure 2. . Salt treatment promotes protein accumulation and transcriptional activity of EIN3 in both EIN2-dependent and EIN2-independent manners.. (A) Salt treatment promotes EIN3 protein accumulation in wild type. 5-d-old seedlings were treated with 200 mM NaCl for 3 h and 6 h. Protein was extracted and subjected to immunoblots using anti-EIN3 antibody. A nonspecific band was used as a loading control. (B) Salt treatment promotes EIN3 protein accumulation in ein2-5 mutant. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results. (C) Histochemical analysis of 5xEBS:GUS transgenic plants. (D) 5xEBS:GUS activity in Col-0 or ein2-5 background was measured. Two biological replicates and three technical replicates were performed (Student's t test, *P<0.05 and **P<0.01). (E-G) Real-time RT-PCR analysis of gene expression of ERF1 (E), ERF2 (F) and PDF1.2 (G).. . . . Previous study indicated that EIN2 is absolutely required for ethylene-induced EIN3/EIL1 accumulation, as no EIN3 or EIL1 protein can be detected in ein2 mutant [16], [18]. To determine whether EIN2 is required for salt-induced EIN3/EIL1 protein accumulation, we detected the EIN3/EIL1 protein level in ein2-5 mutant under salt treatment. Surprisingly, we found that salt treatment (but not mock treatment, Figure S5A) promoted EIN3 and EIL1 proteins accumulation in the ein2-5 mutant background, although not as dramatic as in wild-type (Figure 2B and Figure S6). These results indicate that the salt stress signal is able to promote EIN3/EIL1 proteins accumulation in an EIN2-independent manner. In addition, we also analyzed the EIN3 protein levels in an ethylene receptor mutant etr1-1. [9] upon treatment with 200 mM NaCl for 3 h and 6 h using anti-EIN3 antibody. We found that EIN3 protein was evidently induced in etr1-1 mutants upon salt treatment for 6 h (Figure S5B), suggesting that salt induced EIN3 protein accumulation does not require the canonical ethylene perception.. We next investigated whether salt-induced EIN3 protein is transcriptionally functioning. A transgenic reporter line that harbors the GUS report gene driven by five tandem repeats of the EIN3 binding site (EBS) followed by the minimal 35S promoter, 5xEBS:GUS, has been previously used to monitor the transcriptional activity of EIN3 [27], [28]. Upon salt treatment, GUS staining became overly intensified in the cotyledons and hypocotyls of 5xEBS:GUS/Col-0 plants (Figure 2C), indicative of elevated levels of EIN3 activity under this condition, which was further supported by a quantification assay (Figure 2D). Compared to that in Col-0 background, GUS activity was also evidently up-regulated in 5xEBS:GUS/ein2-5 plants upon salt treatment, although to a lesser extent (Figure 2C and 2D). By contrast, GUS activity in 5xEBS:GUS/ein3 eil1 plants did not increase upon salt stress (Figure 2D), suggesting that salt-increased 5xEBS:GUS activity is EIN3/EIL1-dependent. We also observed that the expression levels of several ethylene responsive genes, including ERF1, ERF2 and PDF1.2, were up-regulated by salt in both wild type and ein2-5 mutants (Figure 2E-G). In keeping with the results of EIN3 accumulation and GUS expression (Figure 2B-D), the expression level of ERF1, a direct target gene of EIN3 [17], was also lower in salt-treated ein2-5 mutant compared with that in wild-type (Figure 2E). Thus, although salt treatment did promote EIN3 protein accumulation in ein2-5, the relative lower level and activity of EIN3 might be inadequate to compensate for the loss of EIN2 that could elicit additional pathways contributing to salt tolerance. Taken together, our results suggest that, in addition to the canonical EIN2-dependent pathway, there exists a new pathway independent of EIN2 to mediate the salt stress signal to promote EIN3/EIL1 protein accumulation.. . . Salt Promotes EBF1/EBF2 Protein Degradation in an EIN2-Independent Manner. It has been established that the stability of EIN3 is controlled by two F-box proteins, EBF1/EBF2, and that ethylene-induced EIN3 stabilization is at least partly mediated by the destabilization of EBF1/EBF2 proteins in an EIN2-dependent manner [16], [18], [19], [20]. To further characterize how EIN3 accumulation is enhanced by salt, we examined the levels of EBF1/EBF2 protein after salt treatment. Our initial effort to produce polyclonal antibodies recognizing endogenous EBF1 or EBF2 protein in plant tissues was unsuccessful. Therefore, two transgenic lines, 35S:EBF1-MYC/Col-0 and 35S:EBF2-MYC/Col-0 [18], were used to detect the EBF1 and EBF2 protein levels. Immunoblot analysis showed that the protein levels of EBF1-MYC and EBF2-MYC markedly decreased upon salt treatment (Figure 3A). We also noted that ACC pretreatment seemed to reinforce the destruction of EBF1/EBF2 proteins, as seedlings pretreated with ACC accumulated less EBF1/EBF2 proteins after salt application (Figure 3A). Together with the finding that EIN3 protein level is not altered by salt in iE/qm seedlings (Figure S3A), these results suggest that the salt-induced accumulation of EIN3 protein is due to reduced levels of EIN3-targeting F-box proteins.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004664.g003. Figure 3. . Salt treatment promotes EBF1/EBF2 protein degradation in an EIN2-independent manner.. (A) Immunoblot assays of EBF1/2-MYC protein in Col-0. Transgenic seedlings overexpressing EBF1/2-MYC in Col-0 grown on MS medium supplemented with or without 10 M ACC for 5 d were subjected to 200 mM NaCl for 3 h and 6 h. A nonspecific band was used as a loading control. (B) Immunoblot assay of EBF2-GFP protein in ein2-5 background. Transgenic seedlings overexpressing EBF2-GFP in ein2-5 background grown on medium supplemented with or without 10 M ACC for 5 d were subjected to 200 mM NaCl for 3 h and 6 h. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results. (C) Salt induced EBF2 protein degradation was inhibited by MG132. 5-d-old plants were treated with 200 mM NaCl or/and 50 M MG132 for 6 h. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results. (D) GFP fluorescence of 35S:EBF2-GFP in the roots of ein2-5 mutant. The seedlings grown on MS medium for 5 d were treated with 200 mM NaCl and/or 50 M MG132 for 6 h.. . . . Our above data showed that salt induced EIN3 protein accumulation in ein2-5 mutant, so we asked whether salt-induced destruction of EBF1/EBF2 proteins also take place in the absence of EIN2 function. To address this question, a previously generated transgenic line, 35S:EBF2-GFP/ein2-5, which showed high level of EBF2-GFP accumulation [18], was used. Immunoblot analysis showed that the protein levels of EBF2-GFP markedly decreased upon salt treatment, regardless of ACC pretreatment (Figure 3B). By contrast, treatment with MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, promoted a dramatic accumulation of EBF2-GFP and reversed the salt-induced EBF2-GFP degradation (Figure 3C). Similarly, GFP fluorescence was dramatically reduced in the 35S:EBF2-GFP/ein2-5 after salt treatment, but MG132 treatment effectively reversed the salt effect and stabilized EBF2-GFP protein (Figure 3D). We further examined the effect of other salt ions on EBF2 stability, and found that, as NaCl, treatments of KCl, NaNO3 and KNO3 all similarly led to the destruction of EBF2-GFP protein in ein2-5 mutant background (Figure S7A). We also excluded the involvement of osmotic stress in the control of salt-induced EBF protein degradation, as high dose of mannitol treatment (200 mM) had no effect on EBF2-GFP stability (Figure S7B). Collectively, our data clearly demonstrated that salt stress leads to the proteasome-mediated degradation of EBF1/EBF2 proteins independent of the upstream ethylene signaling components, such as EIN2.. . . Transcriptome Profiling Analyses Identify Salt-Regulated EIN3/EIL1-Dependent Genes. Our above data indicated that EIN3/EIL1 are both necessary and sufficient for conferring enhanced salt tolerance. To elucidate the molecular network underlying EIN3/EIL1-induced salt tolerance, we performed transcriptome profiling of EIN3ox, ein3eil1 and wild type Col-0. For this analysis, 5-day-old light-grown seedlings treated with or without 200 mM NaCl for 6 h were used. This design enabled us to compare the transcriptional profiles among plants with different levels of EIN3 activity, as well as to identify salt-regulated and EIN3/EIL1-dependent genes.. Treatment with high salt for 6 h resulted in the induction of 1482 transcripts while the repression of 1745 transcripts (using both q value<0.05 and 2-fold as a cutoff) in wild-type Col-0 (Figure 4E, 4F). Applying a q value<0.05 and 5-fold as a cutoff, 509 transcripts were induced while 209 transcripts were repressed in wild type by salt treatment, which were arbitrarily defined as salt-regulated genes in this study (Figure 4A and 4B). Using the same cutoff, 365 and 74 transcripts in EIN3ox while 281 and 98 transcripts in ein3eil1 were induced and repressed by salt treatment, respectively (Figure 4A, 4B). Of the 509 salt-induced genes, 162 were also elevated in salt-treated EIN3ox and ein3eil1 mutant (Figure 4A). Conversely, 36 out of 209 salt-repressed genes were also down-regulated in salt-treated EIN3ox and ein3eil1 mutant (Figure 4B). To investigate how EIN3 activation leads to increased salt tolerance, we were particularly interested in two classes of genes: salt-induced EIN3/EIL1-dependent (SIED) genes and salt-repressed EIN3/EIL1-dependent (SRED) genes (Figure 4C, 4D). The former class includes those genes whose levels are induced by salt at least 5-fold in Col-0 (P value 0.0041), plus that salt induction is more pronounced in EIN3ox (P value 0.00099) but less in ein3 eil1 (P value 0.0094) (i.e. salt-induced gene expression is at least partly dependent on EIN3 activity) (Table S1). The latter class includes those genes whose levels are repressed by salt at least 5-fold in Col-0 (P value 0.0016), plus that salt repression is more pronounced in EIN3ox (P value 0.00093) but less in ein3 eil1 (P value 0.0081) (Table S2).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004664.g004. Figure 4. . Transcriptome profiling analyses identify salt-regulated EIN3/EIL1-dependent genes.. (A) and (B) Venn diagrams showing the overlaps among transcripts induced or repressed (q<0.05 and 5-fold change as a cutoff) by salt in Col-0, ein3eil1 and EIN3ox plants. (C) and (D) Hierarchical clusters displaying the salt-induced expression of those SIED (Salt-Induced EIN3/EIL1-Dependent) and SRED (Salt-Repressed EIN3/EIL1-Dependent) genes in Col-0, ein3eil1 and EIN3ox plants. A total of 114 SIED genes (C) and 14 SRED genes (D) were included in the cluster (Table S1 and S2). (E) and (F) Venn diagrams showing the overlaps between transcripts induced or repressed (2-fold cutoff) by salt in Col-0 and transcripts induced or repressed (2-fold cutoff) by overexpression of EIN3 (comparing transcriptome of EIN3ox versus Col-0 under unstressed condition).. . . . Based on these criteria, 114 SIED genes and 14 SRED genes were identified (Table S1 and S2). The drastic difference on the number of SIED and SRED genes suggested that EIN3/EIL1 might enhance salt tolerance mainly through inducing genes or pathways that participate in plant survival, rather than repressing genes or pathways that lead to plant death under salinity stress. In support of this speculation, 18 out of 114 SIED genes (16%) are defense-related genes that function to enhance plant tolerance or resistance to abiotic or biotic stresses. Several ERF (11) and JAZ (3) genes were found to be SIED genes, implying that the signaling pathways of ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA), two stress hormones, have been preferentially activated by salt stress, which is consistent with previous studies [23], [29], [30]. The considerable enrichment of ERF genes, many of which are direct target genes of EIN3 [17], [31], suggests that the identification of SIED genes is biologically relevant. Furthermore, when compared the SIEDs with ethylene-regulated EIN3-target genes identified by ChIP-Sequencing [32], we found that 15 out of 114 SIEDs (Highlighted in Table S1), such as At5g22270 and At5g59820 (ZAT12), are the direct targets of EIN3. However, most of SIEDs are not the target genes of EIN3 identified by Chang et al. [32]. This could be due to that EIN3 preferentially binds to specific subsets of target promoters dependent on the initial treatment/stimulus. Alternatively, it is also possible that the majority of SIED genes are indirectly induced by EIN3, for instance, via the ERF transcription factors. The SIED genes were further analyzed using the gene ontology (GO) enrichment tool Gorilla [33]. We found that, in terms of molecular function category, there were notable enrichments for metabolic processes, as well as transcription, DNA binding, and oxidoreductase activity (Figure S8). For instance, of 114 SIED genes, we found 9 genes encoding oxidoreductases and 4 genes involved in electron transport or energy pathways, suggesting that modulation of oxidative/reductive status under salt stress might be an important mechanism of EIN3/EIL1 action to enhance plant survival.. In this study, we demonstrated that pretreatment with ethylene conferred increased salt tolerance, which depends on the action of EIN3/EIL1 (Figure 1). One explanation for this priming effect of ethylene is that EIN3/EIL1 activation in advance alters the expression of genes that ultimately leads to salt tolerance. To test this possibility, we compared the salt-regulated transcriptome (salt-treated versus untreated Col-0) and EIN3-regulated transcriptome (EIN3ox versus Col-0 without salt treatment). By a 2-fold cutoff, 366 genes (P value 0.0096) were identified as EIN3-induced while 360 genes (P value 0.0099) were EIN3-repressed based on transcriptome profiling (Figure 4E, 4F). We found that 92 out of 366 EIN3-induced genes (25%) and 121 out of 360 EIN3-repressed genes (34%) were also induced and repressed by salt stress, respectively (Figure 4E, 4F). By a 5-fold cutoff, 17 out of 62 genes (27%) vastly up-regulated by EIN3 (EIN3ox versus Col-0) (P value 0.0095), were also highly induced by salt, including several ERFs, defense genes, and biosynthetic process and metabolism genes (Table S3). Six genes were selected to further verify the microarray data using qRT-PCR, which showed largely similar expression patterns (Figure S9). These results indicated that overexpression of EIN3 activated the expression of a number of stress-responsive defense and metabolism genes even under unstressed conditions. Therefore, the priming effect of ACC/ethylene pretreatment could be attributed to altered expression of numerous salt-responsive genes, which subsequently increases tolerance when salt stress is encountered. Further investigation on the functionality of these stress-responsive defense and metabolism genes in salt tolerance is needed to test this hypothesis.. . . Functional Studies of SIED Genes Identify a Novel Regulator of Salt Tolerance. To further investigate the roles of the SIED genes in salt tolerance, Salk T-DNA insertion lines of SIED genes were ordered from ABRC, and the homozygous lines of 47 insertion mutants were obtained and verified by genotyping (Table S4). Characterization of salt stress phenotype showed that, while 41 mutants were indistinguishable from wild type, 6 mutants, namely zat12, azf2, cni1, szf2, phil and SALK_067396 (hereafter designated as sied1, salt-induced and EIN3/EIL1-dependent gene 1), exhibited a salt-hypersensitivity phenotype similar to ein3 eil1, which showed low survival rate under salt stress (Figure 5A, 5B). PCR genotyping assays showed that the six mutant lines were knockout alleles in their corresponding genes (Figure S10), suggesting that these genes are positive regulators of salt tolerance.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004664.g005. Figure 5. . Functional characterization of SIED genes identifies a novel regulator of salt tolerance.. (A) Plants were grown on MS medium for 5 d and then transferred onto MS medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl for 4 d. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results. (B) Survival rate of plants shown in (A). Values are mean  SD from at least 50 seedlings per replicate (n=4 replicates). (C) qRT-PCR analysis of SIED1 expression.

(F) Overexpression of SIED1 in wild-type enhanced salt tolerance. Seedlings were grown on MS medium for 5 d and then transferred onto MS medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl for 4 d. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results. (G) Survival rate of plants shown in (F). Values are mean  SD from at least 50 seedlings per replicate (n=3 replicates). (H) and (I) Overexpression of SIED1 in ein3eil1 or sied1 backgrounds enhanced salt tolerance. Fresh weight (H) and survival rate (I) were measured (Student's t test, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001).. . . . Interestingly, five of these SIEDs, ZAT12. [34], [35], [36], AZF2. [37], SZF2. [38], CNI1. [39] and PHI1. [40] have been previously demonstrated to modulate various abiotic stresses. For instance, transgenic plants overexpressing ZAT12 were more tolerant to osmotic stress, while zat12 knockout mutants were more sensitive to osmotic and salt stress [34]. Overexpression of CNI1 (Carbon/Nitrogen Insensitive 1), a RING-type ubiquitin ligase, caused a hyposensitivity to C/N stress, and cni1 knockout mutants resulted in hypersensitivity to C/N stress and salt treatment [39]. Of the five genes, three genes encode zinc-finger transcription factors (ZAT12, AZF2, SZF2). In fact, we have identified at least 9 genes encoding zinc-finger transcriptional regulators as SIED (Table S1). It thus remains interesting to determine whether all other identified zinc-finger proteins are involved in salt tolerance. Together, our results supported the idea that many EIN3/EIL1 target genes identified in this analysis are involved in various stress responses, including salt stress.. The sixth salt-hypersensitivity mutant, sied1, corresponds to At5g22270, a functionally unknown gene encoding a 93-amino acid polypeptide. Microarray data and qRT-PCR analysis showed that SIED1 had evidently higher expression level in EIN3ox and lower level in ein3 eil1 compared with that of wild type (Figure 5C). To confirm its EIN3-induced expression pattern, we generated a transgenic reporter line that harbors the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene driven by the promoter of SIED1. Consistent with the gene expression data, GUS staining was weaker in ein3 eil1 but stronger in EIN3ox than that in wild type (Figure 5D, 5E). Moreover, we found that EIN3 directly binds to the promoter of SIED1, as well as other SIED genes including ZAT12, SZF2, PHI and AZF2, but does not bind to the promoter region of CNI1 (Figure S11E-F), indicating that EIN3 selectively binds to the promoters of many SIED genes in vivo.. Since loss-of-function SIED1 mutation led to salt hypersensitivity, we next generated transgenic plants constitutively overexpressing SIED1 in wild type to further investigate its role in salt tolerance. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that higher levels of SIED1 mRNA were detected in two independent overexpression lines 5# and 9# compared with Col-0 (Figure 5C). Phenotypic analysis showed that overexpression of SIED1 effectively enhanced salt tolerance and greatly increased survival rate upon salt treatment for 4 days (Figure 5F, 5G). Since SIED1 is a direct target of EIN3, we then determined whether overexpression of SIED1 could repress the salt-hypersensitivity phenotype of ein3eil1. Toward this end, we generated the 35S:SIED1/ein3eil1 transgenic plants. Compared with ein3eil1, the seedlings of 35S:SIED1/ein3eil1 showed significantly increased survival rate and fresh weight upon salt treatment (Figure 5H, 5I), indicating that SIED1 acts genetically downstream of EIN3 and overexpression of SIED1 is sufficient to suppress the salt-hypersensitivity phenotype of ein3eil1. As expected, overexpression of SIED1 also repressed the salt-hypersensitivity phenotype of sied1 mutant (Figure 5H, 5I). Taken together, these results identify SIED1, acting downstream of EIN3, as a novel component that plays a positive role in salt tolerance.. . . EIN3 Induces the Transcription of Peroxidases (POD) and Increases POD Activity and Diminishes ROS Accumulation. The transcriptome profiling analysis revealed that genes encoding oxidoreductase activity are enriched in SIED, suggesting that EIN3 might modulate the oxidative/reductive status under salt stress condition. Interestingly, we found that the expression of many genes encoding peroxidases (PODs) was induced in wild type by salt treatment, whose expression was also elevated in EIN3ox but reduced in ein3eil1 under salt stress (Table S1 and Figure S12). These observations were further confirmed by qRT-PCR results with six selected POD genes (Figure 6A). In the meanwhile, we did not find evident differences in the expression levels of genes encoding superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalases (CAT1, CAT2 and CAT3) and NADPH oxidases (AtRobhA-F) among the three genotypes upon salt treatment (Figure S13A-C). These results suggest that EIN3 selectively induces the expression of genes encoding peroxidases. Peroxidase activity assay also showed that POD activity was significantly higher in EIN3ox seedlings than that in wild type (P<0.05) or ein3eil1 (P<0.01) under salt stress condition (Figure 6B).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004664.g006. Figure 6. . EIN3 increases activity of peroxidases through transcriptional regulation of POD genes directly.. (A) qRT-PCR analysis of PODs expression. (B) Measurement of POD activity. The treated seedlings in (A) were also used (Student's t test, *P<0.05 and **P<0.01). (C) Schematic diagrams of putative EIN3 Binding Site (EBS) (arrows) in the promoters of two POD genes. The 1 kb upstream sequences are shown, and the translational start sites (ATG) are shown at position +1. (D) ChIP-qPCR assays of the promoter regions of POD genes from DNA of Col-0 seedlings with anti-EIN3 antibody. A Tubulin 8 fragment was amplified as control. Three biological replicates and two technical replicates were performed with similar results. (E) EMSA showing the interaction between the EBS containing region of POD genes and EIN3 protein. GST-tagged EIN3 N-terminus fusion protein was incubated with biotin-labeled DNA fragment. Competition for the biotin-labeled promoter region was done by adding an excess of unlabeled wild-type probe (competitor) or mutated probe (mutant competitor). Two biological replicates and two technical replicates were performed with similar results.. . . . We next analyzed the promoter regions of two selected POD genes (At5g42180 and At2g18980) and found three EBSs in each promoter (Figure 6C). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using wild-type seedlings showed that the anti-EIN3 antibody bound strongly to the P2 fragment of At5g42180 and the P1 fragment of At2g18980 (Figure 6D) respectively, suggesting that EIN3 binds directly to the promoter regions of these genes in vivo. Furthermore, the promoter sequences of At5g42180 (P2) and At2g18980 (P1) were used for electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), showing that EIN3 can bind to these promoter sequences in vitro (Figure 6E). These results indicate that EIN3 increases peroxidase activity through the direct transcriptional regulation of PODs expression.. Peroxidases have been shown to participate in plant response against abiotic stresses as key scavengers of ROS [41]. The induction of several POD genes by EIN3 suggested that activation of EIN3 might facilitate the scavenging of ROS when plants are stressed with high salinity, thus leading to enhanced salt tolerance. To test this possibility, we determined the endogenous ROS accumulation and H2O2 content of wild-type Col-0, ein3eil1 and EIN3ox upon salt treatment. Salt treatment evidently increased ROS accumulation and H2O2 content in the cotyledons of Col-0, indicated by H2DCFA fluorescence [42], [43] and DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine) staining [44], respectively (Figure 7A-C). We further found higher level of ROS and H2O2 accumulation in ein3eil1 while lower level of ROS and H2O2 production in EIN3ox than that of Col-0 upon salt treatment (Figure 7A-C), in accordance with the salt tolerance phenotypes of these genotypes (Figure 1). Additionally, we found that upon salt treatment, a higher ROS accumulation (indicated by DAB staining and H2O2 contents) was found in sied1 mutant plants, while a significant decrease was observed in SIED1ox seedlings (Figure S14), suggesting that SIED1 acts to enhance salt tolerance also via reducing ROS accumulation.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004664.g007. Figure 7. . ROS accumulation in salt-treated Col-0, ein3eil1, EIN3ox and ebf2 plants.. (A) Fluorescence microscopy images of ROS (indicated by H2DCFDA fluorescence).

(B) DAB staining of seedlings under normal conditions or salt treatment. Seedlings grown on MS medium supplemented with or without 10 M ACC for 5 d were treated with 200 mM NaCl for 6 h, and used for DAB staining. (C) H2O2 content in the seedlings in (B) (Student's t test, *P<0.05 and **P<0.01). (D) qRT-PCR analysis of DEFL expression (a ROS marker gene) (Student's t test, *P<0.05 and **P<0.01).. . . . Since ACC-pretreated plants exhibited tolerance to salt stress, we next examined the effect of ACC pretreatment on ROS accumulation and H2O2 production in salt-treated plants. Compared with non-pretreated seedlings, ACC-pretreated Col-0 showed evident lower levels of ROS accumulation and H2O2 generation when stressed with high salinity (Figure 7A-C). Meanwhile, ROS level and H2O2 content remained constantly high in ein3eil1 and low in EIN3ox, and no obvious changes were found in these two genotypes upon ACC pretreatment (Figure 7A-C). These results are also in good correlation with their respective salt stress phenotypes with or without ACC pretreatment (Figure 1). We next examined the expression levels of a well-established ROS marker gene, DEFL (defensin-like), which was shown to be induced by various ROS [45]. In agreement with the histochemical observations of ROS accumulation, ACC-pretreated Col-0 seedlings accumulated less DEFL mRNA than non-pretreated Col-0 upon 3 h and 6 h of salt applications (Figure 7D). By contrast, DEFL expression was highly induced by salt stress in ein3 eil1 regardless of ACC pretreatment, whereas its expression levels remained constantly lower in salt-stressed EIN3ox and ebf2-1 than that in Col-0 (Figure 7D), further supporting the importance of EIN3 action in the modulation of salt-evoked ROS accumulation.. Taken together, our results indicate that activation of EIN3, either by EIN3 overexpression, ACC pretreatment, or EBF2 mutation, induces the expression of numerous POD and SIED genes, which arguably contributes to the decreased accumulation of ROS, and consequently the detoxification of salt stress-elicited damages..
PMC2920754	ResultsNuclear localization of AtSRT2Several HDACs are translocated to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Hollender and Liu 2008), which is consistent with their functions in modifying chromatin. AtSRT2 has seven predicted splice variants (see Supplementary Fig. S1A); however, only the third transcript (AtSRT2-CDS3), which lacks the two C-terminal exons, has been characterized (Pandey etal. 2002). We amplified the seven putative transcripts of AtSRT2 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and found that AtSRT2-CDS3 was the predominant splice variant (data not shown).Sequence analysis has demonstrated that AtSRT2-CDS3 contains a typical nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Pandey etal. 2002). To determine the subcellular localization of AtSRT2-CDS3, we fused AtSRT2-CDS3 in-frame to the 5 end of the green fluorescent protein (dGFP). The AtSRT2-CDS3-dGFP construct was introduced into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts by polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated DNA transfection (Yoo etal. 2007). Green fluorescence was detected in the whole cell transformed with the GFP control (Fig. 1, upper panel), whereas the AtSRT2-CDS3-dGFP fusion protein was expressed exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 1, lower panel), indicating that AtSRT2-CDS3 localizes to the nucleus.. Fig. 1Nuclear localization of AtSRT2-CDS3. Plasmids carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP control; upper panel) or AtSRT2-CDS3-GFP (bottom panel) were transformed into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Fluorescent images were taken at 16h after transfection. The nucleus was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Scale bar=10mum. The image is representative of experiments performed in triplicate.Expression profile of AtSRT2To determine the function of AtSRT2, we first evaluated its expression profile by fusing the AtSRT2 promoter to a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. The resulting construct (pAtSRT2-GUS) was transformed into Arabidopsis. Four independent transgenic lines with a single insertion were obtained, and GUS activity was detected in different organs and development stages (Fig. 2A-F). In particular, AtSRT2 promoter activity was high in roots (Fig. 2A, 2B), leaves (Fig. 2B, D) and flowers (Fig. 2E).. Fig. 2Expression profile of AtSRT2. beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detected by histochemistry in transgenic plants containing pAtSRT2-GUS. Typical GUS expression patterns are shown for (A) 3-day-old seedlings; (B) 6-day-old seedlings; (C) 12-day-old seedlings; (D) leaves from adult plants; (E) flowers; (F) siliques; (G) mock-treated leaves; and (H) leaves inoculated with PstDC3000. Scale bar=1mm. These images are representative of experiments performed in triplicate.To assess whether the expression of AtSRT2 is responsive to pathogen infection, we compared GUS activity in transgenic plants before and after virulent PstDC3000 inoculation. GUS activity was reduced after pathogen inoculation but not after mock treatment (Fig. 2G, H), which suggests that PstDC3000 infection represses AtSRT2 expression.Down-regulation of AtSRT2 by PstDC3000, inoculationThe down-regulation of AtSRT2 promoter activity by PstDC3000 infection (Fig. 2G, H) prompted us to evaluate the role of AtSRT2 in the plant basal defense. To gain more detailed insights into AtSRT2 expression upon PstDC3000 infection, we determined AtSRT2 mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR in PstDC3000-inoculated plants at different time points. As shown in Fig. 3A, pathogen infection markedly reduced AtSRT2 mRNA levels. Only about 30% of AtSRT2 transcripts remained at 24h after pathogen inoculation, which is consistent with our promoter activity assay results (Fig. 2).. Fig. 3AtSRT2 expression is repressed by pathogen infection. (A) Four-week-old WT Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were infiltrated with 10mM MgCl2 (open bars) or PstDC3000 (filled bars; OD600=0.2 in 10mM MgCl2). The infiltrated leaves were collected at the indicated time for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. (B) Four-week-old WT (Col-0), npr1-3 and NahG Arabidopsis plants were infiltrated with PstDC3000 (OD600=0.2 in 10mM MgCl2). The infiltrated leaves were collected at the indicated time for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. (C) Two-week-old WT (Col-0) seedlings grown on MS medium were untreated (open bars) or treated with 0.5mM salicylic acid (SA; filled bars). Seedlings were collected at the indicated time for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. UBQ10 was used as an internal control. Data represent the meanSD from four independent experiments. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05; **P<0.01.The SA-mediated signaling pathway regulated by NPR1 is one of the most important pathways in plant defense (Durrant and Dong 2004, Loake and Grant 2007). To assess the roles of SA and NPR1 in the pathogen-induced down-regulation of AtSRT2, we determined AtSRT2 mRNA levels in the npr1-3 mutant and SA-deficient NahG transgenic plants. As shown in Fig. 3B, AtSRT2 expression was still inhibited by PstDC3000 infection in npr1-3 mutants and NahG plants, indicating that AtSRT2 expression is not dependent on SA or NPR1. Consistent with this result, we also found that the AtSRT2 mRNA levels were not affected by exogenous SA treatment in WT plants (Fig. 3C).Disruption of AtSRT2 enhances plant basal defense and PR1 expressionTo characterize the functions of AtSRT2 invivo, we obtained a homozygous T-DNA insertion line (SALK_149295) for AtSRT2 from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). The precise insertion position was determined by PCR with primers specific to AtSRT2 and the T-DNA sequence, followed by sequencing of the PCR product. We found that SALK_149295 carries a T-DNA insertion in the second exon of AtSRT2 (see Supplementary Fig. S1A). AtSRT2 mRNA was not detected in the srt2 mutant by RT-PCR (see Supplementary Fig. S1B).The down-regulation of AtSRT2 by pathogen infection prompted us to investigate the potential role of AtSRT2 in regulating the plant basal defense. After inoculating the srt2 mutant and WT plants with PstDC3000, we compared bacterial growth rates. As shown in Fig. 4A, at 0day post-inoculation (dpi), srt2 and WT plants contained the same amount of PstDC3000, indicating equal initial bacterial doses. However, at 3dpi, the bacterial pathogen accumulated in the srt2 mutant was 10-fold lower than that of WT plants in three independent experiments, suggesting that the srt2 mutation enhanced the plant basal defense. PR genes have been widely used as markers of the plant basal defense system (Durrant and Dong 2004). We determined PR1 mRNA expression in PstDC3000-inoculated srt2 and WT plants by quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S2, PstDC3000 treatment induced PR1 expression strongly in both WT and mutant plants, and PR1 transcripts levels were higher in srt2 mutants at 3dpi compared with the WT.. Fig. 4The srt2 mutant is more resistant to pathogen infection. (A) WT (Col-0) plants and srt2 mutants were infiltrated with a suspension of PstDC3000 (OD600=0.0001 in 10mM MgCl2). Bacterial growth was determined at 0dpi (open bars) or 3dpi (filled bars). Each data point consisted of at least six samples. Error bars indicate the SD. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05. (B) Pathogen-induced PR1 expression. WT (Col-0) plats and srt2 mutants were infiltrated with a suspension of PstDC3000 (OD600=0.0001 in 10mM MgCl2). Total RNA was extracted at the time indicated for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. UBQ10 was used as internal control. Data represent the meanSD from three independent experiments. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05.Overexpression of AtSRT2-CDS3 compromises plant basal defense and PR1 expressionTo characterize further the function of AtSRT2 in the basal defense system, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress AtSRT2-CDS3. The AtSRT2-CDS3 full-length cDNA was cloned behind the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, and this construct was transformed into Arabidopsis plants. Three independent transgenic lines (OE2, OE7 and OE15) were chosen for further analysis. Our quantitative RT-PCR results revealed constitutively elevated expression of AtSRT2 in all the three transgenic plants, while the expression level of AtSRT2 in OE2 was lower than that in OE7 and OE15 (Fig. 5A).. Fig. 5Overexpression of AtSRT2-CDS3 attenuates the plant defense response. (A) AtSRT2 expression of 4-week-old WT (Col-0) and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. UBQ10 was used as an internal control. Data represent the meanSD from two independent experiments. (B) WT (Col-0) and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants were infiltrated with a suspension of PstDC3000 (OD600=0.0001 in 10mM MgCl2). Samples were taken at 0dpi (open bars) or 3dpi (filled bars) to determine bacterial growth. Each data point consisted of at least six samples. Error bars indicate the SD. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05. (C) Pathogen-induced PR1 expression. WT (Col-0) and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants (OE7 and OE15) were treated with a suspension of PstDC3000 (OD600=0.0001 in 10mM MgCl2). Inoculated leaves were collected for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. UBQ10 was used as internal control. Data represent the meanSD from three independent experiments. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05. (D) Two-week-old WT (Col-0), srt2 and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing (OE7 and OE15) Arabidopsis plants were treated with 0.5mM SA to induce PR1 expression. Total RNA was extracted at different time points for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. UBQ10 was used as internal control. Data represent the meanSD from two independent experiments.After PstDC3000 inoculation of plants, more bacterial pathogen was detected in the overexpressing transgenic lines compared with WT plants at 3dpi in three independent experiments (Fig. 5B), indicating that overexpression of AtSRT2-CDS3 made plants more susceptible to PstDC3000 infection. In addition, OE2 was susceptible to PstDC3000 at a similar level to that of OE7 and OE15, suggesting that pathogen susceptibility in overexpressing plants might be independent of the expression level of AtSRT2. Consistent with these findings, PR1 transcripts were reduced in the AtSRT2-overexpressing lines compared with WT plants (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S2). These results are consistent with our findings in the srt2 mutant. Thus, analysis of both loss-of-function AtSRT2 mutants and gain-of-function AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants indicates that AtSRT2 functions as a negative regulator in plant basal defense.Besides pathogen inoculation, we also analyzed SA-induced PR1 expression in WT, srt2 and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants to determine the mechanism by which AtSRT2 regulates the SA signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 5D, we did not see a significant difference in PR1 transcript levels among WT, srt2 mutant and overexpression plants, suggesting that AtSRT2 does not influence downstream gene expression in the presence of SA.AtSRT2 negatively regulates EDS5, PAD4 and SID2 expressionBiosynthesis of SA, which requires a series of enzymes, is an essential step in the plant defense against biotrophic pathogens (Shah 2003, Durrant and Dong 2004). We found that AtSRT2 repressed pathogen-induced PR1 expression but had little effect on SA-induced PR1 expression (Figs. 4B, 5C, D), suggesting that AtSRT2 is involved downstream of pathogen recognition but upstream of SA signaling. To better understand the role of AtSRT2 in SA biosynthesis in the plant basal defense system, we analyzed the expression of SA biosynthesis-related enzymes PAD4, EDS5 and SID2 under various conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, expression of PAD4, EDS5 and SID2 at 0dpi was higher in the srt2 mutant but lower in AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing lines compared with the WT, suggesting that these three genes are repressed by AtSRT2 even in the absence of pathogens. Treatment with PstDC3000 increased expression of PAD4, EDS5 and SID2, which is consistent with results of previous studies (Jirage etal. 1999, Wildermuth etal. 2001, Nawrath etal. 2002). Furthermore, pathogen-induced expression of all the three genes was significantly higher in srt2 plants but lower in AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing plants compared with the WT (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results indicate that AtSRT2 negatively regulates both basal and pathogen-induced expression of SA biosynthesis-related genes, possibly a determinant for its role in suppressing plant basal defense.. Fig. 6AtSRT2 negatively regulates EDS5, PAD4 and SID2 expression. Four-week-old WT (Col-0), srt2 and AtSRT2-CDS3-overexpressing (OE7 and OE15) Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with PstDC3000 (OD600=0.2 in 10mM MgCl2). Total RNA was extracted at the indicated time points for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of PAD4, EDS5 and SID2. UBQ10 was used as an internal control. Data represent the meanSD from three independent experiments. The statistical significance of the difference was confirmed by Students t-test, *P<0.05, **P<0.01..
PMC3688494	Results. . Sequencing of organelle RT-PCR products from leaf tissue of plants with altered expression of RIP family members. In order to evaluate the role of all 10 Arabidopsis RIP family members in editing of chloroplast and mitochondrial transcripts, we obtained mutants in 5 RIP family members from several different stock centers and performed Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) for RIP family members for which mutants were not available (Table 1). The rip1 mutant has a dwarf phenotype and the rip3 mutant exhibits a slight delay in development; the other mutants do not exhibit any phenotypic defect under growth room conditions (Figure 1). RNA was extracted from leaves of the mutants, wild-type or silenced plants, reverse-transcribed, and PCR was performed with primers that amplify all transcripts encoding either mitochondrial or chloroplast genes (Table S1). Nineteen plastid RT-PCR products were amplified that encompass known editing sites [2]; 34 mitochondrial known genes or ORFs were reverse transcribed because they were reported to contain editing sites [24]. Cox1 is the only mitochondrial gene not covered by our analysis because of its reported lack of editing sites [24]. We included 7 mitochondrial RT-PCR products that cover untranslated regions and contain reported editing sites [24] (Table S1). The RT-PCR amplicons were quantified and mixed in equimolar ratio for each plant. The cDNA mix was then sheared by ultra-sonication and used as a template for the production of an Illumina TruSeq RNA library. We refer to our method as strand-and transcript-specific RT-PCRseq (STS-PCRseq). Thirty libraries with different indexes, obtained from 7 mutants, 6 wild-types, 6 silenced, and two controls for the VIGS experiment were obtained (Table 2). One of the wt cDNA mixes was used twice to produce libraries with different indexes to test for the reproducibility of the measure of editing extent by RNA-seq (Table 2, see below).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.g001. Figure 1. . The rip1 mutant is the only mutant in our study with a severe defective phenotype.. . rip1, rip1-wt, rip3-2 and rip3-2-wt were grown under long-day growth room conditions (14 h light/10 h dark) while the other plants were grown in short day conditions (10 k light/14 h dark). rip3-2 mutant plants show a slight delay in development compared to their wild-type siblings. At the time of photography, 2 out of 8 (1/4) rip3-2 seedlings (30 days post-sowing) have flowered while all the wild-type seedlings have flowered (white spots in the middle of each plant are the flowers). rip4-1, rip4-2, and rip5-1 do not show any phenotypic difference with their wild-type (a rip5-1 wild-type was not available for the picture, but its genetic background is Columbia like rip4-2).. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.t002.

Biological replicates for some mutant and wild-type were analyzed to test for the variability of editing extent in our study. These biological replicates are libraries obtained from different plants of the same genotype grown at the same time and in the same conditions (Table 2). Unlike other libraries in this study, the libraries from biological replicates (L samples in Table 2 and Dataset S1) were sequenced in a pool of 12 libraries while other pools contained 24 libraries.. . . STS-DNA-seq identifies 656 organelle editing sites, among which 133 are new sites. The depth of the reads was surveyed for each library every 10 bp along each gene. A characteristic pattern is shown in Figure S1 for rip1. Amplicons whose size is smaller than the shearing cutoff (300 bp) showed a flat pattern of number of reads along the template (Figure S1A); amplicons whose size is larger than 300 bp exhibit either a drop in the number of reads in the middle of the template (Figure S1B) or a peak at the 5 or the 3 end of the template (Figures S1C, and D respectively). The drop in reads in the middle of the template can be explained by the non-randomness of the template shearing, which could generate more fragments with extremities if the break occurs only once inside the template. The reason for uneven distribution of reads at the 5 or 3 end of the template is unknown.. For each sample, we scanned all the 8320 C sites on the genomic templates to identify sites where the number of T bases in aligned reads was found to be statistically significant. The statistical significance was assessed using a likelihood ratio test comparing how well the observed alignment can be explained by assuming the absence of an edit and assuming an edit with certain proportion of T. The test used empirical mismatch rates calculated for each library from alignments. Details on this calculation and on the statistical test itself are given in protocol S1. Using this procedure, we identified 1833 sites where p-value was less than 1e-6 in at least one sample. These putative editing sites were filtered further by combining two additional criteria: the editing fraction (T/C+T) had to be larger than 0.05 in at least one sample and the average number of reads across all the samples had to be larger than 100.. DNA sequencing runs at the Cornell facility always contain controls to verify that the error rate is acceptably low. In addition to these routine controls, we spiked some of the samples with DNAs obtained from a plasmid preparation, a PCR amplification, and a RT-PCR amplification to empirically estimate the mismatch rate that occurs when each type of template undergoes sequencing. This empirical estimate, described in detail in Protocol S1 (section Estimating mismatch rates), involves aligning reads to their respective templates and collecting mismatch counts as functions of position on the read. As such, the empirical rates account for errors introduced at the experimental stage, detectable by the applied read alignment strategy. A representative result is given in Figure S2. The mismatch rates are in the order of 1e-4 for the plasmid preparation template; different mismatch rates between different pairs of bases are quite similar to each other (Figure S2A). Alignments to PCR (DNA) and RT-PCR (cDNA) spikes and to the whole genome (organelle genomic templates) give very similar ordering and values of mismatch rates (Figure S2B, C, and D). Except for the elevated A->G rate, these patterns are different from those seen for the plasmid preparation template (Figure S2A), and the values are 5-10 times higher, probably due to the errors introduced by the polymerases. The C->T mismatch rate derived from alignments to the whole genome (Figure S2D) is higher than in other cases since it contains contributions from some low-level CT editing sites which were not masked when the mismatch counts were collected (only the most obvious editing sites were masked). This elevated C->T mismatch rate makes our calls of CT editing sites more conservative. Overall, the total mismatch rate derived from PCR, RT-PCR and whole genome is quite low, approximately 1e-3 along the read.. We identified 656 editing sites in the filtered data, among which 37 are plastid and 619 are mitochondrial (Dataset S1). Five hundred and twenty-three of the editing sites identified in this analysis have been previously reported [2], [3], [13], [21], [24] (Dataset S2). These previously reported sites have a rather high average editing extent of 0.81 among the wild-type accessions. The proportion of silent sites, those which do not change the encoded amino acid, is low when compared to the non-silent sites, 17% vs. 83%, respectively (Dataset S2). In addition the average editing extent of silent sites is smaller than the average editing extent of non-silent sites, 0.44 vs. 0.89, respectively.. The average editing extent among the wild-type accessions of the 133 new editing sites identified in this study is only 0.07, which is markedly smaller than for the reported sites (Dataset S3). The proportion of silent sites in this population is higher than in the previously reported sites, 63% vs. 17%, respectively. Among the newly detected edited sites, the ranges and averages of editing extent among wild-type accessions between silent and non-silent sites are quite similar, 0.008-0.24 vs. 0.005-0.23 and 0.07 vs. 0.05, respectively (Dataset S3). The low-level editing we have detected might be considered accidental editing due to similarity of nearby sequences to cis-elements that are present upstream of other, more highly edited C targets. We looked for similarity of sequences surrounding these new sites (-20 +5) with previously reported sites. Thirty four new editing sites exhibit similarity (10 nt) in their putative cis sequences to reported sites (Dataset S3). Examples of similar putative cis elements between three new editing sites and some reported sites is given in Figure 2. We also examined the lists of editing sites in three other species, Lotus japonicus, rice and tobacco, to determine whether any of the new Arabidopsis C targets had been identified in other well-characterized organelle transcriptomes. 8, 5 and 1 of these new sites have been reported in tobacco, rice, and Lotus, respectively (Dataset S3). Overall, 12 of these new Arabidopsis editing sites are also present in the other species that have been analyzed.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.g002. Figure 2. . Examples of newly identified editing sites having sequences in their putative cis elements similar to known editing sites.. The sequences shown are 20 nt upstream and 5 nt downstream around the target C for editing (underlined and capitalized). Other Cs that are edited are underlined. The upper (lower) sequence belongs to a new (known) editing site. The names of the sites are given on the right of each sequence with the average editing extent found in the wild-type in between parentheses. Identical sequences are highlighted by red squares. Upon visual inspection, gaps were introduced in order to increase the similarity between cis elements.. . . . Three new plastid editing sites were also identified in this study; they all lie on the ndhB transcript at position 153, 708 and 726 (Dataset S2). We assayed two of these new sites, ndhB-708 and ndhB-726, by poisoned primer extension (PPE). The PPE analysis confirmed the existence of editing at these locations and validated the RNA-seq finding that the rip1 and rip3 mutants and their wild-type siblings exhibited higher editing extent at these two sites than did the Columbia GFP-expressing transgenic line that was used in the VIGS experiments, which exhibited only 15% editing (Figure 3).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.g003. Figure 3. . Validation by PPE of two plastid sites detected by RNA-seq.. (A) Acrylamide gels separate the PPE products obtained from some samples used in this study; -/-, T-DNA mutant; +/+, wild-type. E, edited; P, primer; U, unedited. The name of the site assayed is given above each gel. (B) The quantification of editing extent derived from the measure of the band's intensity is represented by a bar below each lane of the acrylamide gels.. . . . The sensitivity of deep sequencing over conventional methods such as RT-PCR bulk sequencing to detect editing is supported by the finding of numerous new sites. A T peak (which should be present in the edited faction) in sequencing electrophoretograms is often absent at sites whose editing extent is assayed at 10% by deep sequencing (Figure S3). Thus, the threshold of editing extent detection by bulk sequencing can be estimated to be around 10% and this low level of sensitivity explains why the new sites, whose average editing extent is 7%, were not detected before the use of deep sequencing.. . . Validation of the RNA-seq method to assess organelle RNA editing. In order to assess the reliability of the measure of editing extent by deep sequencing, we performed 226 PPE assays on either mitochondrial or plastid C targets. The correlation between the PPE assay, which is known to be the most robust measurement of editing extent and deep sequencing, was found to be >0.95 (Figure 4A). The slight discrepancy between PPE and deep sequencing concerns the absolute value of editing extent, which tends to be smaller when assayed by Illumina sequencing (Figure 4A). The reproducibility of editing extent measurement by deep sequencing was tested by using the same sheared cDNA to construct two libraries with different indexes, s18 and a13 respectively (Figure 4B). The correlation between these two experiments is >0.99, demonstrating the reproducibility of editing extent measurement by deep sequencing of RT-PCR products.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.g004. Figure 4. . Measurement of RNA editing extent by RNA-seq is accurate and highly reproducible.. (A) The editing extent of 226 organelle editing events, 106 mitochondrial :9 sites and 3 to 19 genotypes assayed per site and 120 plastid: 12 sites and 7 to 11 genotypes assayed per site, was measured by RNA-seq and PPE assay. A high correlation with PPE assay (R2=0.97), the most precise method to measure editing extent, demonstrates the robustness of RNA-seq to evaluate organelle editing extent. (B) Two libraries with different indexes were prepared from the same sheared cDNA obtained from rip1 mutant. The editing extent measured between the two libraries shows a very high correlation (R2>0.99).. . . . We included in our analysis 8 biological replicates corresponding to 4 rip mutants and 4 wild-type accessions. Libraries were made from cDNA obtained from different plants grown in the same conditions (Table 2). The variability of editing extent between these biological replicates is negligible as demonstrated by the very high correlation found for each pairwise comparison (Figure 5).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.g005. Figure 5. . Biological replicates exhibit a high correlation of editing extent.. Each graph represents a pairwise comparison of editing extent that was measured on two libraries obtained from cDNAs of two plants belonging to the same genotype grown in the same conditions and harvested at the same time.. . . . . . Analysis of a rip1 mutant by STS-PCRseq confirms RIP1 to be a major editing factor and validates the new editing sites. In mitochondria of a rip1 T-DNA insertional mutant, 368 sites were previously surveyed by bulk sequencing; 108 of these sites or ca 29% were found to exhibit a pronounced reduction of editing extent, while 72% showed a detectable decrease of editing extent in the bulk sequencing electrophoretograms [12]. We now report the characterization of this mutant's organelle RNA editing extent by deep sequencing. The quantitative nature of the Illumina sequencing assay allowed us to measure the effect of RIP1 on the editing extent of a particular site according to the variation of editing extent (deltaEE) observed in the rip1 mutant relative to the wt: deltaEE=(wt-rip1)/wt. We tested by a chi-square test for the significance of a difference in the editing fraction in rip1 mutant vs. wild-type. We adopted the Bonferroni correction to account for repetitive testing, which is a simple way to control the familywise error rate (alpha) by simply dividing it by the number of comparisons (n) to derive the nominal threshold for each test (beta=alpha/n). In the case of mitochondrial sites, comparisons of 619 sites were made between the rip1 mutant and its wild-type sibling; therefore, a nominal threshold of 1.6e-6 was chosen in order to achieve an overall significance of 1e-3. We classified the sites into two categories depending on the result of the chi-square test and the value of deltaEE. If the site exhibited P (chisq) >1.6 e-6, we included this site in the rip1-independent class. Otherwise, the site was classified as rip1-independent if deltaEE<0.1 or rip1-dependent if deltaEE0.1. Overall, the percentages of rip1-dependent sites are very similar between the bulk-sequencing and the deep-sequencing studies, 72% vs. 77% respectively ([12] and Table 3). The deep-sequencing data confirmed the biased distribution of rip1-dependent sites according to the mitochondrial complex to which the site belongs. For instance, there is a marked excess of rip1-dependent sites in cytochrome c biogenesis and ribosomal transcripts, 90% and 89%, respectively (Table 3). On the other hand, the excess of rip1-dependent sites is less pronounced in the complex I transcripts (57%, Table 3). The mttb transcript carries by far the highest proportion of rip1-dependent sites (98%, Table 3).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.t003. Table 3. .

Splitting the analysis of rip1-dependent and independent mitochondrial sites between the reported and the new sites shows a very similar effect of the rip1 mutation on both types of sites (Table 3). The proportion of sites affected by the rip1 mutation is not statistically different in the reported sites compared to the new sites, 78% vs. 72%, respectively (Table 3, P=0.13). Moreover, the distribution of RIP1-dependent and independent classes in the mitochondrial complexes shows a good agreement between the reported sites and the new sites (Table 3).. The data confirmed RIP1 as a major component of the plant editing machinery: 474 mitochondrial sites or 77% and 8 plastid sites or 22% showed a deltaEE>0.1 (Tables 4 and 5). Among the plastid sites, petL-5 showed the most pronounced reduction of editing extent in the rip1 mutant (deltaEE=0.81, Table S2). Unlike the mitochondrial editing sites, comparison of the variation between the Illumina-sequencing assay of chloroplast transcript editing extent in the rip1 mutant to the previous results obtained by PPE exhibited some discrepancies between the two studies (Table S2). Four sites, petL-5, accD-794, rpl23-89, and ndhD-878, exhibited lower editing extent in the current study, while the rps12-intron, and rpoC1-488, had a consistent increase of editing extent relative to the prior PPE findings (Table S2). On the other hand, sites in the rpoB transcript and ndhF-290 exhibited lower extent by STC-PCRseq, while they were invariant or had an increase of editing extent when assayed by PPE. Given that we have proven that deep sequencing is a reliable way to measure editing extent, the discrepancy between the two studies is likely to be linked to the RNA samples, which were taken from two different sets of plants for use in the plastid editing assays. We therefore performed PPE on the new RNA samples that were used in our Illumina sequencing study. When 8 of the C targets that exhibited the greatest variation between the two studies were assayed by PPE, there was an increase in the correlation of the PPE assay and the deep sequencing from 0.55 to 0.82 and 0.62 to 0.81 for the rip1 mutant and wild-type, respectively (Figure S4), indicating that a difference in editing extent exists in the RNA samples, likely due to environmental factors and/or developmental stage.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.t004.

The majority of sites controlled by RIP3 and RIP8, two moderately important mitochondrial factors, overlap with the sites under RIP1 control. We studied two rip3 T-DNA mutants (GK-109E12.01 and SAIL_156_A04) and their wild-type siblings by STS-PCRseq (Table 1). RIP3 can be considered a moderately important mitochondrial editing factor because of the number of sites it controls. There are 183 sites that exhibit a deltaEE0.1 in rip3-1 and 201 in rip3-2, while the rip1 mutant has 474 sites with altered editing extent (Table 4). We investigated what proportion of the sites was controlled by RIP1 alone, RIP3 alone, both of them, or neither of them (Table S3). A chi-square test demonstrates that the effects of RIP1 and RIP3 on mitochondrial editing extent cannot be considered statistically independent (P<10-4). There is an excess of observed sites controlled by both factors (deltaEE0.1), and an excess of observed sites not controlled by any factor (deltaEE<0.1) compared to the number of sites expected in case of independence (Table S3). Therefore, our data indicate a synergistic effect of these two factors on mitochondrial editing extent. The survey of plastid sites in both rip3 mutants indicates that some sites are significantly reduced in editing extent, especially in rip3-2 (Table 5); however these sites are not common between the two mutants and thus can be dismissed as not caused by the mutation. The reason for these sites being specifically reduced in one mutant but not the other are not clear but rpoC1-488, the site showing the most reduced editing extent in rip3-2 is the most variable site in other rip mutants, where it shows an increase of editing extent compared to the wild-type (Table S2). Unlike the plastid sites, the vast majority of mitochondrial sites, ca 90% (163/183) that are significantly decreased in editing extent in the rip3-1 mutant exhibit also a significant decrease of editing extent in the rip3-2 mutant.. The T-DNA insertional mutant we obtained in RIP8 is embryo lethal in the homozygous state. We therefore used VIGS to knock down the expression of this gene. Because VIGS in Arabidopsis is sometimes inefficient, we silence Arabidopsis plants carrying a GFP gene, and screen for leaf tissue on silenced plants that exhibit loss of GFP fluorescence, as the gene of interest is then also found to be silenced. Two types of control plants were used in this experiment: uninoculated plants and plants inoculated with a silencing vector containing only GFP (libraries a4 and a3, respectively, Table 2). 33 mitochondrial sites and 1 plastid site exhibited a significant reduction of editing extent in the GFP-silenced control when compared to the uninoculated plants and were discarded in the analysis of silenced plants. Sites significantly reduced in the rip8-silenced plants vs. uninoculated plants were further checked against the GFP-silenced control.. Like RIP3, RIP8 can be considered a moderately important mitochondrial editing factor; 74 sites exhibit a deltaEE0.1 in RIP8 silenced plants (Table 4). The number of affected sites is likely to be underestimated because silencing does not completely eliminate expression. Our data indicate that the effect of RIP1 and RIP8 on mitochondrial editing is not independent, although the deviation from independence is less pronounced for them than for RIP3 and RIP8 (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively, Table S4). Like for the pair (RIP1, RIP3), each pair of mitochondrial factors, (RIP1, RIP8) or (RIP3, RIP8) shows an excess of observed sites controlled by both factors (deltaEE0.1), and an excess of observed sites not controlled by any factor (deltaEE<0.1) compared to the number of sites expected in case of independence (Table S4).. Analysis of the overlapping effects of RIP1, RIP3 and RIP8 on mitochondrial editing demonstrates that the majority of sites controlled by RIP3 and RIP8 are also controlled by RIP1 (Figure 6). The proportion of sites controlled either by RIP8 or RIP3 that are also controlled by RIP1 is remarkably similar, 112/127 or 88% and 161/183 (175/201) or 88% (87%), respectively (number in parenthesis refer to rip3-2) (Figure 6). Sites controlled by only one factor are predominantly found in RIP1-controlled sites whereas they represent only a small fraction in RIP3 and RIP8-controlled sites (Figure 6).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.g006. Figure 6. . Relative importance of RIPs on mitochondrial editing.. (A) Number of mitochondrial sites under the control of RIPs (deltaEE0.1, P<1.6 e-6). RIP8 results were obtained from VIGS (all the mitochondrial sites were counted in this analysis). Numbers of sites for RIP3 refer to rip3-1 (rip3-2). (B) Examples of mitochondrial sites falling into one of the eight categories described in the Venn diagram shown in (A). The background color reflects the range of editing extent from red (low: 0-0.2) to dark green (high: 0.8-1).. . . . . . A majority of plastid sites controlled by RIP2 are also under the control of RIP9 and vice versa. . RIP2 and RIP9 are both located in plastids. RIP2 was shown to be imported in vitro into chloroplasts [25] and RIP9 has been found in the stromal proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts [26]. We investigated the role of the RIP2 and RIP9 genes in plastid editing by silencing them and comparing the editing extent in silenced plants vs. control plants. 22 plastid sites among 36 surveyed (61%), show a reduction in editing extent 0.1 in RIP2-silenced plants (Tables 5 and S5). We also observed that 21 mitochondrial editing sites exhibit a reduction in editing extent 0.1 in RIP2-silenced plants (Tables 4 and S6).. In RIP9-silenced plants, 24 (67%) plastid sites exhibit reduced editing extent 0.1 when compared to the uninoculated control plants (Tables 5 and S7). We also detected a reduction in editing of 1 mitochondrial site (deltaEE0.1) in the RIP9-silenced plants (Table 4).. The effects of RIP2 and RIP9 on plastid editing extent are statistically independent (Table S8). However, RIP2 and RIP9 overlap in their control of plastid editing extent; 15 sites are under the control of both RIP2 and RIP9 (Figure 7). The proportion of sites controlled by only one plastid factor are 25% (2/8), 23% (5/22), and 29% (7/24) for RIP1, RIP2, and RIP9, respectively.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003584.g007. Figure 7. . Relative importance of RIPs on plastid editing.. (A) Number of plastid sites under the control of RIPs (deltaEE0.1, P 2.7<10-5). RIP2 and RIP9 results were obtained from VIGS. (B) Examples of plastid sites falling into one of the eight categories described in the Venn diagram shown in (A). The background color reflects the range of editing extent from red (low: 0-0.2) to dark green (high: 0.8-1).. . . . . . Other members of the RIP family exhibit only minor effects on RNA editing in mutants and silenced plants. We analyzed the remaining members of the RIP family, RIP4, RIP5, RIP6, RIP7, and RIP10 (Table 1). For RIP4, we studied two T-DNA insertional mutants, rip4-1 and rip4-2. RIP5 was analyzed both in a T-DNA insertional mutant, rip5-1 and in VIGS plants. In our comparison of editing between mutant and wild-type, we compared the wild-type sibling to the mutant, except for RIP6, for which we had data only for the mutant. RIP7 and RIP10 were analyzed only in plants that had undergone VIGS.. . RIP4, RIP5, RIP6, RIP7, and RIP10 affect a small number of mitochondrial editing sites and none of the plastid sites except for one plastid site affected in RIP10 silenced leaves (Tables 4 and 5). CcmFc-1150 is the only site that was found to have reduced editing extent in both rip4 mutants. Among the 12 sites that show a significant reduction of editing extent (deltaEE0.1) in rip5-silenced plants, two sites also exhibit a significant reduction in rip5 mutant plants (Table S9). Among the 6 editing sites that exhibit a significant reduction of editing extent (deltaEE0.1) in rip7-silenced plants, half are on the nad3 transcript (Table S10).. Because rip6 wild-type sibling data was not available, in order to establish the basis for comparison of the rip6 mutant plant's editing extent to wild-type, we estimated the wild-type level by averaging the editing extent found in the wild-type siblings of rip3, rip4, and rip5 plants and the Columbia accession used for VIGS. Because approximately 80% of the mitochondrial sites show a significant difference of editing extent among Columbia accessions (P(chi2)<10-6), we did not consider these sites in our rip6 mutant analysis. We did not find any site with a significant reduction in rip6 plants (data not shown),. Some of the mutants analyzed in this study have been analyzed by bulksequencing [13]. Our results are in very good agreement with those previous data; for instance all the sites significantly reduced in rip3-1 mutant and that show a difference in editing with the wild-type >0.25 were also detected by bulksequencing [13]. There are, however, some slight differences between the two studies, which are summarized in Table S11..
PMC4495618	Results. We report the step-by-step protocol of Arabidopsis pin-fasten grafting. Arabidopsis wild-type or gl1-1 plants were grown under long- or short-day conditions. Insect pins were inserted into gl1-1 scions at different developmental stages for grafting onto epicotyls or hypocotyls of stocks. Successfully grafted scions with newly developed glabrous leaves were observed at 14days after grafting. Further longitudinal sections of the graft union showed well-connected vascular tissues between grafted plants. Use of fluorescent phloem-limited dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate in grafted plants demonstrated a symplastic connection established at 6days after grafting and almost fully developed at 8days..
PMC4044311	RESULTS. . ATG9 is not strictly essential for autophagy but affects autophagic flux. To investigate the requirement of ATG9 for autophagy in Arabidopsis, we used two atg9 alleles, designated atg9-3 and atg9-4. The atg9-3 and atg9-4 alleles have a T-DNA insertion in exon 6 and in the 5 end of exon 8, respectively, of the single-copy ATG9 gene (Supplementary Fig. S1). Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis detected no ATG9 transcript flanking the T-DNA insertion in atg9-3 and atg9-4, indicating that they are null for functional ATG9 transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S1D).. We initially crossed the atg9 mutants with transgenic plants carrying the pro35S-GFP-ATG8a transgene (Thompson et al., 2005), a popular marker for the autophagosome and autophagic bodies. However, we observed a marked reduction in GFP signal in the progeny produced from the crosses, compared to GFP from the original pro35S-GFP-ATG8a transgenic line (data not shown). The reduction likely resulted from transgene silencing, because the presence of cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in T-DNA tagging mutants often represses trans-gene expression driven by the same promoter (Daxinger et al., 2008). Thus, we decided to use an alternative marker, proUBQ10-GFP-ATG8a (Kim et al., 2013), which contains the promoter of Arabidopsis UBQ10 gene instead of the 35S promoter. We crossed the proUBQ10-GFP-ATG8a transgenic plants with atg9-3 and atg9-4, and their F2 individuals were genotyped to obtain atg9 mutants containing the transgene. The proUBQ10-GFP-ATG8a seedlings with WT, atg7-2, atg9-3, or atg9-4 background were incubated in liquid medium containing either CA or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent control. CA is frequently used to stabilize vacuolar GFP-ATG8a puncta, which are interpreted as autophagic bodies (Yoshimoto et al., 2004). Confocal microscopy of DMSO-treated WT and atg9 roots (Fig. 1A) revealed a diffuse GFP-ATG8a signal in the cytoplasm, except for the occasional puncta that may show phagophores or autophagosomes. The CA-treated WT vacuole contained numerous GFP-ATG8a-labeled autophagic bodies, while the atg7-2 vacuole did not contain GFP-ATG8a puncta, as previously reported (Chung et al., 2010). GFP-ATG8a puncta were detected in the vacuole of CA-treated atg9 seedlings, although they were not as abundant as in the WT (Fig. 1A).. To monitor autophagic flux in atg9 seedlings, we carried out the GFP-ATG8 processing assay (Klionsky et al., 2012). This assay is routinely used to study autophagy in yeast and is based on the fact that GFP-ATG8 in the vacuole is processed to generate free GFP which is more stable than GFP-ATG8. Autophagy-deficient mutants typically lack free GFP, whereas the inhibition of vacuolar degradation results in accumulation of free GFP and GFP-ATG8. Although the assay can be used for plant cells (Chung et al., 2010; Suttangkakul et al., 2011), there is a potential problem with this method. In atg5-1 mutants expressing the conventional autophagic marker pro35S-GFP-ATG8a (Thompson et al., 2005), we often detected a faint protein band (Fig. 1B, lane 3) that co-migrated with the free GFP band in the WT extract (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Interestingly, when we used proUBQ10-GFP-ATG8a for anti-GFP immunoblot analysis (Figs. 1B and 1C), we identified three protein bands with different mobility in SDS-PAGE: one band at the predicted size of GFP-ATG8a, and two faster bands similar to the size of free GFP moiety. The WT had the fastest band, atg7-2 had a smear band with slightly slower mobility (indicated by asterisks in Figs. 1B and 1C), and atg9-3 and atg9-4 included both. In the WT, the intensity of the fastest protein band was increased by nitrogen limitation and further by CA treatment. These increases suggest that this band represents a processed GFP species that is more stable than GFP-ATG8a in the vacuole and is thus a true indicator of autophagic flux. This protein species was designated GFPAP (for autophagy-dependent, processed GFP). In contrast, the slower band appeared to be associated with inefficient autophagy, as it was rarely detectable in the WT but more noticeable in atg9-3, atg9-4, and atg7-2; this protein species was designated GFPIP (for autophagy-independent, processed GFP). Although GFPIP level was slightly increased by nitrogen limitation in atg7 and atg9 mutants, it was not increased by CA (Fig. 1C, smear bands indicated by asterisk), showing that GFPIP is not associated with the vacuole and cannot be considered an indicator of autophagic flux.. Compared to WT, atg9 seedlings contained a lower level of GFPAP (Figs. 1B and 1C), indicating reduced autophagic flux in the mutants. The atg9 mutants showed a WT-like increase in GFPAP in response to nitrogen limitation, but unlike the WT, CA treatment had only a minor effect on GFPAP levels in these mutants (Fig. 1C). Since CA mainly acts after the fusion of the autophagosome with the vacuole, this result suggested that ATG9 acts in an early step before the fusion event.. We further tested the hypothesis that GFPAP is a product of vacuolar degradation. Tamura et al. (2003) reported that GFP tagged with a C-terminal vacuolar-targeting signal is processed in the vacuole, and that a processed GFP moiety was stabilized when plants were incubated in the dark. Consistent with our hypothesis, the abundance of GFPAP, but not of GFPIP, was increased when proUBQ10p-GFP-ATG8a plants were incubated in the dark (Fig. 2).. . . Phenotypes of atg9 differ from those of atg7 and atg2. We compared atg7, atg2, and atg9 for hypersensitivity to nutrient limitation, which is the canonical phenotype of autophagy-defective Arabidopsis mutants (Doelling et al., 2002; Hanaoka et al., 2002; Inoue et al., 2006). As expected from our analysis of autophagy, atg7-2 and atg2-1 showed hypersensitivity to fixed carbon limitation (Chung et al., 2010), but atg9 seedlings did not (Fig. 3A). Phenotypic differences between atg9 and other core atg mutants were also seen for phenotypes associated with pexophagy, a selective type of autophagy preferentially targeting peroxisomes for degradation (Kim et al., 2013). Degradation of isocitrate lyase (ICL), a peroxisomal matrix enzyme, was shown to be delayed in atg7 and atg5 hypocotyls (Kim et al., 2013). Delayed degradation was also confirmed in atg2-1 hypocotyls (Fig. 3B), consistent with a recent report that another atg2 allele suppressed defects in peroxisomal functions (Farmer et al., 2013). ICL degradation was also delayed in atg9 hypocotyls (Fig. 3B), although atg7-2 and atg2-1 contained a higher level of ICL at day 9 than atg9 did. These phenotypic data were consistent with our observation that autophagic flux was fully compromised in atg7 and atg2 but not in atg9.. . . Wortmannin blocks autophagic flux. To determine whether PI 3-kinase activity is required for autophagy in plant cells, we tested the effect of wortmannin (WM), an inhibitor of mammalian and plant PI 3-kinases (Matsuoka et al., 1995). We incubated pro35S-GFP-ATG8a transgenic seedlings in liquid medium containing CA for various durations; the effect of CA on the level of free GFP was prominent after 16 h of incubation (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Next, we incubated the transgenic plants in liquid medium containing either DMSO or CA and various amounts of WM for 16 h and found that 10-30 muM WM dampened the effect of CA on free GFP (Supplementary Figs. S2B and S2C). However, only a slight reduction in free GFP was seen in transgenic seedlings treated with 30 muM WM alone for 16 h, compared to DMSO control (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and no treatment control at 0 h (Supplementary Fig. S2D). These results suggested that PI 3-kinase activity is required for either vacuolar targeting of GFP-ATG8a or for stabilization of free GFP by CA.. To gain insight into the relationship between different core ATG complexes in plants, we further investigated the effects of CA and WM on the autophagic markers in various mutant backgrounds. We compared confocal images of proUBQ10-GFP-ATG8a transgenic roots of WT, atg7-2, atg9-3, and atg9-4 background that were treated with DMSO, CA, WM, or the combination of CA and WM (Fig. 4A). The effect of CA in WT and atg9 was markedly diminished by treatment with WM, indicating that efficient delivery of GFP-ATG8a to the vacuole relies on PI 3-kinase activity. In WM-treated WT and atg9 cells, most GFP-ATG8a signal appeared to be diffuse in the cytosol and to occasionally form cytoplasmic foci, but almost no signal was detected in atg9 vacuoles. No GFP-ATG8a puncta were detected in the vacuoles of autophagy-defective negative control atg7-2 treated with CA and WM.. We also investigated the effect of WM on autophagic flux. The GFP-ATG8 processing assay was performed using crude extracts prepared from whole seedlings that were treated with DMSO, CA, WM, or combination of CA and WM (Figs. 4B and 4C). We not only confirmed the absence of GFPAP in atg7-2 (Fig. 4C, lanes 5-8) and the presence of both GFPAP and GFPIP in atg9 (Fig. 4B, lanes 5-7), but also observed a small amount of GFPIP in WM-treated WT samples (Figs. 4B and 4C; lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that WM blocked a step in autophagy. In the WT, WM treatment increased the level of GFP-ATG8a but not that of GFPAP (Figs. 4B and 4C; lanes 1 and 4), while CA treatment enhanced the intensity of both GFP-ATG8a and GFPAP (Figs. 4B and 4C; lanes 1 and 2). WM treatment also suppressed the effect of CA on GFPAP accumulation (Figs. 4B, C; lanes 2 and 3). Combined with the confocal microscopy data, these immunoblot data indicated that WM interferes with the targeting of cytoplasmic GFP-ATG8a-PE to the vacuole for processing to GFPAP and then full degradation. GFPAP was largely depleted in atg9-3 seedlings by WM treatment alone (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 8), although CA stabilized a trace amount of GFPAP (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). The additional inhibition by WM in atg9 is consistent with the notion that ATG9 belongs to a different class from the autophagy-specific PI 3-kinase complex in Arabidopsis. In conclusion, the collective data confirmed that WM-sensitive PI 3-kinase activity and ATG9 contribute to efficient autophagic flux, especially in early autophagic process prior to the fusion of the autophagosome with the vacuole (Fig. 4)..
PMC3533798	Results. . SnRK2.4 and -2.10 are among the fastest activated protein kinases in Arabidopsis roots upon salt stress. To investigate their possible role in salt stress signalling, activation of SnRK2.4 and -2.10 was studied in A. thaliana roots. Plants grown hydroponically for 28 days were transferred to control or saline medium, and kinase activity was monitored using an in-gel kinase assay on root protein extracts. To identify SnRK2.4 and -2.10 activation and to determine their roles in salt-related signalling, two independent T-DNA insertion lines were isolated for both kinases (snrk2.4-1, Salk_080588; snrk2.4-2, Salk_146522; snrk2.10-1, WiscDsLox233E9; snrk2.10-2, GABI_676G12) (Figure S1a in Supporting Information). Using an anti-SnRK2 (alphaSnRK2) antibody (Boudsocq et al., 2004) these mutants were confirmed to be knock-outs at the protein level (Figure S1b).. Activation of SnRK2.4 and -2.10 was studied in roots of hydroponically grown plants that had been stressed by transfer to different salt concentrations ranging between 100 and 150 mm NaCl or 200 mm mannitol (Figure 1a and Figure S2b). Crude protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE with the generic protein kinase substrate myelin basic protein (MBP) immobilized in the gel. Myelin basic protein can be phosphorylated by several protein kinase families, including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPKs) and SnRK2s (Boudsocq et al., 2004; Droillard et al., 2002; Munnik et al., 1999), allowing visualization of the activity of the endogenous kinases. Two kinases with molecular weights of 45 and 48 kDa (presumably MAPKs) are activated between 2 min and 24 h (48 kDa) and 5 min and 6 h (45 kDa) in response to 150 mm NaCl (Figure 1a, upper panel). At the expected molecular weight of SnRK2.4 and -2.10 (40 kDa), a fast and transient activation of a protein kinase was observed (indicated by an arrow) between 30 sec and 5 min and the activation increased again after 24 h. To determine whether this protein kinase activity represented SnRK2.4, -2.10 or both, immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with an antibody that recognizes both SnRK2.4 and -2.10 (Vlad et al., 2010) and the protein kinase activity was analysed by an in-gel kinase assay (Figure 1a, second panel). In addition, kinase activation was investigated in the snrk2.4, snrk2.10 and snrk2.4/2.10 mutant backgrounds after a 2-min salt stress (Figure 1b). As shown in Figure 1a, the activation kinetics of the immunoprecipitated SnRK2s resembled the activation pattern observed at 40 kDa in the crude extract. Activation was very fast (<0.5 min), peaking at 1 min, and was rapidly repressed, but reappeared after 24 h. The identity of SnRK2.4 and -2.10 as the 40 kDa band in the crude extract was confirmed in the snrk2.4/2.10 mutant background, where the 40 kDa band was completely absent after 2 min of salt stress. SnRK2.4 and -2.10 were activated to a similar degree since the 40 kDa kinase activity was similar in both single mutants (Figure 1b). Western blot analysis with the same antibody on the crude extract showed that there were no changes in protein abundance up to 6 h of salt treatment (Figure 1a, third panel). No kinase activation was observed when plants were transferred to control medium (Figure S2a). A similar activation pattern was observed when 200 mm mannitol was used (Figure S2b), indicating that SnRK2.4 and -2.10 are activated in Arabidopsis roots in response to salt and osmotic stress.. . Figure 1. . SnRK 2.4 and -2.10 are among the fastest activated protein kinases in Arabidopsis thaliana roots upon salt stress. (a) In-gel kinase assay of protein extracts from hydroponically grown roots exposed to 150 mm NaCl. In the upper panel (crude extract, activity) the activity of a number of kinases is detected. At 40 kDa the activation of SnRK2.4 and -2.10 is observed (indicated with an arrow). In the second panel, in-gel kinase activity is shown after immunoprecipitation (IP) with an antibody against SnRK2.4/2.10, confirming the identity of these bands to be SnRK2.4/2.10. In the third panel, the western blot analysis shows SnRK2.4 and -2.10 protein abundances at the different time-points and in the lower panel coomassie brilliant blue is shown as a loading control. (b) SnRK2.4 and 2.10 are responsible for the kinase activity observed at 40 kDs. The same approach as shown in (a) was conducted in the single and double mutant background after 2 min of 150 mm salt stress. All the protein kinase assays were performed with myelin basic protein immobilized in the gel as substrate.. . . . . . SnRK2.4 and -2.10 play a role in maintaining root growth under saline conditions. In Arabidopsis, salinity been shown to cause changes in the root system architecture (Zhao et al., 2011; Zolla et al., 2010), allowing plants to optimize their growth under this condition. To assess whether the SnRK2 protein kinases play a role in this response, primary root length and lateral root density (LRD) were studied in the snrk2.4 and -2.10 mutants, in both control and saline conditions (85 or 115 mm NaCl) (Figure 2). To avoid any problems with sucrose affecting root growth through direct uptake via the leaves (Macgregor et al., 2008), media were prepared without sucrose.. . Figure 2. . SnRK2.4 and -2.10 are involved in maintaining primary and lateral root growth, respectively, in saline conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana seeds of Col-0, snrk2.4-1, snrk2.4-2, snrk2.10-1, snrk2.10-2 and snrk2.4/2.10 were sown on agar plates containing  MS. The plants were grown vertically under an angle of 70. After 4 days the seedlings were transferred either to control or plates supplemented with 85 or 115 mm salt. Plates were scanned and the primary root length (from the point of transfer to the root tip) and the lateral root density (LRD) were measured 8 days after the transfer (12-day-old seedlings) using image analysis software and counting of visual lateral roots. The primary root length (left panel) and the LRD (number of lateral roots/cm primary root, right panel) were averaged. The number of replicates varied between 20 and 30 replicates per line and concentration and seedlings were randomized over different plates. The phenotypes were confirmed in three independent studies. The error bars represent the standard error and significant differences were determined using Tukey-b and are indicated by letters (P  0.05).. . . . Under control conditions, there were no differences in primary root length when Col-0 wild type and all mutants were compared (Figure 2, left column). The addition of 85 mm NaCl to the growth medium did not change this, but when exposed to 115 mm NaCl, significant differences between the wild type and the snrk2.4 mutant lines (snrk2,4-1, snrk2.4-2) appeared. A reduction of 35% in the primary root length was detected in snrk2.4-1, snrk2.4-2 and the snrk2.4-1/2.10-1 double mutant, whereas the wild type and the snrk2.10 lines showed a reduction of only 20% when exposed to salt.. When studying the LRs (Figure 2, right column), no differences in LRD were observed between wild type and the mutants in control conditions. Col-0 showed a reduction in LRD of 20% at 85 mm NaCl in comparison to control conditions. In the snrk2.10-1 and snrk2.10-2 single mutants, a significantly greater reduction was observed, showing a reduction of close to 50% at 85 mm NaCl in comparison to control conditions. The double mutant again phenocopied the single mutants, also showing a 50% reduction in LRD. Similar results were obtained when exposing Col-0 and the mutant lines to 115 mm NaCl. These data show that both protein kinases are involved in maintaining root system architecture under saline conditions, where SnRK2.4 exerts its function predominantly in the primary root and SnRK2.10 in the LRs.. . . The reduced number of lateral roots in snrk2.10 and 2.4/2.10 mutants is primarily due to a reduction in the emergence of lateral roots. The reduction in LRD in the single snrk2.10 and snrk2.4/2.10 double mutant could either be due to a reduction in the number of lateral root primordia (LRP) or to a defect in their development. To investigate this in more detail, the developmental stages of all the primordia were studied.. As shown in Figure 3a, no difference in the primary root length was observed for the snrk2.10 mutant compared with the Col-0 wild type under any of the conditions tested. For Col-0, the LRD and the non-emerged LRP density were measured at control conditions, and media supplemented with 85 and 115 mm NaCl (Figure 3b). In control conditions, 65% of the total lateral root primordia (LRP + LR) developed into a LR. When transferred to 85 mm NaCl, there was a 10% decrease in the total number of primordia (LRP + LR), but only 30% of the LRP developed into a LR. At the higher salt concentration (115 mm NaCl), the total number of primordia decreased by 25% compared with control conditions, but the percentage of LRP that developed into a LR was 30%, similar to that observed at 85 mm NaCl (Figure 3b).. . Figure 3. . The snrk2.10 knockout line exhibits a reduction in the number of lateral root primordia (LRP) in saline conditions. Col-0 and snrk2.10 were grown and treated similarly as in Figure 2. (a) Primary root length of Col-0 and snrk2.10 seedlings (n = 19-22). (b) Salt induces an increase in arrested LRP and a reduction in the total number of LRP. The lateral root density (LRD) of Col-0 was measured as in Figure 2. The total number of LRP was counted using a binocular after fixing and clearing the roots. The non-emerged LRP (dark bars), lateral roots (LR; light bars) and the total number of LRP (dark + light bars) were plotted per cm primary root. Asterisks in the dark and light bars represent significant differences in the density of non-emerged LRP and LRs, respectively. Asterisks above the bars indicate significant differences in the density of the total number of LRP. (c) The snrk2.10 knock-out line shows a reduction in LRs and total LRP, but not in the non-emerged LRP. The number of replicates varied between 20 and 30 replicates per line and concentration and seedlings were randomized over different plates. The phenotypes were confirmed in three independent studies. The error bars represent the standard error and significant differences have been determined using a Students t-test (*P < 0.05).. . . . In control conditions, no significant difference in either the LRD or LRP density was detected between Col-0 and snrk2.10 (Figure 3c). At both 85 and 115 mm NaCl, the density of total lateral root primordia (LRP + LR) was less in snrk2.10 than in the wild type. In addition to this reduction, a more pronounced effect was found in the percentage of LRP that developed into a LR (30% in Col-0, to 20% in the snrk2.10 mutant background), which effectively accounted for the overall reduction of over 30% in the emerged LRD (Figure 3c). These results show that the reduction in LRD is partly due to a reduction in the total LRP density, but predominantly caused by a reduction in the percentage of LRP that developed into a LR, showing that SnRK2.10 plays a role in the development of LRP in saline conditions.. . . Tissue-specific localization of SnRK2.4 and 2.10 in Arabidopsis roots. Their high homology at the amino acid sequence level indicated similar functions for the SnRK2.4 and -2.10 protein kinases. However, the knock-out mutants clearly showed different phenotypes in root system architecture in response to salt. To study their expression in roots, YFP-fusions of SnRK2.10 and -2.4 under the control of their native promoter sequence were constructed and transformed into their respective mutant backgrounds.. In the primary root, SnRK2.10-YFP was not detectable in the root tip (Figure 4a) and was predominantly expressed in the vascular tissue in distal root tissue (Figure 4b-d). SnRK2.10-YFP was not detectable in the LRP during the initial stages of development in stages 3 and 6 (classification of LRP as described in Malamy and Benfey, 1997) (Figure 4b,c), but was highly expressed in the adjacent vascular tissue. Further from the root tip, SnRK2.10-YFP expression was higher in cortex cells (Figure 4d). In addition, SnRK2.10-YFP specifically accumulated in the developing vascular tissue of a newly emerged LR (Figure 4d).. . Figure 4. . SnRK2.10 is expressed in the vascular tissue at the site of a lateral root. (a-d) pSnRK2.10::SnRK2.10-YFP was stably transformed into the snrk2.10-2 mutant background. The mid-section of the primary root (a), lateral root primordia (LRP) in stage 3 (b), 6 (c) and emerged (d) were imaged. SnRK2.10-YFP is primarily expressed in the vascular tissue distal from the root tip. The arrow indicates the accumulation of SnRK2.10-YFP in the developing vascular tissue of an emerged lateral root. Prior to imaging, plants were exposed to propidium iodide for 2 min. Plants were grown vertically under an angle of 70 on agar plates containing  MS and 1% sugar for 7 days. SnRK2.10-YFP is shown in green and propidium iodide is shown in red. Wide-field images are depicted with their corresponding confocal images and all the pictures were taken with the same confocal settings.. . . . SnRK2.4-YFP was expressed in almost all cells proximal to the root tip of the primary root, excluding the columella cells. The highest accumulation of SnRK2.4-YFP was in pericycle cells (Figure 5a, lower arrow). Further distal from the root tip, SnRK2.4-YFP also accumulated in the endodermis (upper arrow), while its abundance in the adjacent cortex cells was reduced. Even further distal from the root tip, the expression in the epidermal cells was low (Figure 5b-d). Interestingly, at the site of a developing LRP (stage 3), SnRK2.4-YFP accumulated in punctate structures in the LRP (Figure 5b). At a later stage of LRP development (stage 6), SnRK2.4-YFP was present in the cytosol of all the LRP cells (Figure 5c). Remarkably, enhanced expression was observed in the cortex cells at the side of the developing LRP, which was not observed in the cortex cells on the other side. In addition, accumulation of SnRK2.4-YFP was observed in punctate structures in these cells (Figure 5c, indicated by the arrow). In the emerged LR, SnRK2.4-YFP was expressed at low levels in the developing vascular tissue, similar to the expression pattern of SnRK2.10-YFP (Figure 5d).. . Figure 5. . SnRK2.4 is expressed in cells surrounding an emerging lateral root primordium (LRP), and accumulates in punctate structures in these cells.(a-d) pSnRK2.4::SnRK2.4-YFP was stably transformed into the snrk2.4-1 mutant. The mid-section of the primary root (a), LRP in stage 3 (b), stage 6 (c) and emerged (d) were imaged. (a) SnRK2.4-YFP accumulated in pericycle (indicated by the lower arrow), and the endodermis (indicated by the upper arrow). (b) At the site of a stage 3 LRP, SnRK2.4-YFP was highly expressed and accumulated in punctate structures. The expression in epidermal cells was lower compared than in the root tip. (c) Cortex cells surrounding the LRP contained higher levels SnRK2.4-YFP and similar punctate structures as observed in a stage 3 LRP (indicated by the arrow). (d) Accumulation in the developing vascular tissue of an emerged lateral root. SnRK2.4-YFP is shown in green and propidium iodide is shown in red. The growth conditions were the same and all the pictures were taken with the same confocal settings as used in Figure 4.. . . . . . Relocalization of SnRK2.4-YFP upon salt stress. To investigate whether localization of SnRK2.4 or -2.10 would change in response to salt treatment, seedlings were treated with 115 mm NaCl. SnRK2.4-YFP relocalized from the cytosol to punctate structures within 5 min of salt application in epidermal cells (Figure 6, Video S1). Two minutes after the start of the treatment (first frame), SnRK2.4-YFP was still predominantly cytosolic, but after 15 min most of the SnRK2.4-YFP had moved from the cytosol and accumulated at unknown punctate structures. To confirm that the fusion protein was functional, western analysis and an in-gel kinase assay were performed on the SnRK2.4-YFP-expressing line, which showed that the fusion protein was intact and could be activated by salt treatment, similar to the endogenous SnRK2.4 protein kinase (Figure S3a,b). Moreover, an N-terminal GFP fusion of the SnRK2.4 protein could also be activated by salt (Figure S3a,b), and this fusion also relocalized to punctate structures upon salt treatment (Figure S3c), similar to SnRK2.4-YFP, ruling out any positional effect of the fluorescent protein tag on localization of the protein. SnRK2.10-YFP localization did not seem to be affected by salt treatment (up to 30 min).. . Figure 6. . SnRK2.4-YFP accumulates in punctate structures in root epidermal cells upon salt stress. Seven-day-old snrk2.4-1 pSnRK2.4::SnRK2.4-YFP seedlings were stained with propidium iodide for 2 min and subsequently placed either in control medium or medium containing 115 mm NaCl. The first image was taken 2 min after the saline medium was applied. Images were taken in epidermal cells approximately 150 mum above the root tip. In the lower right corner the same area is shown after 10 min of control treatment. SnRK2.4-YFP is shown in green and propidium iodide is shown in red. The growth conditions were the same and all the pictures were taken with the same confocal settings as used in Figure 4.. . . . A co-localization study with FM4-64, a lipophilic dye to label membranes, was performed to further investigate the nature of the accumulation of SnRK2.4-YFP (Figure S4). After treatment with the dye for 2 h prior to the 15-min salt stress treatment, co-localization occurred in some of the punctate structures that were closer to the membrane (indicated by the arrows), indicating that SnRK2.4-YFP is targeted to cellular membranes.. . . Biochemical fractionation reveals membrane association of SnRK2.4 and/or SnRK2.10 upon salt stress. In order to further confirm the salt-induced recruitment to membranes, endogenous SnRK2.4/SnRK2.10 levels were analysed after subcellular fractionation in control and salt-stressed roots. This approach consisted of a number of different centrifugation steps, allowing the isolation of proteins that are associated with the membrane. A similar approach conducted on Sorghum bicolour was described earlier (Monreal et al., 2010).. Different fractions were analysed by using antibodies against proteins that reside in different cellular compartments (Figure 7a). Protein concentrations of all fractions were normalized in order to determine relative alterations between fractions. The total, 50 000 g supernatant and the Brij-58 wash fraction mainly consisted of cytosolic proteins in both control and salt-stimulated samples. SnRK2.4/2.10 were highly abundant in these fractions, confirming their cytosolic localization. Both the 10 000 g (debris, intact organelles) and 50 000 g (microsomal membranes) pellet fractions contained cytosolic contamination, but contained mainly trans-membrane and peripheral membrane proteins. In comparison to the cytosolic marker, SnRK2.4/2.10 was enriched in these fractions indicating they were partially membrane bound in both control and saline conditions. When the cytosolic contaminants were removed by Brij-58 washing (Hardin et al., 2004; Johansson et al., 1995), a striking increase of SnRK2.4/2.10 was observed in the remaining pellet fraction of the salt-treated samples, but not in the control samples. The peripheral membrane marker, V-ATPase epsilon subunit, was equally present in this fraction in both samples, indicating that the same protein pools were isolated. The localization of SnRK2.4/2.10, in these fractionation studies indicated not only cytosolic but also membrane-associated localization in saline conditions, confirming the confocal microscopy observations and showing that SnRK2.4 is recruited to the membrane upon salt stress.. . Figure 7. . SnRK2.4/2.10 are targeted to cellular membranes during salt stress and bind phosphatidic acid (PA) in vitro. (a) Proteins from control or 150 mm NaCl-treated Arabidopsis roots were isolated and fractionated using sequential centrifugation steps. Pellet fractions are indicated with P and the supernatant fractions are indicated with S. Western blot analysis was performed on these fractions using antibodies against different compartment markers or SnRK2.4/2.10. Membranes (50 000 g pellet) were isolated and washed with Brij-58 to remove any cytosolic contaminants. From the upper to lower panel: plasma membrane (PM ATPase), peripheral vacuolar membrane (PMP V-ATPase epsilon subunit), SnRK2.4/2.10 and the cytosolic marker fructose-1,6-biphosphate (Cyt. cFBPase). In the lowest panel a silver stain is shown as a loading control. (b) Both SnRK2.4 and -2.10 bind liposomes containing PA. Purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant protein (1 mug per sample) was mixed with liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC/phosphatidylserine (PS) (1:1) or PC/PA (1:1). Lipid concentrations available for binding were 2 mm for PS and 2, 0.5 or 0.1 mm for PA. The start fraction represents the input, the pellet fraction represents the fraction that bound to the liposomes and the supernatant represents the remainder. Relative loading: start 50%, pellet 100%, supernatant 50%.. . . . . . Recombinant SnRK2.10 and SnRK2.4 both specifically interact with phosphatidic acid in vitro. Salinity stress is known to induce changes in the phospholipid composition of membranes in Arabidopsis, including the transient formation of PA (Bargmann et al., 2009). SnRK2.10 was identified in a proteomic screen for PA targets and was shown to bind PA affinity beads (Testerink et al., 2004). To test whether SnRK2.10 and its most related family member, SnRK2.4, directly bind to PA and to assess the specificity of lipid binding, recombinant GST-SnRK2.10 and GST-SnRK2.4 proteins purified from Escherichia coli were tested in a liposome binding assay (Figure 7b). Since liposomes consist of a lipid bilayer, interaction with a more naturally organized PA can be shown using this approach (Julkowska et al., 2012; Testerink et al., 2007). Both SnRK2.4 and -2.10 exhibited binding affinity for PA-containing liposomes in a concentration-dependent manner, while no binding could be detected for liposomes containing another anionic phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS), or control lipids consisting only of the structural phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Figure 7b). Thus, SnRK2.10 and SnRK2.4 are able to bind PA directly and selectively in vitro, providing a possible molecular basis for the observed interaction of SnRK2.4 with cellular membranes upon exposure of roots to salt..
PMC3206852	Results. Promoter-GUS transcriptional fusion assays showed that expression of VvMYB60 was restricted to stomatal guard cells and was attenuated in response to ABA. Unlike VvMYB30, VvMYB60 was able to complement the loss-of-function atmyb60-1 mutant, indicating that VvMYB60 is the only true ortholog of AtMYB60 in the grape genome. In addition, VvMYB60 was differentially regulated during development of grape organs and in response to ABA and drought-related stress conditions..
PMC3871820	Results. . Data integration for identifying potential functionally redundant TCP pairs. This work started with the hypothesis that comparing the behaviour of members of a gene family in various datasets, and identifying those that behave in the most similar way based on this information, would yield a list of gene combinations that are likely to share common molecular and biological functions. Because whole-genome and chromosomal segment duplications are an important source for additional copies of genes in plant genomes (Flagel and Wendel, 2009), the prediction focused on pairs of TCP genes. For this purpose, information on DNA and protein sequences and expression patterns can be obtained from publicly available resources. However, further in-depth bioinformatics analysis using comprehensive datasets may increase the predictive power of the data integration. Therefore, a data analysis pipeline was built, in which phylogenetic relationships, gene expression patterns, and information about protein-protein interaction capacity are integrated. Initially, a phylogenetic tree was built based on publicly available protein sequence data for all 24 Arabidopsis TCP transcription factors. Similar to previously described phylogenetic trees (Cubas et al., 1999; Aguilar-Martinez et al., 2007), the resulting phylogenetic tree divides the TCP family into two distinct classes, the class I and class II TCP proteins (Fig. 1A). In a next step, differences in TCP expression during Arabidopsis development were analysed based on publicly available microarray data from AtGenExpress (Schmid et al., 2005). Some of the TCP genes did not show significant expression for any of the analysed tissues: these were TCP1, TCP6, TCP7, TCP12/BRC2, TCP16, TCP18/BRC1, and TCP22 (Supplementary Table S1). As this work were specifically interested in functional redundancies of TCP genes in leaf development, the AtGenExpress data were extended by analysing expression of all 24 TCP genes by qRT-PCR in a leaf developmental series. In this experiment, all aboveground parts of wild-type Arabidopis Col-0 seedlings were harvested at days 4 and 7 after germination, and the first rosette leaf was harvested at days 11, 14, 16, 21, and 28 after germination. Per time point, three biological replicates consisting of 30 plants were harvested. Also here, for some TCPs no expression was detected (TCP1, TCP6, TCP11, TCP12/BRC2, TCP15, TCP18/BRC1), indicating that these are not or only very weakly expressed in leaves (Fig. 2). Subsequently, expression-based distances between pairs of TCP genes were calculated for the AtGenExpress dataset and the newly generated expression data (Fig. 1B and C). The calculated distances were correlated between the two expression datasets; however, as expected the distance scores do not overlap perfectly (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, the two expression-based scores were integrated separately into the bioinformatics analysis for the prediction of TCP transcription factor pairs that share functions in leaf development.. . Fig. 1.. . Relationships between TCP transcription factors. Relationship is based on (A) protein sequence, (B) AtGenExpress data, and (C) quantitative real-time PCR data on leaf development. The phylogenetic tree for TCP protein sequences was generated using PhyML. Trees representing expression data were generated by first converting expression patterns to distances between pairs of genes and then applying the neighbour-joining algorithm. Expression data for (B) were from the AtGenExpress microarray expression compendium by Schmid et al. 2005; expression data for (C) are from this study. class I TCPs are marked in grey.. . . . . Fig. 2.. . Expression analysis of all 24 Arabidopsis TCP transcription factor genes during leaf development. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on seedlings harvested at days 4 and 7 after germination and on the first rosette leaf harvested at days 11, 14, 16, 21, and 28 after germination. Analysis was done in triplicate and bars indicate SE. X-axis, time in days; Y-axis, normalized expression.. . . . Some TCP gene pairs show a high expression correlation, but they would not have been denominated as closest related TCP genes based on similarity of the encoded protein sequences. For example, TCP14 and TCP21 are class I TCP proteins that do not cluster in the same subclade based on protein sequence comparison (Fig. 1A), but were found to be highly co-expressed in a variety of tissues (Fig. 1B) and during leaf development (Fig. 1C) and thus potential candidates for functional redundancy based on similar gene expression patterns. Although, functional analyses are still needed to proof redundancy in this particular case, it is an example of two TCPs that would not have been considered based on protein sequence similarity solely.. . . A matrix-based Y2H analysis shows class preference in TCP-TCP interactions. TCP transcription factors are known to form dimers (Kosugi and Ohashi, 2002) and to interact with other type of proteins (Pruneda-Paz et al., 2009; Giraud et al., 2010). The current work investigated protein-protein interaction capabilities for all 24 Arabidopsis TCP transcription factors in a matrix-based Y2H analysis to obtain additional functional data for TCP transcription factors that can be implemented to improve the prediction of functional redundancy. The assay resulted in 64 detected dimer combinations: seven homodimers and 57 heterodimers (Fig. 3).. . Fig. 3.. . Results of the matrix-based yeast two-hybrid analysis of TCP-TCP protein-protein interactions. Cytoscape version 2.6.2 (Shannon et al., 2003) was used to visualize protein-protein interactions. Nodes represent the TCPs, edges represent the protein-protein interaction between these. White nodes are class II TCPs, black nodes are class I TCPs. As the graphical layout is spring embedded, groups of nodes are placed closer to each other equivalent to the number of edges between them. The representation reveals that TCPs prefer protein-protein interactions within their own class.. . . . Class I TCP transcription factors prefer to interact with other class I TCP proteins, and the same holds for class II TCP proteins. Based on phylogeny, class II TCP proteins grouped into three subclades, of which members from the CYCLOIDEA/TEOSINTE BRANCHED-like subclade (TCP1, TCP12, and TCP18) did not show any interaction in the Y2H analysis. A recent study in Gerbera suggests that these TCP proteins homodimerize and interact specifically with each other (Thtiharju et al., 2012). However, due to auto-activation of the reporters, the homodimerization capacity for the Arabidopsis CYCLOIDEA/TEOSINTE BRANCHED-like proteins could not be accessed. The other two subclades of the class II TCP proteins consist of CINCINNATA-like TCP transcription factors, and they differ in the fact that the genes belonging to one subclade are targeted by miRNA319 (TCP2, TCP3, TCP4, TCP10, TCP24, the so-called jaw-TCP genes), and members from the other are not (TCP5, TCP13, TCP17, hereafter called TCP5-like TCP genes). Interestingly, jaw-TCP proteins preferably form dimers with TCP5-like proteins, and vice versa. This phenomenon of preferred dimerization between members from different subclades was not detected for the class I TCP transcription factors. Remarkably, the number of potential dimerization partners per protein was higher for class I TCP proteins (average of 7.3 interaction partners in comparison to class II TCPs with an average of 2.5). It is not known whether this is of functional relevance or whether it is due to the fact that class II TCPs, in contrast to class I TCPs, exhibit more often autoactivation capacity in yeast and, hence, could not be tested for all possible combinations.. . . Integrative analysis of TCP transcription factors leads to several functional redundancy predictions. In a next step, pairs of TCP proteins with a high potential for functional redundancy were determined by ranking the distances in protein sequence, gene expression, and protein-protein interaction patterns of all TCP pairs and cumulating the ranks. Due to the slight differences between the two gene expression datasets, and because integrating both expression datasets would need a correction for a bias towards expression data at the expense of sequence homology and protein-protein interaction data, the two datasets were used independently and obtained two different rankings. TCP6 and TCP16, which could not be detected in either of the expression datasets, were excluded from further analysis because no score could be calculated. Nevertheless, similar functions have been reported for TCP11 and TCP16 (Takeda et al., 2006; Viola et al., 2011). Likewise, TCP proteins that exhibited no interaction in the Y2H assay were also excluded from the analysis: these were TCP1, TCP12, and TCP18. The full information on calculated redundancy scores is given in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. Before analysing specific TCP pairs, the robustness of the ranking was tested by applying bootstrapping on the different datasets, recalculating the different ranks, and obtaining the rank sum after combining the different information sources. This bootstrapping analysis indicated that the ranking was indeed robust: compared to the rank sum obtained using the original dataset, the average Spearman rank correlation obtained was 0.980.02 (range 0.89-1.0). The 10 TCP pairs with the best scores (i.e. the ones with the lowest rank sum using the integrated datasets) are listed for the two independent integrative analyses in Table 1. Although there is a high correlation between the two analyses when comparing all rankings (Spearmans rank correlation 0.94, P < 10-15), the top 10 tables for functionally redundant TCP pairs show some differences. This may be due to the strong cut off applied when only counting the best 10 out of 136 and 120 analysed TCP pairs, respectively. Also, one of the pairs obtained by the analysis using the microarray data involves TCP11, for which no expression of the encoding gene could be detected in leaves by qRT-PCR. Hence, this pair could obviously not be predicted by the analysis based on qRT-PCR data. Some TCP pairs appear in both tables: TCP19-TCP20, TCP13-TCP17, TCP4-TCP10, TCP2-TCP24, and TCP3-TCP4. A large number of these combinations were described to be functionally redundant in previous studies (Palatnik et al., 2003; Efroni et al., 2008), showing that the approach was solid and identified the majority of known cases. Interestingly, this approach also predicted various novel combinations, as exemplified by one of the top hits, TCP19-TCP20. This result suggests that, although sequence similarity is a strong predictor of functional redundancy, available information about expression or protein behaviour can be additive and useful.. .

One of the best-studied and described members of the Arabidopsis TCP family is TCP4 and its influence on leaf development. It is known that TCP4 and its four homologues are knocked down in the jaw-D genotype and that overexpression of a microRNA resistant TCP4 leads to severe developmental defects (Palatnik et al., 2003). Based on integrated analyses, TCP10 should behave similarly upon overexpression. Hence, a Jaw-microRNA-insensitive TCP10 gene (TCP10m) was introduced into a constitutive expression vector and tagged with a GR domain to allow induction of TCP10m at different time points during development (Aoyama and Chua, 1997). The TCP10 mutation was introduced in the same way as described previously for TCP4 (Palatnik et al., 2003) and did not result in changes in the translated protein sequence. This pCaMV35S::TCP10m-GR vector was transformed into jaw-D plants to prevent endogenous TCP10 and other jaw-TCPs from competing with the introduced protein, and to test for (over-)complementation of the jaw-D phenotype by TCP10m. Continuous release of TCP10 protein into the cell nucleus by DEX treatment resulted in arrest of the SAM early during vegetative growth (Fig. 4), with the formation of only a few or no leaf primordia, phenocopying the effect of TCP4m (Fig. 4A-C). When the treatment was started 6 days after germination, the plants showed intermediate phenotypes: more leaves were formed, but they were smaller and non-serrated and further leaf initiation was arrested shortly after DEX induction (Fig. 4D-G). None of these observed phenotypes was seen in DEX-treated control plants (Fig. 4J and K) or untreated jaw-D/TCP10m-GR and control plants (Fig. 4H, I, and L). These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that TCP4 and TCP10 share similar functions. To investigate how the effect of TCP10 on the apical meristem can be explained at the molecular level, this work determined potential direct target genes of TCP10m-GR by combining a DEX-induction assay with a microarray analysis. The resulting list of 89 genes that are differentially regulated between jaw-D/TCP10m-GR versus jaw-D treated with DEX is given in Supplementary Table S4. Surprisingly, this work did not identify in the potential TCP10m-GR target gene list any common genes or those that are known to be affected by TCP4 (Schommer et al., 2008). However, in the previously performed experiments for TCP4, the focus was not on the detection of direct target genes, and steady-state expression differences between wild-type and TCP4 overexpression lines were identified. Hence, overlap for particular affected biological processes only could be expected and so, considering this, the microarray data were analysed for overrepresentation of biological processes using BiNGO (Maere et al., 2005) (Supplementary Table S5). Out of the genes that were included in this analysis, 12.6% were found to be involved in the response to auxin, whereas genome wide only 1% falls into this class. Although, after multiple-testing correction, the associated P-value is not significant, for the more general term response to stimulus the overrepresentation is significant. The eight auxin response genes are listed in Table 2. Among them were five SAUR-like (SMALL AUXIN UP RNA-like) auxin-responsive protein family genes and TCP4 appeared to regulate expression of SAUR-like genes as well (Sarvepalli and Nath, 2011). Consequently, it can be assumed that auxin signalling is important for jaw-TCP functions in the SAM and is affected by both TCP4 and TCP10. The list of potential direct target genes was examined more closely and the KNAT3 gene, encoding for a member of the class II knotted1-like homeobox gene family, was among the upregulated genes upon TCP10m-GR activation (Supplementary Table S4). This was particularly interesting as other KNAT genes have previously been shown to interact with jaw-TCPs in early leaf development (Li et al., 2012).. . Table 2.. .

Functional complementation of the jaw-D phenotype by dexamethason (DEX) induction of TCP10m-GR. All material was grown for 3 weeks on half-strength MS medium with or without DEX treatment prior to phenotypic analyses. (A-C) Continuous induction of jaw-D/TCP10m-GR seedling by DEX leads to overcompensation; note that no new leaf primordia are formed. (D-G) When induced 6 days after germination and subsequently kept for the following 15 days on DEX, the first leaves of jaw-D/TCP10m-GR plants appeared normal, but plants remained small and eventually died. However, in these plants, various true leaf primordia were formed (G). (H) A representative 3-week-old untreated jaw-D/TCP10m-GR plant. (I) An untreated jaw-D control plant.

Validation of redundancy predictions by a genetic approach. Ultimate proof for overlap in functions can be obtained by comparing single and double knockouts for particular combinations of TCP genes. Therefore, the bioinformatics analyses were further validated by crossing single T-DNA insertion lines for selected class I TCP pairs, followed by phenotypic analyses for the obtained single and double mutants. For this purpose, the pair TCP20 and TCP8 and the combination TCP20 and TCP19 were chosen. Whereas the pair TCP19-TCP20 ranked in the top 10 of both analyses for potential functional overlaps, the TCP8-TCP20 pair was not, despite TCP8 being as closely related to TCP20 in protein sequence as TCP19 (Fig. 1A). Recently, functions in determining leaf pavement cell sizes and in controlling the onset of senescence could be assigned to TCP20 (Danisman et al., 2012). Therefore, a detailed senescence assay was performed to study possible overlap in functions for the indicated type I TCP gene pairs (Fig. 5A). As expected based on the bioinformatics predictions, the tcp8tcp20 double mutant did not exhibit any accelerated senescence when subjected to the assay. Instead, the tcp19tcp20 double mutant showed a greatly enhanced senescence phenotype, thus confirming that TCP19, but apparently not TCP8, shares function with TCP20 in the leaf senescence response (Fig. 5B). The senescence assay was analysed using a chi-squared test and the observed differences in the senescence frequencies of tcp19tcp20 double mutants in comparison to wild type and the single mutants proved to be statistically significant with a P-value < 0.01. This confirms the hypothesis that using protein sequence information alone can be too limited for the identification of potential functionally redundant protein pairs and that a relatively simple bioinformatics analysis of available and easily obtainable data can increase the chance to detect functionally redundant proteins.. .

PMC4944173	Results. . DPMP elicits CaBP22. . -333. . ::GUS expression. Synthetic elicitors identified by our high throughput screen can be categorized into several structural classes. One structural class, phenyl-imino-methyl-phenol derivatives (PMPs) and related compounds, are represented by more than 30 members in our original set of 114 synthetic elicitor candidates. PMPs share a phenyl-imino-methyl-phenol skeleton. The PMP, 2,4-dichloro-6-{(E)-[(3-methoxyphenyl)imino]methyl}phenol (DPMP) particularly strongly induced CaBP22-333::GUS expression. One week-old liquid-grown Arabidopsis CaBP22-333::GUS seedlings continuously exposed to DPMP at a concentration as low as 1muM for 24h exhibited GUS reporter gene expression (see Supplementary Fig. S1a). We further tested for possible synthetic elicitor-induced phytotoxicity by trypan blue staining of CaBP22-333::GUS seedlings 24h after incubation with various concentrations of DPMP (see Supplementary Fig. S1b). The results shown in Supplementary Fig. S1a and b can be compared, as the same types of treatment were performed. Seedlings treated with a concentration of 500muM DPMP stained dark blue, indicating extensive cell death. While some cell death may occur at intermediate concentrations (50muM and 100muM), no cell death was observed at lower concentrations (1muM, 3muM and 10muM), which induce CaBP22-333::GUS expression. Thus, DPMP-mediated phytotoxicity is not responsible for expression of this defense-associated reporter gene, but it may be the cause of the observed decline of GUS activity at higher concentrations.. . . DPMP induces rapidly and transiently disease resistance of Arabidopsis against Hpa. We further examined whether DPMP induces disease resistance against the pathogenic oomycete Hpa in soil-grown plants. Wild type seedlings of the Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0) were pretreated with different concentrations of DPMP once by a single foliar spray application 24h prior to infection with the virulent Hpa isolate Noco2 (HpaNoco2). Hpa spores were counted 7 days post infection (dpi). Plants sprayed with concentrations as low as 1muM of DPMP showed a significant reduction in spore production compared to mock-pretreated plants (Fig. 1) and at 10muM DPMP, this effect reached its maximal level of HpaNoco2 immunity. Compared to our previously characterized synthetic elicitors DCA and BHTC3031, DPMP displayed maximal suppression of spore formation at 10 times lower concentrations.. Based on the dose-response data shown in Fig. 1, we estimated the median effective concentration (EC50) of DPMP regarding its ability to protect Arabidopsis from HpaNoco2 as 514nM (see Supplementary Fig. S2). This value is much lower than those estimated for DCA and BHTC, which are 6.5muM and 5.5muM, respectively3031. Although these EC50 values are only estimations based on extrapolations of a small number of measurements, it is clear from our data that the EC50 values for Hpa protection assays of DCA and BHTC are substantially above 1muM, while that of DPMP is below 1muM. These results suggest that DPMP is particularly potent in mediating protection of Arabidopsis against Hpa infections. This may be due to efficiency regarding its uptake and/or ability to interact with its targets, but may also have different reasons, as we cannot rule out toxicity of DPMP against Hpa.. We further analyzed the kinetics of DPMP-induced defense induction and compared it with the kinetic behavior of other synthetic elicitors. Col-0 plants were pretreated with 100muM of BHTC, DCA or INA or 10muM of DPMP at various time points ranging from 1hour to 6 days prior to pathogen challenge (Fig. 2). At these concentrations each of the tested compounds exhibits maximal activity. Mock treatment itself reduced spore growth when time points between HpaNoco2 infection and chemical treatment were less than one day apart. This effect is likely due to residual liquid coating of plants before being treated with pathogen. At 1-hour post treatment (hpt), all of the tested chemicals reduced Hpa spore production (Fig. 2). At 1-day post treatment (dpt), 10muM DPMP exhibited a similar strength of defense induction as 100muM DCA or 100muM INA. Of all of four tested treatments, BHTC showed the weakest activity in inducing disease resistance.. Between 3 and 6 dpt, levels of DPMP-mediated immunity began to decline while. INA-mediated immunity remained constant. At 6 dpt, DPMP did not trigger any significant immunity against the pathogen. Consistent with previous reports, DCA and BHTC also induced plant immunity transiently3031, while the activity of INA is long-lasting273221. Taken together, our results clearly showed that the defense-inducing activity of DPMP against HpaNoco2 is stronger than that of other synthetic elicitors we characterized before. Furthermore, its activity is rapid and transient, like that of DCA and BHTC.. . . DPMP provides disease protection against the bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. We further tested the ability of DPMP to induce resistance against the virulent bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato strain DC3000 (Pst). Arabidopsis plants were pretreated with synthetic elicitors at concentrations at which they trigger strong immunity against Hpa 24h prior to dip-inoculation with Pst. As with INA and DCA, DPMP-pretreated plants showed a significant reduction in bacterial growth (Fig. 3a). To test for a potential direct toxic activity of DPMP against bacteria, we grew Pst in liquid medium containing DPMP, other synthetic elicitors or the antibiotic hygromycin. None of the tested synthetic elicitors reduced bacterial growth, while hygromycin completely eliminated growth of Pst (Fig. 3b). DPMP is also effective in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) against Pst at a dose at which it is non-toxic for these bacteria. We repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 3b with a DPMP concentration of 50muM and did not observe toxicity against Pst (data not shown). For our tomato/Pst assays, we tested both foliar-spray and root-drench application and found the latter to be more efficient. Tomato plants root drenched with 50muM DPMP displayed a significant reduction in Pst growth in leaves three days post infection relative to plants treated with a mock solution (Fig. 3c). In previous experiments31, 200muM of BHTC were needed for similar results in tomato against Pst, confirming that DPMP is a more potent synthetic elicitor than BHTC. Taken together, DPMP can induce plant immunity against Pst without being directly toxic to this pathogen.. . . DPMP interacts with targets operating downstream or independently from SA biosynthesis and is fully dependent on NPR1. To determine the mode of action of this new synthetic elicitor, we analyzed the defense-inducing activity of DPMP in the ndr1-1, pad4-1, sid2-2, npr1-3 and wrky70-3 Arabidopsis defense mutants as well as the transgenic nahG line. While the ndr1, sid2 and pad4 mutant plants are known to be compromised in defense-associated SA biosynthesis and the transgenic nahG line does not accumulate significant levels of this defense hormone14, npr1 mutants are deficient in the perception of SA33343536. WRKY70 is a transcription factor that partially operates in defense signaling downstream from NPR1 and is partially NPR1-independent30373839. Col-0 and mutants plants were treated with HpaNoco2 24h after single foliar-spray applications with 10muM DPMP. Hpa spores were counted 7 dpi. DPMP induced strong resistance against Hpa in Col-0 wild type plants and the sid2-2, pad4-1 and ndr1 mutants (Fig. 4a). DPMP-mediated immunity was slightly, but significantly reduced in the wrky70 mutant compared to Col-0 (Fig. 4b). However, in npr1-3 plants the defense inducing activity of DPMP was fully abolished; similar to that of INA (Fig. 4c). Our lab previously reported that DCA is partially dependent on NPR1 and WRKY7030. DPMP is weakly dependent on WRKY70 and completely dependent on NPR1, which discriminates this compound from DCA. Surprisingly, in nahG transgenic plants, no significant protection was observed against Hpa after the application of DPMP (Fig. 4a). The nahG transgenic plants express a SA hydroxylase, an enzyme that converts SA to catechol. It is possible that this enzyme is also converting DPMP or one of its bioactive metabolic products.. . . Structure activity analysis of a selection of PMP-related derivatives. DPMP is only one member of a set of 33 PMPs or -related compounds identified by our high throughput synthetic elicitor screen. While not all of these 33 compounds share a common phenyl-imino-methyl-phenol skeleton, they all bear an imine group linked to a phenyl moiety. We tested ten compounds of this set of 33 that were commercially available and compared their defense-inducing activities to DPMP (Fig. 5a,b). Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were pretreated with a concentration of 10muM or 25muM of the respective chemicals 24h prior to HpaNoco2 infection. We observed three major activity trends of these compounds: strong, moderate or weak compared to DPMP, which we considered a strong defense inducer. PMP-related compounds that induced significant levels of immunity against Hpa at 10muM and 25muM were categorized as strong. If they only induced significant protection against Hpa at 25muM, we categorized them as moderate. If they did not exhibit any significant defense induction at the tested concentrations, we classified them as weak inducers, as they were still able to induce CaBP22-333::GUS expression in our initial compound screen (data not shown).. 4-[[(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)methylene]amino] benzenesulfonamide (CMP974) and 4-tert-butyl-2-[(5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino]phenol (CMP993), provided strong protection against Hpa infection. CMP974 and CMP993 suppressed Hpa spore growth at concentrations of both 10muM and 25muM and levels of protection mediated by them reached up to 80% and 50%, respectively.. Benzoic acid, 3-fluoro-2-[(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)methylene]hydrazide (CMP508), N-benzylidene-2-hydroxybenzohydrazide (CMP318), Benzenamine, N-[(5-bromo-2-thienyl)methylene]-2-methyl-3-nitro-[N(E)]- (CMP686) mediated moderate levels of defense induction and reduced susceptibility only at the 25muM concentration to 75% to 50%. Although the five remaining PMP-related compounds did not trigger defense induction at concentrations of 10muM or 25muM, and are considered weak inducers, they may induce plant defense at higher concentrations. The strongest compounds of the 10 tested candidates are true PMPs structurally similar to DPMP, while the class of moderate defense inducers also includes CMP318 and CMP686, compounds that deviate from the PMP core structure.. . . Synthetic elicitor activity of possible metabolic products of DPMP. The imine bond of PMPs may be subject to hydrolysis in the aqueous environment of biological tissues and cells40. Members of the imine bond containing compound class imprimatin C1 are known to remain stable in aqueous solution before application to plants and the synthetic auxin sirtinol, which also contains an imine bond, is hydrolyzed after uptake into cells4142.. We tested whether the molecular structure of DPMP dissociates in aqueous solution in vitro. NMR analysis combined with HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) showed that DPMP is not hydrolyzed in aqueous medium in vitro (data not shown). However, upon uptake by plant tissues, DPMP may get hydrolyzed and further converted by plant enzymes and the resulting products may be the actual biologically active compounds in vivo.. Therefore we tested 3,5-dichlorosalicylaldehyde (3,5-DCSAL) and m-anisidine (Fig. 6f). While m-anisidine should get released upon hydrolysis of DPMP, the production of 3,5-DCSAL should require an additional oxidation step. We first tested the ability of 3,5-DCSAL and m-anisidine to induce GUS expression in transgenic CaBP22-333::GUS Arabidopsis plants (Fig. 6a). 3,5-DCSAL induced expression of this pathogen-responsive reporter gene at the same concentration as DPMP (1-10muM). At higher concentrations of 3,5-DCSAL (50muM to 500muM), the observed decline of GUS activity may be cause by 3,5-DCSAL -mediated phytotoxicity.. Surprisingly, m-anisidine also induced GUS expression in this plant line, albeit at much higher concentrations (50-500muM). To confirm these results, we tested different concentrations of 3,5-DCSAL and m-anisidine in Hpa defense assays and compared their bioactivity to DPMP. At a concentration of 10muM, 3,5-DCSAL exhibits a similar strength of defense activation as 10muM DPMP against Hpa (Fig. 6b). M-anisidine does not trigger defense induction at a concentration of 100muM (data not shown). However, at higher concentrations (400muM and 600muM) m-anisidine triggers immunity against Hpa and, like DPMP, its defense-inducing activity is completely dependent on NPR1 (Fig. 6c). Much lower concentrations of m-anisidine were sufficient for the CaBP22-333::GUS expression studies shown in Fig. 6a than that for the Hpa defense assays shown in Fig. 6c. This difference is due to the nature of the respective assays. While the reporter gene assays were done under continuous exposure to the compound for 24 h, the synthetic elicitors were only applied once by single spray application in the Hpa assays. In addition to protection against Hpa, m-anisidine induced plant immunity against Pst (Fig. 6d). In order to test whether the imine bridge of PMPs itself is sufficient to induce immunity against HpaNoco2, we analyzed N-[(E)-2-Thienylmethylidene]-2-Propanamine (CMP500) (Fig. 6f), a molecule of relative simple structure that contains an imine bridge. CMP500 did not induce detectable resistance of Arabidopsis Col-0 against HpaNoco2 at the concentration we tested (Fig. 6e). Taken together these results show that, the PMP imine bridge structure itself seems not to trigger immunity. However, two possible metabolic products of DPMP have synthetic elicitor activity. As 3,5-DCSAL is of similar efficiency as DPMP, this potential metabolic product of DPMP may be mainly responsible for the observed immunity after DPMP application. Although we cannot exclude, that in plant tissues 3,5-DCSAL gets further oxidized to 3,5 Dichlorosalicylic acid, this aldehyde proved to be a powerful synthetic elicitor.. . . Transcriptome changes triggered by DPMP in Arabidopsis shoots and roots. To profile global transcriptional patterns associated with DPMP-mediated defense activation in Arabidopsis roots and shoots separately, we performed mRNA-seq analysis. In soil grown plants, separating these plant parts from each other without any contamination by dirt or excessive wounding is difficult. Therefore Arabidopsis plants were grown for 14 days on  MS agar plates containing either 3muM DPMP or mock solution (solvent only) and their shoot and root tissues were analyzed separately. This condition was chosen because continuous exposure to 3muM DPMP triggers strong GUS expression in CaBP22-333::GUS plants (see Supplementary Fig. S1). We performed two independent biological replicates and sequenced the respective libraries using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after DPMP treatment were identified by comparing read counts to those observed in the respective mock-treated control samples using a Bonferroni-corrected false discovery rate (FDR)-cut off of 0.05.. In shoots, treatment with DPMP significantly altered transcript levels of 1364 genes, 1061 of which were transcriptionally up-regulated (DPMP-shoots-up) and 303 were transcriptionally down-regulated (DPMP-shoots-down) relative to the mock controls (see Supplementary Table S1). DPMP treatment in shoot tissue resulted in a typical defense-associated transcriptional profile. Standard defense marker genes, such as PR1, PR5, CaBP22 and LURP1, as well as numerous WRKY transcription factor genes were transcriptionally up-regulated. Enriched gene ontology (GO) terms were calculated by the Botany Array Resource classification super viewer [ http://bar.utoronto.ca/welcome.htm;43] and suggested that collective roles of DPMP-shoots-up genes are in response to stress and abiotic/biotic stimuli as well as signal transduction (Table 1). Furthermore, the analysis of promoter motifs of these genes using the TAIR motif analysis tool (https://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/motiffinder/index.jsp) revealed that these DPMP-shoots-up genes are highly enriched for known defense-associated promoter motifs such as the hexameric motif TTGACT (p=2.92E-38) that matches the WRKY-binding W box element (TTGACC/T)44. Also, a TGA box core motif (TGACG) was represented in the significantly enriched hexamer TTGACG (p=2.41E-05). Interestingly, DPMP-shoot-down genes feature, along with response to stress and abiotic/biotic stimuli, the additional enriched GO term electron transport or energy pathways, which also includes genes involved in photosynthesis (see Supplementary Table S1). Defense responses are associated with increased demands for energy and plant respiration is highly stimulated during plant defense responses45. In contrast, studies on photosynthesis and plant defense have shown that photosynthetic metabolism is repressed locally during plant defense454647. It has been suggested that this might be due the high sensitivity of the photosynthetic apparatus for ROIs produced during the defense-associated oxidative burst45.. Comparison of sets of genes that were induced by pathogens or known elicitors revealed that 63% of all DPMP-shoots-up gene members are also inducible by the SA analogs DCA, INA and/or BTH3048. This may indicate that, like DCA, INA and BTH, DPMP also acts as a partial agonist of SA and mimics some SA functions (Fig. 7a). Additionally, 62% of all DPMP-shoots-up gene members are also responsive to infections with the oomycete Hpa, the bacterium P. syringae and/or the powdery mildew fungus Erysiphae orontii (Fig. 7b). Transcriptional responses triggered by these virulent pathogens are associated with basal defense495051.. We previously described the ACID (Associated with Chemically Induced Defense) cluster as a set of genes strictly associated with defense activation by two separate synthetic elicitors, DCA and INA30. Comparison of this cluster with the set of high dose (hd)-BHTC-shoots-up genes, we recently described31, and the set of DPMP-shoots-up defined a set of 75 genes that are commonly up-regulated by four distinct synthetic elicitors (DCA, INA, BHTC and DPMP). We termed this set SUPER-ACIDs (see Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S1), as its members are particularly tightly associated with chemically induced disease resistance. Enriched gene ontology (GO) terms43 suggested that collective roles of SUPER-ACIDs are in response to stress and abiotic/biotic stimuli as well as signal transduction (Table 1). Also the SUPER-ACID cluster contains many known defense-related genes and is highly enriched for genes associated with kinase activity (p=2.808e-08) and the cellular components of plasma membrane (p=5.920e-05), extracellular (p=8.781e-03) and nucleus (p=0.044). Furthermore, the analysis of promoter motifs of this cluster using the TAIR motif analysis tool revealed that these SUPER-ACIDs are highly enriched for known defense-associated promoter motifs such as the hexameric motif TTGACT (p=9.37e-151) that matches the WRKY-binding W box element (TTGACC/T)44. Also, a TGA box core motif (TGACG) was represented in the significantly enriched hexamer TTGACG (p=297e-80). Additionally, almost all (97%) SUPER-ACID members are also responsive to infections with Hpa, Pstand/or E. orontii (see Supplementary Fig. S5). All of these results support the conclusion that SUPER-ACIDs are important for disease resistance, and tightly associated with successful pathogen defense.. In roots, the number of DPMP-responsive DEGs was lower (558 DEGs), with 207 up-regulated (DPMP-roots-up) and 351 down-regulated genes (DPMP-roots-down) (see Supplementary Table S1 & Supplementary Fig. S3). However, the set of DPMP-roots-up genes shares similar putative collective roles with DPMP-shoots-up members. As in the case of DPMP-treated shoots, enriched gene ontology (GO) terms showed that this set also contains genes with likely collective roles in response to stress and abiotic/biotic stimuli as well as signal transduction (Table 1). Moreover, this set also contains established defense marker genes like PR2, LURP1, CaBP22 and WRKY genes. Genes down-regulated by DPMP treatment in root tissues further contain genes related to response to stress and abiotic/biotic stimuli. These results indicate that the role of DPMP-root members is also likely related to defense responses.. . . DPMP induces hormesis-like responses similar to BHTC in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, similar to the synthetic elicitor BHTC, DPMP significantly enhanced root length of plate-grown Arabidopsis plants at concentrations below 1muM, while high doses of DPMP reduced Arabidopsis root growth. In these assays, plants were grown on various concentrations of DPMP-containing 1/2 MS agar plates for 14 days. At concentrations 0.01muM and 0.1muM DPMP significantly enhanced the root length of Arabidopsis plants, while at concentrations above 1muM inhibition of root growth was observed (Fig. 8). The reduction of root growth on 10muM DPMP may be due to phytotoxic effects of this compound or due to re-allocation of metabolic resources away from growth-related processes to defense induction. Our data shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 suggest that DPMP at this concentration is not toxic to Arabidopsis. Interestingly, growth penalty effects are commonly observed when plant immunity is constantly induced due to mutations5253. Thus, most likely DPMP causes at high doses reallocation of critical resources to defense reactions. This can be clearly seen by the massive induction of defense gene expression..
PMC3617838	Results. . Expression pattern of LTP3 and localization of LTP3. LTP3 is induced by abiotic stress (Seo et al., 2011), implying this gene might be involved in the plant responses to abiotic stress. To study the biological function of LTP3, this study first examined the tissue-specific LTP3 expression in Arabidopsis. Total RNA was extracted from various tissues, including the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and siliques, and the transcript levels were analysed by qRT-PCR. LTP3 was strongly expressed in the cauline leaves, flowers, and siliques (Fig. 1A), a result that was verified by the GUS staining of the transgenic plants that expressed GUS driven by the LTP3 promoter. The GUS activity was high in the leaves, flowers and siliques but was low in the roots, stems, and seeds (Fig. 1B).. . Fig. 1.. . Expression patterns of LTP3. (A) LTP3 expression in various organs of Arabidopsis plants by qRT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from roots (RT), four-leaf stage seedlings (SE), rosette leaves (RL), cauline leaves (CL), stems (ST), flowers (FL), mature siliques (SL), and seeds (SD). The data represent the means of three replicates  SD. (B) GUS expression in seedlings at the two-leaf (i) and four-leaf (ii) stages, stem and cauline leaves (iii), inflorescence and flowers (iv), and mature siliques (v) of LTP3::GUS transgenic plants. (C-F) Expression of LTP3 under cold (C), drought (D), ABA (E), and MV treatment (F) by qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from plants treated with cold (4 C), drought, abscisic acid (ABA, 10 M), or methyl viologen (MV, 10 M) for the indicated times. The transcription levels were determined by qRT-PCR. The data represent the means of three replicates  SD.. . . . Next, the expression patterns of LTP3 were analysed by qRT-PCR under stress conditions. LTP3 was found to be slightly upregulated by cold stress after 3-6h treatment but was reduced thereafter (Fig. 1C). The transcript level of LTP3 was dramatically increased by dehydration and ABA treatment (Fig. 1D and E).. To determine the subcellular localization of LTP3, The pSuper::LTP3-GFP construct was generated and transformed into Arabidopsis protoplasts. The GFP signal was examined using confocal microscopy. The green fluorescence of the protoplasts harbouring pSuper::LTP3-GFP was observed throughout the cytoplasm; the control protoplasts containing pSuper::GFP were localized ubiquitously (Fig. 2A).. . Fig. 2.. . Subcellular localization of LTP3 in Arabidopsis protoplasts and the lipid-binding activity of LTP3.

(B) Purified recombinant LTP3-GST binds the TNS lipophilic probe. Recombinant LTP3-GST was expressed in E. coli, purified using GST beads, and incubated with increasing concentrations of TNS. Black triangles indicate recombinant LTP3 proteins (5 M), white circles indicate GST only, and black circles indicate the protein buffer control.. . . . . . LTP3 possesses lipid-binding activity. As LTP3 is a putative lipid-transfer protein, this study examined whether LTP3 exhibited lipid-binding activity using recombinant LTP3 and a fluorescent lipid substrate. The LTP3-GST protein was expressed in E. coli, purified using GST beads, and incubated with the fluorescent probe TNS, which emits an intense fluorescence when bound in a hydrophobic condition (Debono et al., 2009). The fluorescence increased intensely with increasing concentrations of TNS, with a binding Kd of 9.84.7 M (Fig. 2B). However, the fluorescence intensity did not increase with the TNS concentrations when a protein buffer or only GST was used. These results suggest that LTP3 protein has a lipid-binding activity in vitro.. . . Overexpression of LTP3 confers enhanced freezing tolerance. To dissect the biological function of LTP3 further, a T-DNA insertion line of LTP3 (SALK_095248), named ltp3-1, was obtained (Fig. 3A); qRT-PCR analysis showed that ltp3-1 was a loss-of-function mutant (Fig. 3B). This study also generated transgenic plants that overexpressed LTP3 driven by a Super promoter (LTP3-OE). A total of 20 independent transgenic plants were generated, and the T3 homozygous LTP3-OE3 and LTP3-OE4 plants were found to overexpress LTP3 (Fig. 3B) and were chosen for further studies. Under normal growth conditions, the ltp3-1 mutant plants and LTP3-OE plants were indistinguishable from the wild-type plants (Fig. 3C, Supplementary Fig. S1A). These results indicate that altered LTP3 expression does not significantly affect plant growth and development under normal growth conditions.. . Fig. 3.. .

The data represent the mean values of three replicates  SD; *P < 0.01 (Students t-test). At least three independent experiments were performed with similar results. (E) Ion leakage assay of the seedlings in (C) at the indicated freezing temperatures. The data are the mean values of three replicates  SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (Students t-test).. . . . To investigate the possible role of LTP3 under stress conditions, this study first examined the freezing tolerance of the wild-type, ltp3-1, and LTP3-OE plants. Two-week-old LTP3-OE and wild-type seedlings grown on agar plates at 22 C were subjected to a freezing treatment with or without cold acclimation, transferred to 4 C for 12h, and then returned to the normal growth conditions for 4 d and assayed. The survival rates of the non-acclimated LTP3-OE seedlings were much higher than the wild-type seedlings after treatment at -5 and -6 C (Fig. 3C and D). Consistently, following a cold acclimation at 4 C for 4 days, the LTP3-OE seedlings were more tolerant to freezing than wild type after treatments at -7 and -8 C (Fig. 3C and D). However, the ltp3-1 mutant resembled the wild-type plants with regard to freezing tolerance (Supplementary Fig. S1). Considering LTP3 shares high sequence similarity with several other LTP genes (Supplementary Fig. S2A), including LTP4, LTP8, and LTP12, this study checked whether their expression is affected in ltp3-1 mutant. Without cold treatment, expression of LTP4 and LTP12 was comparable to LTP3 in the wild type and ltp3-1 mutant. After cold treatment, the expression of LTP4 and LTP8 in ltp3-1 was higher than that in the wild type, whereas LTP12 expression in ltp3-1 was lower than the wild type (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These results suggest that the normal response of ltp3-1 mutant to freezing stress may due to the redundancy of LTP genes.. The electrolyte leakage as an indicator of membrane injury was measured in the non-acclimated and acclimated seedlings. The electrolyte leakage of the LTP3-OE seedlings was much lower than that of the wild-type seedlings in both non-acclimated and acclimated plants (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that the overexpression of LTP3 results in a constitutive freezing tolerance of plants.. . . Expression of stress-responsive genes in LTP3-overexpressing plants. The CBF pathway is known to play an important role in cold stress signalling (Thomashow, 1999). This current study next determined whether the enhanced freezing tolerance of LTP3-OE was caused by altered expression of cold-responsive genes in the CBF pathway. qRT-PCR analysis showed that CBF1, CBF2, CBF3, and their target genes, such as RD29A and COR47, were induced by cold in both wild-type and LTP3-OE plants; however, no obvious differences in the expression levels were observed between the wild-type and LTP3-OE plants before and after cold treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, LTP3 appears to be involved in freezing stress independently of the CBF pathway.. . . Overexpression of LTP3 increases soluble sugar accumulation. Because soluble sugar and proline are important osmolytes that protect plants against cold stress (Nanjo et al., 1999; Wanner and Junttila, 1999), the soluble sugar and proline contents were measured in wild-type and LTP3-OE plants. The LTP3-OE plants accumulated more soluble sugar than the wild-type plants at 22 C (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Cold stress induced the accumulation of soluble sugar in the wild-type plants, and the increase in the soluble sugar content in the LTP3-OE plants was higher compared to the wild type after cold treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A). In contrast, no notable differences in the proline levels were detected between the LTP3-OE and wild-type plants with or without cold treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4B).. . . Alteration in LTP3 expression affects plant responses to drought and oxidative stress. To investigate the role of LTP3 in other abiotic stress, this study next examined the effect of LTP3 on drought and oxidative stress. Two-week-old seedlings of ltp3-1, LTP3-OE, and wild type were exposed to dehydration by withholding water for 2 weeks. The plants were then watered and cultured continually for 1 week and the plant survival rates were measured. The ltp3-1 mutant was more sensitive to drought than the wild type, whereas the LTP3-OE plants exhibited an enhanced tolerance to drought (Fig. 4A and B). Moreover, ltp3-1 lost more water, whereas LTP3-OE lost less water than the wild type in the water loss assay of detached leaves (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the drought sensitivity of ltp3-1 was caused by the disruption of LTP3, a 2.0-kb wild-type genomic fragment containing LTP3 under the control of its own promoter was transformed into the ltp3-1 mutant. The transgene fully restored the drought-sensitive phenotype of the ltp3-1 mutant (Fig. 4A and C), indicating that the ltp3 mutation is responsible for the drought sensitivity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that LTP3 positively regulates the plant response to drought stress.. . Fig. 4.. . Phenotypes of ltp3-1 and LTP3-OE plants under drought and oxidative stress. (A) Drought-tolerance assay of the wild type, ltp3-1, LTP3-OE, and ltp3-1/LTP3 complemented plants. The plants were grown in soil, deprived of water for 2 weeks, and then watered. Similar results were observed in three independent experiments. (B) Survival rate of the plants in (A) under drought stress. The data presented are the means  SD (n = 30); *P < 0.05 (Students t-test). Similar results were observed in three independent experiments. (C) Water loss of detached leaves of the wild type, ltp3-1, LTP3-OE, and ltp3-1/LTP3 complemented plants. The data presented are the means  SD of three replicates (n = 30 for each experiment); *P < 0.05 (Students t-test). (D, E) Phenotype of ltp3-1 plants under methyl viologen treatment. The wild-type Col and ltp3-1 seeds were germinated at 22 C on MS medium containing 0-0.5 M methyl viologen. The photographs in D were taken on day 7 after stratification. The germination rates (E) are the means  SD of three experiments (n = 30 for each experiment); *P < 0.05 (Students t-test).. . . . The ltp3-1 mutant exhibited a hypersensitive phenotype when germinated on MS media containing different concentrations of MV, an oxidative stress inducer (Fig. 4D), and the germination rates of ltp3-1 were much lower than the wild type on MV-containing media (Fig. 4E). These observations, together with the strong induction of LTP3 by MV (Fig. 1F), suggest that LTP3 plays a positive role in the plant responses to oxidative stress.. . . MYB96 directly regulates LTP3 expression. To identify direct upstream regulators of LTP3, this study searched the publicly available data and found that LTP3 expression is decreased in a myb96-1 mutant and increased in a myb96-1D mutant that overexpresses MYB96 (Seo et al., 2011). This study obtained a loss-of-function mutant allele, named myb96-2, from TAIR and generated MYB96-overexpressing (MYB96-OE3 and MYB96-OE4) lines by transforming the pSuper::MYB96 plasmid into the Col-0 background (Fig. 5A). The expression of LTP3 was dramatically downregulated in the myb96-2 mutant and upregulated in the MYB96-OE plants compared to the wild type (Fig. 5A). Further MYB96-overexpressing lines were generated, in which MYB96 was driven by an inducible promoter (Zuo et al., 2000). MYB96 was dramatically upregulated after treatment with beta-oestradiol, and LTP3 was induced accordingly (Fig. 5B). These results imply that LTP3 might be a direct target of the MYB96 protein.. . Fig. 5.. . LTP3 is a direct target of MYB96. (A) Expression of LTP3 and MYB96 in 2-week-old wild-type Col, myb96-2, and MYB96-OE plants by qRT-PCR. The data are the means of three replicates  SD.

The MYB96-binding sites are indicated in (C) and the primers used for the ChIP-qRT-PCR are listed in detail in Supplementary Table S1. A coding region of LTP3 was amplified as a control. The data are the means of three replicates  SD from one experiment. At least three independent experiments were performed with similar results. (E) Transient expression of different pLTP3::GUS vectors with pSuper::MYB96 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The cotransformation of pZPGUS2 with the pSuper::MYB96 vector was used as the control. The data are the means of three replicates  SD. (F) EMSA assay for MYB96 binding to the promoters of LTP3. Each biotin-labelled DNA fragment was incubated with the MYB96-His protein. A competition assay for the labelled promoter sequences was performed by adding an excess of unlabelled wild-type or mutated probes.. . . . . . MYB96 can bind to the LTP3 promoter in vivo. MYB proteins can recognize the consensus CAGTTN motif in the promoters of their target genes (Urao et al., 1993). A sequence analysis revealed that the promoter region of LTP3 includes three CAGTTA elements, named the X, Y, and Z sites, respectively, within a 1.1-kb region upstream of the translation start site (Fig. 5C). ChIP was performed to determine whether MYB96 was able to bind directly to the LTP3 promoter in vivo. This study generated transgenic plants that expressed the MYB96-Myc fusion protein under the Super promoter, and the protein-DNA complexes were purified using an anti-Myc antibody. qRT-PCR was then used to detect whether the MYB96 protein can bind to the LTP3 promoter. As shown in Fig. 5D, the MYB96 protein strongly interacted with the fragment that contained the Y binding site but not the fragments that contained the X or Z binding sites or the exon region, implying that the Y binding site is important for the binding of MYB96 to the LTP3 promoter.. Then the tobacco transient cotransformation system that expressed the pSuper::MYB96 and pLTP3::GUS constructs was used to detect whether MYB96 can regulate LTP3 expression. pLTP3::GUS constructs driven by a series of LTP3 promoter fragments that contained different MYB96 binding sites were generated. In the presence of MYB96, the GUS activity increased significantly when the LTP3 promoter included the YZ or XYZ binding sites. However, a low GUS activity was detected in the LTP3 promoters that only contained the Z site or that did not contain an MYB binding site (Fig. 5E). Together, these results demonstrate that the MYB96 protein can specifically bind to the LTP3 promoter in vivo.. . . . MYB96 can bind the LTP3 promoter in vitro. An EMSA was performed to test whether the MYB96 protein binds directly to the LTP3 promoter in vitro. Recombinant MYB96-His protein from E. coli was purified and incubated with biotin-labelled probes. A shifted DNA-binding band was detected with the addition of MYB96-His and labelled DNA probes containing XYZ or XY sites, but no band was detected in the absence of the MYB96-His protein. The DNA binding was abolished with increasing amounts of unlabelled probe (Fig. 5F). To determine the binding specificity, the mutated XY-containing probe in which the CAGTTA sequence was changed to ACGTAT was used; no DNA binding was detected after incubation with the MYB96-His protein (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that MYB96 specifically binds in vitro to the LTP3 promoter containing the CAGTTA element.. . . MYB96-OE plants show LTP3-OE-like enhanced freezing tolerance. MYB96 is induced by different stress conditions, including ABA, drought, and salt stress (Seo et al., 2009). Therefore, this study addressed whether MYB96 was induced by cold stress. qRT-PCR analysis showed that MYB96 could be slightly induced by cold conditions: the expression after 3-h cold treatment increased 2-fold over the expression at 0h, and the expression decreased thereafter, returning to the basal level after 12h under cold conditions (Fig. 6A).. . Fig. 6.. . Freezing tolerance is enhanced by the overexpression of MYB96. (A) Expression of MYB96 under cold by qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from plants treated at 4 C for the indicated times. The data represent the means of three replicates  SD. (B) Freezing phenotypes of MYB96-OE transgenic plants. Two-week-old light-grown seedlings were treated at -5 C for 1h (NA) or -7 C for 1h after 4 C treatment for 4 d (CA), and the surviving seedlings were scored after a 2-d recovery. (C) Survival rate of the seedlings in (B) after freezing. The data represent the means of three replicates  SD; *P < 0.01 (Students t-test). At least three independent experiments were performed with similar results. (D) Ion leakage assay of the seedlings in (B) at the indicated freezing temperatures. The data are means of three replicates  SD; *P < 0.01 (Students t-test). (E) Expression of CBF genes in MYB96-OE plants by qRT-PCR. Two-week-old seedlings grown at 22 C were treated at 4 C for 3h. The data represent the means of three replicates  SD.. . . . To explore the role of MYB96 in freezing tolerance, the survival rates of the wild-type and MYB96-OE seedlings after freezing treatment were determined. The non-acclimated MYB96-OE lines were more tolerant to freezing than the wild type after treatment at -5 C (Fig. 6B). The survival rates for the MYB96-OE3 and MYB96-OE4 seedlings were 61 and 59%, respectively, whereas only 27% of the wild-type plants survived (Fig. 6C). A similar freezing-tolerant phenotype was observed in the acclimated MYB96-OE plants after being subjected to a freezing treatment (Fig. 6B and C). The electrolyte leakage was dramatically reduced in the acclimated and non-acclimated MYB96-OE plants versus the wild-type plants after the freezing treatment (Fig. 6D).. Furthermore, the expression patterns of CBF1-CBF3 in the MYB96-OE plants were not substantially altered compared to the wild type (Fig. 6E). Thus, MYB96 is involved in the plant response to freezing stress and is largely independent of the CBF genes.. . . Overexpression of LTP3 restores sensitivity to drought stress in the myb96 mutant. To investigate the genetic interaction of LTP3 and MYB96 further, this study generated myb96-2 LTP3-OE plants by transforming the pSuper::LTP3 plasmid into myb96-2 plants. The expression of LTP3 in the myb96-2 LTP3-OE mutant was higher than that in the myb96-2 plants, as determined by qRT-PCR (Fig. 7A). Notably, the constitutive expression of LTP3 fully restored the drought-sensitive phenotype of myb96-2 into the drought-tolerant phenotype of the wild-type plants (Fig. 7B and C). These results indicate that MYB96 acts upstream of LTP3 to function in drought tolerance.. . Fig. 7.. . Phenotypes of myb96-2 LTP3-OE plants under drought stress.

PMC3628222	Results. . Purification of Recombinant UGT74D1. In order to explore more hormone-related UGTs, in this study, we put our focus on other members of group L whose activity and substrate have not been previously demonstrated. These UGTs were cloned into prokaryotic expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST). UGT74D1 gene is predicted to encode a protein of 456 amino acid residues with a theoretical molecular weight of 50.2 kDa, thus the recombinant fusion protein should be 76.2 kDa together with GST tag. The SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the molecular mass of the purified fusion protein was between 66.2 kDa and 94.0 kDa, which was consistent with the theoretical prediction (Figure 2).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0061705.g002. Figure 2. . SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant GST-UGT74D1 fusion protein.. Proteins were purified from E.coli, analyzed on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. M: protein molecular weight marker; GST: glutathione-s-transferase; 74D1: fusion protein.. . . . . . Identification of UGT74D1 Enzymatic Activity Toward Auxins. Using UDP-glucose as the sugar donor, the recombinant UGT74D1 was tested in vitro for its glycosyltransferase activity against each of the seven substrates used in this study: indole-3-carboxylic acid [ICA], indole-3-acetic acid [IAA], indole-3-propionic acid [IPA], indole-3-butyric acid [IBA], the synthetic auxin analogs naphthaleneacetic acid [NAA], 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D], and picloram. The structures of these compounds used are listed in Figure S1. The following HPLC analysis and the recognition of new product peaks showed that the recombinant UGT74D1 had a strong activity toward IBA (Figure 3A). Therefore, we further conducted a LC-MS analysis to the new products. As shown in Figure 3B, in the positive ionization mode, putative IBA-glucose ester (IBA-Glc) gave a dominant ions m/z 204.15 (M+H+-glucose); m/z 366.16 (M+H+); m/z 383.17 (M+NH4+) and m/z 388.12 (M+Na+) (MW of IBA-Glc is 365.00). The mass spectrum peaks of putative IBA-Glc were identical to the peaks of a product catalyzed by UGT74E2 [23], which was demonstrated to be IBA-Glc and used as a positive control in our research (Figure 3C). Thus, a new biosynthetic pathway of IBA-glucose ester from the aglycone IBA by UGT74D1 catalysis was proposed (Figure 3D).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0061705.g003. Figure 3. .

As shown in Figure 4, UGT74D1 also had a significant activity toward other auxins with similar structure to IBA, for example, IPA, IAA and NAA, only a trace activity toward 2,4-D and ICA, whereas no activity toward picloram. The specific enzyme activities of UGT74D1 towards different substrates were also calculated (Table 1), and the data indicated that UGT74D1 was an auxin glycosyltransferase with the highest activity towards IBA.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0061705.g004.

Biochemical Characterization of UGT74D1. The results in Figure 5 summarize the effects of reaction conditions, including temperature, pH and buffer, on the catalytic activity of UGT74D1. Four temperature points were tested and the results showed that 37C was the best (Figure 5A). The pH analysis using Tris-HCl buffer, HEPES buffer, MES buffer, and phosphate buffer showed that UGT74D1 was active over a broad pH range but with a maximum in HEPES buffer at pH 6.0 (Figure 5B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0061705.g005.

Enzyme Activity Analysis of Transgenic Arabidopsis Plants Overexpressing UGT74D1. To gain further insights into the UGT74D1 activity, the transgenic plants overexpressing UGT74D1 driven by cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter were generated, and ten independent homozygous lines were obtained. As shown in Figure 6A, higher steady-state UGT74D1 level was observed in transgenic lines than that in wild-type plants. Seedlings of four transgenic lines were analyzed for enzyme activity toward IBA (Figure 6B). The results demonstrated that lines with higher UGT74D1 transcripts also displayed stronger enzyme activity than wild type to form IBA-glucose conjugates.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0061705.g006. Figure 6. . Analysis of the transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing UGT74D1 using the CaMV35S promoter..

(B) The glycosyltransferase activities in the crude protein extracts of transgenic plants and wild type were measured following the procedure described under Materials and Methods. The specific enzyme activity was expressed as pmol of IBA glucosylated to form IBA-Glc by 1 mg of protein per second of reaction time at 37C.. . . . . . Glucosylated Metabolite Analysis of Transgenic Arabidopsis Plants. To see whether the glucosidic metabolite is altered by enhanced expression of UGT74D1, exogenous IBA is applied to the transgenic and WT plants. As shown in Figure 7, if the plant tissues were not incubated with IBA before extraction process, IBA-glucose conjugates were below the level that could be detected or reliably quantified in our HPLC analysis. Upon application of IBA, however, considerable level of IBA-glucose conjugates were observed in both WT and transgenic plants. Compared to the amount of IBA-glucose produced in WT plants (130.81 pmol/mg.FW), much higher level of IBA-glucose in transgenic lines 74D1OE-23 (200.51 pmol/mg.FW) and 74D1OE-24 (277.55 pmol/mg.FW) can be detected. These data indicated that over-production of the UGT74D1 in the plants indeed led to increased level of the glucose conjugate of IBA.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0061705.g007. Figure 7. .

Peak a indicates the picloram added as an internal control at the beginning of the extraction process; Peak b indicates the IBA-glucose conjugates. The extracts were analyzed with a linear gradient of methanol in H2O from 10-70% (all solutions contained 0.01% H3PO4) over 30 min at 1 ml/min and monitored at 280 nm.. . . . . . Phenotypes of Transgenic Arabidopsis Plants. Two knockout mutants, 74d1ko-1 (Salk_004870) and 74d1ko-2 (Salk_011286), were confirmed to have no UGT74D1 transcripts (data not shown). Two transgenic lines over-expressing UGT74D1, 74D1OE-23 and 74D1OE-24, were also confirmed (Figure 6). Preliminary observation indicated that, although homozygous knockout plants and overexpression lines had the similar phenotypes with wild-type including shoot height, shoot branching and root gravitropism (Figure 8A, Table 2), UGT74D1OE plants displayed curling leaves that differed from those of the wild-type plants at flowering stage (Figure 8B, 8C, 8D). The curling leaf phenotype of UGT74D1OE plants began to emerge after growing for four weeks, but was even more pronounced after growing for five weeks (growth stage 6.5), suggesting a physiological role of UGT74D1 in affecting the activity of auxins in leaves at this developmental stage.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0061705.g008.

PMC2728481	Results. . Chromatin compaction correlates with geographic latitude of origin and local irradiation levels. To study natural variation in chromatin compaction, we examined the chromocenter phenotypes of leaf mesophyll cells from 21 accessions originating from a wide variety of natural habitats. We observed large variation in chromocenter size and number between accessions (Figure 1). To quantify this variation, we used the heterochromatin index (HX; [12]), which is a measure of the fraction of nuclei with conspicuous chromocenters (i.e. the typical Landsberg erecta (Ler) phenotype in Figure 1A) over the total number of nuclei. The variation in HX ranged from 0.19 (Cape Verde Islands; Cvi-0) to 0.92 (Kondara; Table S1).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000638.g001. Figure 1. . Ler nuclei display high chromatin compaction and conspicuous chromocenters, in contrast to Cvi-0.. Nuclei are counterstained with DAPI. (A) Ler nuclei have 6-10 conspicuous, round chromocenters. (B) Cvi-0 nuclei have fewer and smaller chromocenters. Bar=5 m.. . . . Because the 21 accessions originate from different geographic locations (Figure 2A, Table S2), we tested if geographic origin correlated with chromatin compaction. We found a significant (p<0.001) inverse correlation (r2=0.76) between HX and geographical latitude of origin (Figure 2A). Longitude and altitude did not display a significant correlation. Subsequently, we analyzed if local environmental conditions correlated with the chromatin phenotypes. We used mean annual climate parameter data acquired over a 30 years period ([24]; Table S2). Stepwise removing of the least-significant parameters from a multiple-regression analysis, revealed that mean annual irradiation (p<0.001) and annual amount of wet-days (p=0.01) may explain the geographic variation in HX. These parameters also correlated best with latitude (Table S2). Although day length is a clear latitude-dependent parameter that affects e.g. flowering time [25],[26] and circadian period [27], it does not have impact on heterochromatin compaction (data not shown). Apparently, the photon flux density (light intensity) rather than daily quantum input influences chromatin compaction.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000638.g002. Figure 2. . Chromatin compaction correlates with latitude of origin and light intensity levels.. (A) Chromatin compaction correlates with latitude of origin.

Error bars represent SE in al cases. Images show nuclei of Cvi-0 plants grown at 200 mol m-2 s-1 (left) and 600 mol m-2 s-1 (right).. . . . To test if light intensity directly influences chromatin organization, we examined the accession with the lowest HX, the sub-tropical accession Cvi-0, together with the commonly used Central-European laboratory accessions, Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Ler at different light intensities. Below 50 mol m-2 s-1, these accessions showed a lower HX than under standard conditions (Figure 2B). However, above 100 mol m-2 s-1 for Col-0 and 200 mol m-2 s-1 for Ler, the HX reached a plateau of 0.8-0.9. Strikingly, the HX of Cvi-0 increased over the entire range of light intensities used. These results confirm that chromocenter compaction depends on light intensity.. In contrast to HX, which assesses variation in chromatin compaction in a population of nuclei, the Relative Heterochromatin Fraction (RHF) reflects the chromocenter compaction per nucleus [14],[15]. The positive correlation between light intensity and chromatin compaction in Cvi-0 was confirmed by RHF measurements (Figure 2C). Together, these data indicate that below certain irradiation intensities, light becomes a limiting factor for chromatin compaction. This is reflected by a decrease of the nuclear fraction with conspicuous chromocenters resulting in lower HX. The threshold varies between different accessions and is above 600 mol m-2 s-1 for Cvi-0.. . . Altered localization of repeats and epigenetic markers in nuclei of Cvi-0. Chromatin compaction at chromocenters involves the condensation of repetitive DNA sequences such as the centromeric repeats, ribosomal genes and transposable elements [18]. To find out which sequences remain in the reduced chromocenters of Cvi-0, we applied Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) using the 180 bp centromere repeat, 5S rDNA, 45S rDNA and the BAC F28D6 (Figure 3A-3C). The latter contains many dispersed repeats such as transposons, which are predominant in pericentric regions (Figure S1). The 180 bp centromeric tandem repeats and 45S rDNA subtelomeric region displayed condensed signals at chromocenters (Figure 3A and 3C), similar to Col-0 and Ler. [12],[16]. In contrast, 5S rDNA and BAC F28D6 signals showed a dispersed pattern (Figure 3A and 3B). This suggests that the loss of chromatin compaction in Cvi-0 is caused by dislocation of pericentric repeats away from the chromocenters, comparable to the situation observed in gene silencing mutants such as ddm1 and met1. [15].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000638.g003. Figure 3. . Cytogenetic characterization of Cvi-0.. FISH signals for the centromeric 180 bp [(A), red] and the subtelomeric 45S rDNA repeats [(C), red] are compact and located at chromocenters. Signals for the pericentromeric sequences 5S rDNA [(B), red] and transposon-rich BAC F28D6 [(A), green] are dispersed and outside heterochromatic regions. For comparison, in Col-0 both the centromeric 180 bp [(D), red] and BAC F28D6 [(D), green] are compact and located at the chromocenters. Immunolabeling of 5-Methylcytosine [(C), 5-MC, green] reveals a dispersed pattern in Cvi-0 compared to the clustered immunosignals in Col-0 [(E), 5-MC, green]. Note the absence of 5-MC signal on the Cvi-0 45S rDNA sequences [(C), red]. Immunolabeling of H3K9Me2 [(F), red] reveals the absence of this epigenetic mark on NOR chromocenters at the periphery of the nucleolus [(F), arrows] in Cvi-0, while all chromocenters are marked in Col-0 [(G), red]. Histone immunolabeling on Cvi-0 [(F), green] was carried out as control for histones. Each nucleus was counterstained with DAPI (first column). nu: nucleolus; Bar=5 m.. . . . Since chromocenters contain most epigenetic markers for gene silencing [18],[28], we examined if the epigenetic patterns were affected in Cvi-0 nuclei (Figure 3C-3F). Immunolabeling revealed that 5-Methylcytosine (5-MC) is concentrated in chromocenters of Col-0, whereas in Cvi-0 the 5-MC label is dispersed over the entire nucleus (Figure 3C and 3D), similar to the pericentric repeats. Even the Nucleolar Organizing Region (NOR) chromocenters are hypomethylated. Hence, the dispersed 5-MC pattern, supports the FISH results, that low chromatin compaction at chromocenters in Cvi-0 is due to dispersed repeat regions. Immunostaining of H3K9me2 showed moderate dispersion and a diffuse signal at chromocenters in Cvi-0. Interestingly, both 5-MC and H3K9me2 labeling in Cvi-0 was markedly reduced in the large chromocenters that flank the nucleolus (Figure 3C and 3E). These chromocenters contain the rDNA genes (NOR) of chromosomes 2 and 4 [13],[29],[30]. This is not the case for Col-0 (Figure 3D and 3F), where all chromocenters show distinct H3K9me2 and 5-MC signals. Apparently, the ribosomal genes of Cvi-0 have decreased levels of both 5-MC and H3K9me2.. . . QTL mapping reveals three loci controlling chromatin compaction. We applied Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis to map loci controlling light-dependent chromatin compaction. For this aim, RHF was measured in 47 selected Ler x Cvi-0 Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) [31]. We based our analysis on RHF, because this is a composite quantitative trait that combines nuclear and individual chromocenter size and intensity, which is a strong valuation of chromatin compaction in each line.. Heterozygous lines of Ler x Cvi-0 and Cvi-0 x Ler crosses revealed a low RHF, indicating that the Cvi-0 RHF phenotype is dominant. The broad sense heritability (H2) was 0.4 indicating that 40% of the total variation is explained by genetic differences between the RILs. Three QTLs, designated Rhf2, Rhf4 and Rhf5, were above the permutation calculated Likelihood Of Odds (LOD) threshold [32] of 2.89 (Figure 4A). Together, these QTLs explained 53.2% of the variation in RHF in the population. No epistasis could be detected between the QTLs (data not shown).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000638.g004. Figure 4. . QTL analysis reveals three loci explaining the RHF.. (A) QTL-LOD profile of RHF per chromosome (CHR). The dashed line marks the 95% confidence threshold at LOD 2.89. Percentage explained variance and QTL names are given near each QTL peak. (B) Additive effect of the Cvi-0 allele compared to the population average. Boxes schematically show the positions of the Cvi-0 introgressions of the NILs used to confirm the QTLs. Numbers depicted are the LCN line-numbers. The average map position of the flanking Ler marker and the border Cvi-0 marker are depicted as cross-over position.. . . . Since Ler has a higher RHF than Cvi-0, QTLs with a negative allelic effect for Cvi-0 were anticipated. However, Rhf4 had a positive Cvi-0 effect implying the existence of both positive and negative molecular regulators contributing to the average RHF (Figure 4B).. To confirm the location and effect of the putative QTLs, we measured the RHF of Near-Isogenic Lines (NIL) covering and flanking the QTL positions. These NILs contain small Cvi-0 introgressions in the isogenic Ler genetic background [33],[34] (Figure 4B). For each QTL, we found one NIL with a predicted and significantly different RHF effect (Figure 5A). The introgression region in this NIL thus contains a Cvi-0 allele that contributes to the total observed low Cvi-0 RHF. Rhf2 is explained by NIL LCN2-5 (introgression on chromosome 2 between 22 and 27 cM). Surprisingly, LCN2-4 was not significantly different from Ler (Figure 5A), most likely due to the linked opposite QTL (Figure 4) at this locus which may repress the LCN2-4 phenotype. Alternatively, (flanking) positive, additive Cvi-0 alleles that are not detectable by QTL analysis may cause this effect. The Rhf4 region is explained by LCN4-3 and could be assigned, using other NILs, to 35 cM and 50 cM. Similarly, the region for Rhf5 was explained by LCN5-17 and could be restricted to only 3 cM (between 107 and 110 cM). Subsequently, we measured the HX of the two NILs with reduced RHF (LCN2-5 and LCN5-17). Both NILs had a reduced HX compared to Ler, confirming the observations with RHF (Figure 5B). When these lines were grown at 600 mol m-2 s-1 we observed significantly increased HX values in both lines, compared to plants grown at 200 mol m-2 s-1 (p<0.001 for LCN5-17 and p<0.01 for LCN2-5), while the HX of Ler remained unchanged. These data indicate that Arabidopsis chromosomes 2 and 5 contain loci (within the introgression of LCN2-5 and LCN5-17, respectively) that are segregating between Ler and Cvi-0 accessions and influence chromatin compaction in a light dependent manner.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000638.g005.

PHYTOCHROME-B and HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6 are involved in light-mediated chromatin compaction. Within the small introgression regions of LCN2-5 and LCN5-17 that contributed to the low RHF of Cvi-0, we selected the photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME-B (PHYB), and HISTONE DEACETYLASE-6 (HDA6) for further study, based on their annotation as light perception and chromatin component (Table S4, Table S5, Table S6). Although the chromatin remodeler DDM1 is also located on the introgression region of Rhf5, we did not consider this gene, since Cvi-0 has normal overall DNA methylation levels [35]. Both hda6 (hda6 sil1/not; [36]) and phyB5. [37] mutants showed a significantly reduced HX and RHF compared to Ler (Figure 6; Figure S2), indicating that these candidate genes affect chromatin compaction. Moreover, inactivating PHYB in a non-invasive manner, by application of low red-to-far red ratio light, mimicking natural canopy shade, did also result in a reduced chromatin compaction (HX; 0.340.13), comparable to the phyB5 effect. A low chromatin compaction has been described before for hda6. [18],[38], but not for phyB.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000638.g006. Figure 6. . PHYTOCHROME-B and HISTONE DEACETYLASE-6 are positive regulators of light-dependent chromatin compaction..

Error bars represent SE in al cases.. . . . Next, we performed complementation analysis [39],[40] on F1 crosses between mutant and wild types. In all cases, F1 lines from crosses with Cvi-0 showed low RHF levels and were statistically identical to Cvi-0, but never to Ler (Figure S2), indicating dominance of the Cvi allele(s). However, heterozygous F1 plants of crosses between phyB or hda6 mutants and Ler, in contrast to Cvi-0, showed intermediate levels of RHF (Figure S2; significantly different from both Cvi-0 and Ler), suggesting that none of these alleles is dominant.. To assay the light dependency of the chromatin compaction phenotypes in hda6 and phyB5, both lines were examined under different light intensities. In general, the mutants displayed a lower HX than wild type Ler (Figure 6). Similar results were obtained using phyB9 in the Col-0 background (Figure 7). At higher light intensities, the HX increased drastically in both mutants, illustrating the interaction between light intensity and chromatin compaction levels. Interestingly, we observed differences in the response to light intensity between hda6 and phyB5. Up to 200 mol m-2 s-1, the chromatin compaction in phyB5 increased rapidly to values close to Ler, whereas in hda6 the chromatin compaction increased steadily after 200 mol m-2 s-1, reminiscent of the pattern of Cvi-0. Thus, PHYB predominantly acts at low light intensity (<200 mol m-2 s-1), whereas HDA6 plays a role throughout the light intensity range. This demonstrates a novel function of the histone modifier HDA6. The data indicate that PHYB and HDA6 are positive controllers of light intensity-mediated chromatin compaction. However, we cannot exclude that other genes underlying the QTLs might also influence chromatin compaction.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000638.g007. Figure 7. . Ectopic expression of the Ler PHYB allele, but not the Cvi-0 allele, reduces chromatin compaction.. Heterochromatin index of phyb9 mutant in the Col genetic background, complemented with gain-of-function PHYB alleles from Cvi-0 or Ler. [41] at 200 mol m-2 s-1 in short-day photoperiod. Significance levels are compared to phyB9 values; * p<0.05; ns=non significant. Error bars represent SE in al cases.. . . . . . Segregating PHYB alleles contributes to the low chromatin compaction levels of Cvi-0. Recently, polymorphisms have been identified in PHYB between Ler and Cvi [41]. Ectopic overexpression of PHYB resulted in increased light sensitivity. However, overexpression of the Cvi allele sensitized the plant less than the Ler allele, indicating that the Cvi allele is less able to confer sensitivity to light. We examined chromatin compaction in phyB9 complemented with 35S::PHYB-Cvi and 35S::PHYB-Ler, to test if the same allelic variation accounts for variation in chromatin compaction. Both showed reduced chromatin compaction at 200 mol m-2 s-1, indicating that besides light reduction, increased light sensitivity also results in reduction of chromatin compaction (Figure 7). The 35S::PHYB-Cvi lines however, displayed a non-significant reduction, whereas the Ler allele conferred a significant (p<0.05) reduction. This confirms the reduced light sensitivity of the Cvi allele as compared to Ler.. The direct comparison of the data of the 35S::PHYB-Cvi and 35S::PHYB-Ler lines did not result in significant differences due to very small differences in effects between the alleles. This is in accordance with Filiault and co-workers [41] and supports their conclusion that the differences in effect of PHYB-Cvi PHYB-Ler are only small. This is also in agreement with the small additional effect of the Rhf2 QTL (Figure 4) and with the mild phenotype of NIL LCN2-5 (Figure 5). Therefore, we compared the effects of the transgenic lines with the null mutant phyb9, in the Col-0 genetic background independently, to increase the phenotypic-effect window. This did result in a significant difference between phyB9 and PHYB-Ler, but not between phyB9 and PHYB-Cvi, which strongly suggests that allelic variation in PHYB at least contributes to Rhf2 QTL. Alternatively, these effects can be explained by (differential) interactions between the alleles and factors in the Col-0 background [41].. Among the polymorphisms in PHYB segregating between Ler and Cvi, five are shared by Cvi and a clade of Spanish accessions [41]. At least two of these Spanish accessions; Ts-1 (HX=0.580.01) and Se-0 (0.670.02) show a low chromatin compaction compared to other European accessions. Together, these data suggest that variation in the PHYB sequence contributes to variation in chromatin compaction and likely explains the Rhf2 QTL.. . . Cvi differs from Ler in HDA6 sequence and resembles hda6 mutant in chromatin compaction. No sequence differences were found in the coding region of the HDA6 alleles in Ler, Cvi-0 and Col-0, except for the 5-UTR and the first intron (Figure 8). An intriguing feature was the presence of two base substitutions, each at an identical position in a small 13 bp repeat sequence in the 5-UTR region of HDA6 in Cvi-0. Subsequently, we examined if different HDA6 mRNA isoforms were produced in Cvi-0. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed no evidence for altered expression levels nor alternative splicing products (data not shown).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000638.g008. Figure 8. . Cvi-0 has HDA6 5-UTR polymorphisms compared to Ler and Col-0.. Schematic representation of the HDA6 (At5g63110) genomic sequence alignment in; Col-0, Cvi-0, Ler, and hda6 sil1/not. Untranslated regions (UTR; red), exons (blue boxes), and introns (orange bars) are shown along with the identified polymorphisms in bp relative to the ATG start codon. Hda6 represents the hda6 sil1/not mutant. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W 2.0 multiple sequence alignment and the alignment produced using EMBL EBI tools. The zoom-in box shows the sequence of the HDA6 5-UTR (red) and the start of the first exon (blue, start codon; bold/underlined). The small repeat sequences that harbor the polymorphism in Cvi-0 relative to Col-0 and Ler are shown in green (underlined) and the polymorphism site is shown in dark green. Note a G/A nucleotide substitution at bp 47 in the hda6 sil1/not mutant, which results in a predicted amino acid change from glycine (G) to arginine (R) in the hda6 sil1/not allele, confirming the results of Probst et al. [56]. Polymorphisms did not influence histone deacetylase signatures (as found using the NASC genome browser and extracting motifs using the SPRINT Prints view) nor potential miRNA targets, from http://sundarlab.ucdavis.edu/cgi-bin/mirna/.. . . . To further investigate the cause of the difference in RHF between the Cvi-0 and Ler heterozygotes, we dissected the RHF, which is a measure for the whole nucleus, into its components and examined the size of individual chromocenters (Figure 9). Small chromocenters are more frequently observed in Cvi-0 than in Ler (Figure 9A and 9B). This is not due to chromocenter association in Ler, since the average number of chromocenters per nucleus in Ler (8.3) is higher than in Cvi-0 (5.7). Cvi-0 lacks the very large chromocenters (>300 area units) (Figure 9B), which contain the NORs [13]. The fraction of large NOR chromocenters increases at higher light intensity (Figure S3), suggesting that NOR formation is controlled by light.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000638.g009. Figure 9. . NOR chromocenter size is specifically affected in Cvi-0 and hda6.. Distribution of size per individual chromocenter in Arbitrary Pixel Units (AU) of F1 plants derived from crosses between hda6 and phyB mutants and their parental wild types. Boxed numbers indicate the average number of detectable chromocenters per nucleus. The highest class for both distributions is defined on a 10% cutoff.. . . . Remarkably, hda6 resembles Cvi-0 in having small NOR chromocenters (Figure 9D), suggesting that Cvi-0 has a malfunctional HDA6 allele. In contrast, the size of NOR chromocenters in phyB equals those in Ler (Figure 9A and 9F), implying that chromatin compaction in the photoreceptor mutant is brought about by a different process compared to hda6.. Interestingly, the Cvi-0 phenotype with small NOR chromocenters, is dominant in the heterozygous Ler x Cvi-0 (Figure 9C) whereas the phenotype for small NOR chromocenters is intermediate (Figure 9C vs. 9E) in the F1 Ler x hda6. The added parental data (Ler + hda6) strongly resembles the distribution of chromocenter size in the heterozygote (Ler x hda6) (Figure S4). This indicates that half of the chromocenters in the heterozygotes have the wild type appearance and the other half have the hda6 appearance. This is particularly noticeable for the NOR chromocenters. In contrast, the distribution patterns of Cvi + Ler and the heterozygous Ler x Cvi-0 do not superimpose, pointing to inheritance of chromocenter size..
PMC2935865	ResultsPositioning of silique pedicels of Arabidopsis was influenced by the 3-D clinorotationArabidopsis plants grew up to the flowering stage (corresponding to Arabidopsis growth stage number 6; Boyes et al., 2001) in the greenhouse. Afterwards the plants with two siliques grew for 5d under the normal gravity (1g) stationary control condition or the simulated microgravity condition on a 3-D clinostat. Under the 1g control condition, Arabidopsis siliques formed upward angles on the inflorescence (Fig. 1A). When Arabidopsis plants were exposed to the 3-D clinorotation, an altered architecture characterized by orthogonal or downward-oriented siliques was observed (Fig. 1B). The angles between the inflorescence stem and the pedicels of the clinorotated plants ranged from 40 to 100, with nearly 40% of siliques oriented approximately perpendicular to the inflorescence axis (90) (Fig. 2). In contrast, the stem-pedicel angles of the 1g control plants ranged from 10 to 80, and >70% of them possessed an angle of 20-40 under the 1g control condition (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the angle between the inflorescent stem and pedicels significantly increased under the 3-D clinorotated growth condition.Fig. 1.Phenotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana plants (A) grown under normal (1g) gravity conditions (control) and (B) after growth on a 3-D clinostat for 5days. Scale bars: 10mm. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)Fig. 2.Distribution of angles between Arabidopsis inflorescence stems and silique pedicels. Arabidopsis plants were grown either under normal gravity (1g) conditions (Control) or under the 3-D clinorotated conditions (3-D) for 5d. The angle between the orientation of the transition zone connecting the main inflorescence stem and the pedicel was read in a clockwise direction and called the pedicel angle (alpha). The pedicel angle with respect to the inflorescence axes upwards is 0 and downwards is 180. The data represent the mean of five replications, and each replication contains 50 siliques of four plants. Bars designate the SD.Developing seeds in the silique are essential for the pedicel response to the 3-D clinorotationSilique growth and development were characterized by observations of the branching sites of seedlings (Fig. 3). Figure 3A shows that the angles of pedicels from P4 to P14 were significantly increased by the 3-D clinorotation. This was not the case for the older silique pedicels (e.g. from P1 to P3) and for the most recently formed silique pedicels at the shoot apex (e.g. P15), neither type of which demonstrated a response to the 3-D clinorotation. To determine whether the ability of the silique responding to the clinorotation depended on the development of seeds in the silique, the correlation between the presence of developing seeds and the gravity response of the siliques was studied. As seen in Fig. 3C the siliques (e.g. P15) at the apex of the shoot in which the embryos had just started to develop (2 days after flowering; DAF) exhibited no response to the 3-D clinorotation treatment. However, as the embryos developed to the globular stage (Fig. 3D, E), the siliques (e.g. P14) became responsive to the altered gravity. The most pronounced response of siliques to the 3-D clinorotation (e.g. P5 and P6) was observed when the embryos reached the heart stage of development at 5 DAF (Fig. 3F). As the embryos in the siliques completed their development (Fig. 3G) after 6 DAF, the siliques (e.g. P1-3 siliques in Fig. 3A) lost the ability to respond to the altered gravity created by the 3-D clinostat.Fig. 3.The ability of Arabidopsis pedicels to respond to the 3-D clinorotation changed during the development of seeds in the siliques. (A) Phenotype of an inflorescence stem of an Arabidopsis plant grown under 3-D clinorotated conditions for 5d. To establish a baseline that facilitated identification of the response of pedicels to the altered gravity, the pedicels (P1 is the pedicel of the first formed silique, P2 is that of the second silique, P15 is that of the 15th silique) were marked according to the position of the siliques on the inflorescence stem.

Scales bars: 6mm in (A), 3mm in (B), 20mum in (C), 50mum in (D-F), 200mum in (G). (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)To confirm further the influence of seed development on the response of siliques to the 3-D clinorotation, empty siliques (without seeds) were produced experimentally by removing anthers from the flowers before the pollen matured. In such plants, no difference between the angles of normal siliques (with developing seeds) and empty siliques was observed under the 1g control growth condition (Fig. 4C, D). However, on the 3-D clinostat, the angles of normal siliques increased (Fig. 4A, B) and the average angle was 70 (Fig. 4E), while the average angle of the empty siliques (Fig. 4B) was only 40 (Fig. 4E), which did not change significantly in comparison with those of both normal and empty siliques under the 1g control condition (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the presence of developing seeds in the siliques is essential for the pedicel response to altered gravity.Fig. 4.Responses of pedicels with empty or normal siliques to the 3-D clinorotation growth condition.

The distribution of pedicel angles of normal and empty siliques under the 1g control condition (D) and the 3-D clinorotation condition (E) is shown in the form of a histogram. The data of D and E were based on 150-200 pedicels of 20 plants from five biological repeats, and the angles of pedicels with empty and normal siliques were collected from the same plant. Scale bars: 6mm in (A-C). Bars in (D) and (E) indicate the SD.Effects of 3-D clinorotation on pedicel vascular patterning and branch point cell elongationThe vascular patterns of Arabidopsis pedicels exhibit dorsoventral asymmetry with respect to vascular positioning (Douglas and Riggs, 2005). To assess the influence of the 3-D clinorotation treatment on pedicel vascular patterning, serial transverse sections through the proximal regions of pedicels were made. Sections of pedicels of young siliques showed that the vasculature of pedicels consists of two lateral bundles and one abaxial bundle during early development (e.g. P15 in Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S2A-C available at JXB online). Pedicels at this stage of development did not respond to 3-D clinorotation. The adaxial bundles arise during the middle phase of pedicel development (e.g. from P9 to P14 in Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S2D, E, Fig. 5A, B), but the abaxial vascular bundles at this stage (e.g. P9 in Fig. 3A) were larger than the adaxial bundles in the 1g control samples (Fig. 5A, C). This difference between the abaxial and adaxial bundles disappeared in the 3-D clinorotated samples during the middle stage of pedicel development (Fig. 5B. D). The amount of vessel cells in the two lateral and the abaxial bundles was similar at the middle developmental stage and was not influenced by the 3-D clinorotation treatment, while the vessel cells in the adaxial bundle were significantly increased in the 3-D clinorotated samples in comparison with those in the control pedicels. The number of vessel cells in the adaxial bundles was only about one-fifth of that in the abaxial bundles in the controls, but the numbers of vessel cells in adaxial and abaxial bundles were almost the same in the 3-D clinorotated plants (Fig. 5E, F). These results suggested that the adaxial vascular bundle was more strongly influenced by the 3-D clinorotation compared with the other three bundles during the middle stage of pedicel development (e.g. P9-P14 in Fig. 3A).Fig. 5.Influence of the 3-D clinorotation treatment on the development of the pedicel vascular bundles. Fresh hand-cut transverse sections (A and B) and half thickness glutaradehyde-fixed sections (C and D) through the basal region of pedicels at 5days after flowering (e.g. P9 in Fig. 3A) were viewed using fluorescence and light microscope. Two lateral bundles (a left and a right bundle) and two middle bundles (an abaxial and an adaxial bundle) were observed in pedicels at this stage, but the adaxial bundle is obviously smaller than the abaxial bundle in the 1g control condition (A and C). The abaxial and adaxial bundle appeared the same size in the 3-D clinorotation condition (B and D). The ratios of the number of adaxial/abaxial (ad/ab) xylem vessel cells in the middle bundles (E) and left/right (L/R) xylem vessel cells in the lateral bundles (F) were calculated from the data based on 48 pedicels of 12 different plants from three repeats. ad, adaxial; ab, abaxial; L, left; R, right xylem vessel cells of vascular bundles.

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)Longitudinal sections through the node region of Arabidopsis plants grown on the 3-D clinostat and under 1g control conditions demonstrated that the overall patterns of the tissue types were similar (Fig. 6A, B). The cells in the adaxial region of the pedicel and main stem junction constitute the branch point site. As shown in Fig. 6C and D, the branch point cells become elongated under the 3-D clinorotation conditions compared with those in the 1g control plants (Fig. 6C, D; Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). Interestingly, the SEM results showed that the epidermal cells at the abaxial pedicel-stem junction of the 3-D clinorotated plants were shorter than those of the control (Fig. 6E, F), but there was no statistical difference in the average size of epidermal cells in the pedicel tissues between the 3-D clinorotated plants and the control (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Thus it is assumed that the elongation of the branch point cells might be one of the primary reasons for the enlargement of the angle between the pedicel and the stem under the 3-D clinorotation condition.Fig. 6.Influence of 3-D clinorotation on the development of branch point cells.

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)Expression of KNAT1 in the node regionPrevious studies reported that a KNAT1 null mutant, brevipedicellus (bp), showed downward-oriented siliques (Douglas et al., 2002), which is similar to the morphology of wild-type plants grown on the clinostat in this study (Fig. 1B). KNAT1 is expressed in the node region at the base of the pedicels (e.g. the branch point region) of proKNAT1::GUS transformants. Such transformanats were used to study KNAT1 expression under 3-D clinorotated and 1g stationary control growth conditions. The GUS activity in branch point cells of the 3-D clinorotated samples (Fig. 7D-F) showed a drastic reduction compared with the control samples (Fig. 7A-C). Serial cross-sections through the node region showed that in the cortical tissues there was no difference in GUS expression between the 3-D rotated samples and the controls. In contrast, GUS activity decreased in the branch point cells of the 3-D clinorotated samples (Fig. 7K-N) compared with the controls (Fig. 7G-J).Fig. 7.Influence of 3-D clinorotation on the expression pattern of KNAT1 in the node region.

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)The relative transcript level of KNAT1 in the pedicel node region was determined using real-time PCR (Fig. 8A). This analysis demonstrates that the expression of KNAT1 in the node of the 3-D clinorotated plants was only about one-third of that of the control (Fig. 8A). The KNAT1-overexpressing plants, pro35S::KNAT1 transformants, were also rotated on the 3-D clinostat. The result showed that the pedicels of pro35S::KNAT1 plants were insensitive to the 3-D clinorotation (Fig. 8B, C) and consistent with the hypothesis that KNAT1 might be involved in the response of pedicels to 3-D clinorotation.Fig. 8.KNAT1 expression in the node region of the main inflorescence stems of both Arabidopsis wild-type (WT) and KNAT1-overexpressing (pro35S::KNAT1 transformants) plants grown under normal gravity (1g) or 3-D clinorotation conditions.

PMC3170557	Results. . Tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) in Arabidopsis. A starting point for the analysis presented here was the identification of ENT3 as the sole pyrimidine nucleoside uptake system in Arabidopsis seedlings (Chen et al., 2006; Traub et al., 2007). Therefore, a question was asked about the physiological function of other ENT-type transporters at this developmental state. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that besides ENT3- only ENT1-transcripts accumulated markedly in seedlings (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). ENT1 transcript levels were 85-fold higher and ENT3 transcript levels were 25-fold higher compared with those of ENT8, which was in third place (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). A more detailed analysis of ENT1 tissue-specific expression by corresponding promoter- reporter gene fusions was followed by a critical re-investigation of the subcellular localization of ENT1, so far assumed to reside in the plasma membrane (Li and Wang, 2000; Wormit et al., 2004).. Seedlings carrying ENT1:GUS constructs that were analysed 2 d after germination had staining in distinct regions of the root; within the elongation zone, in the root-hair , and at the transition to the shoot (Fig. 1A, B). In cross-sections, most of the staining was confined to the root cortex (Fig. 1C, D). Cotyledons from ENT1:GUS seedlings were also characterized by an intense accumulation of colour (Fig. 1A). In fully developed leaves, GUS staining was restricted to hydathodes (Fig. 1E). In mature flowers, GUS expression was restricted to pollen (Fig. 1F, G). In vitro-germinated pollen show GUS expression in mature pollen tubes, whereas in germinated pollen tubes no staining was visible (Fig. 1H). In a proteome study, ENT1 was found in the vacuolar membrane of Arabidopsis mesophyll cells (Jaquinod et al., 2007) and this was confirmed with our own proteome studies (O Trentmann and HE Neuhaus, unpublished data). To verify this result, highly purified vacuoles (see Supplementary Fig. S2A at JXB online) were probed with an ENT1-specific polyclonal antiserum which stained a protein of the expected size of 49 kDa (see Supplementary Fig. S2B at JXB online). By contrast, in a crude extract, no staining was visible. Similarly, the preimmune serum showed no detection of protein (see Supplementary Fig. S2C at JXB online). To corroborate these findings, ENT1 mutants were analysed for their adenosine contents, which represents the main substrate of ENT1. For this, an RNAi-approach was chosen and, in addition, 35S:ENT1 mutants were generated. While transcript levels were reduced to 46%, 43%, and 30% in seedlings of ENT1-RNAi-lines #39, #38, and #42, respectively (Fig. 2A) in six over-expresser lines (1, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 16) the ENT1 transcript level was elevated 9-fold to 1060-fold (Fig. 2B). When the adenosine contents in seedlings of both types of mutants were analysed, it became obvious that ENT1-RNAi-lines contained more adenosine compared with the WT, whereas 35S:ENT1 lines contained less adenosine (Fig. 3A). In detail, the adenosine content of WT leaves was 2.6 nmol g-1 FW, whereas over-expresser mutants contained 1.1-1.9 nmol adenosine g-1 FW (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the adenosine contents of ENT1-RNAi mutants were increased relative to WT leaves and accounted for 3.4-6.6 nmol g-1 FW (Fig. 3A). Assuming that ENT1 resides in the vacuolar membrane, it was of interest to check whether the main substrates of ENT1, adenosine, could be found inside the vacuole. Therefore, a lumen fraction of highly purified vacuoles was concentrated and derivatized with chloroacetaldehyde. Subsequently, adenine derivatives were analysed by HPLC. Besides significant amounts of adenosine, 23-cyclic AMP, an intermediate of RNA degradation was the only further derivatized metabolite detected in the analysis. Measured contents of adenosine in vacuoles prepared from WT, 35S:ENT1 line #9 and ENT1-RNAi line #42 were 22.802.66 pmol U-1mannosidase, 9.14.84 pmol U-1 mannosidase, and 49.67.23 pmol U-1 mannosidase, respectively (Fig. 3B). In addition, 2'3'-cyclic AMP was quantified and accounted for 147.829.54 pmol U-1 mannosidase in WT vacuoles, 70.218.32 pmol U-1 mannosidase in 35S:ENT1 (line #9) vacuoles, and 320.245.89 pmol U-1 mannosidase in ENT1-RNAi (line #42) vacuoles, respectively (Fig. 3C).. .

Data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments (6SE). The asterisks indicate significant differences between WT and mutants, based on Student's t test (*P <0.05, **P <0.01, ***P <0.005).. . . . These results point to a function of ENT1 in the release of adenosine from the vacuole. To verify this assumption experimentally, vacuolar membrane protein was reconstituted into liposomes preloaded with [14C]-adenosine (50 mM), and the release of label was monitored over 30 min. While liposomes containing vacuolar membrane protein from the WT released a maximum amount of label after 30 min incubation, accounting for 4.56 nmol mg-1 protein, liposomes containing vacuolar membrane protein from 35S:ENT1 over-expresser line #9 released double the amount compared with WT liposomes, a maximum of 7.87 nmol mg-1 protein after 30 min (Fig. 3D). Liposomes containing vacuolar membrane protein from ENT1-RNAi line #38 released slightly less adenosine compared with wild-type controls at all three time points measured. By applying a similar reconstitution technique it was shown that only membrane protein inserted in the native orientation were functional (Trentmann et al., 2007) supporting the view that ENT1 functions in adenosine export from the vacuole in vivo.. In addition to these metabolic alterations, all 35S:ENT1 over-expressers showed clear growth deficiencies on soil 5 weeks after germination (Fig. 4A). Analysis of fresh weights of above-ground tissues from such plants revealed that ENT1-over-expression lines accumulated 107.9-126.7 mg fresh weight while WT plants accumulated 231.7 mg fresh weight (Fig. 4A). These growth deficiencies were accompanied by an increased activity of the salvage pathway enzyme adenosine kinase (AK). AK activity increased by 20-40% in most 35S:ENT1 lines, except for line #5 which exhibited an increase in AK activity of 10% (Fig. 4B). The AK activity of wild-type leaves accounted for 80 nmol mg-1 protein h-1 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, a marked increase in ENT7 transcript level was noted whereas all other ENT transcripts were unaffected. In seedlings, this increase was dramatic and quite comparable with the increase in ENT1 transcript accumulation in most mutant lines (Fig. 2B).. . Fig. 4.. . Characterization of 35S:ENT1 lines.

The asterisks indicate significant differences between mutant and WT samples, based on Student's t test (* P<0.05, **P <0.01, ***P <0.005).. . . . . . Molecular analysis of ENT1 over-expressers and RNAi-mutants with respect to pollen morphology and physiology. As ENT1 showed marked expression in pollen (Fig. 1F-H), it was investigated whether corresponding mutants interfere with pollen development or germination. In the ENT1-RNAi mutants in vitro germination of pollen on agar medium according to Fan et al. (2001) was significantly reduced and pollen appeared in the form of tetrads (Fig. 5), whereas 35S:ENT1 over-expresser mutants were unobtrusive. Therefore, we concentrate on the analysis of ENT1-RNAi lines in the following. Whereas WT pollen germinated to about 52% after 20 h incubation on synthetic germination medium, RNAi mutants exhibited only 33.5%, 36%, and 34.7% germination efficiency in lines 38, 39, and 42, respectively (Fig. 5A). It was observed that pollen from all RNAi mutants appear as tetrads when spotted directly on to agar whereas pollen from wild-type plants produce single pollen (Fig. 5B). 87.4-99.8% of RNAi mutant pollen showed tetrad formation, whereas this was never observed in WT pollen (Fig. 5C).. . Fig. 5.. . Analysis of pollen morphology and in vitro germination. (A) Germination efficiency of WT and ENT1-RNAi mutant pollen.

Single pollen and tetrads were counted after dipping anthers onto agar plates. Standard errors are below 5%. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . . . Adenosine uptake and contents of internal and extracellular ATP in ENT1-RNAi mutant pollen. Nucleoside uptake had been demonstrated before on petunia pollen (Kamboj and Jackson, 1995). To test whether Arabidopsis pollen grains are also able to take up nucleosides, the import of radiolabelled adenosine was measured. [2,8-3H]-labelled adenosine could be imported into intact pollen, showing a constant rate for at least 20 min. After 20 min, uptake accounted for 3 pmol/106 pollen (Fig. 6). After this time, adenosine import further increased up to 120 min (Fig. 6). Interestingly, uptake of adenosine in the strongest RNAi-line #42 was markedly reduced at all the time points analysed. After 60 min WT pollen exhibited an adenosine import of 8 pmol/106 pollen whereas RNAi line #42 only imported 1 pmol/106 pollen (Fig. 6).. . Fig. 6.. . Adenosine uptake in pollen from WT- and ENT1-RNAi-mutant plants. Time-dependent uptake of [2,8-3H]-adenosine [3 muM] into freshly isolated pollen from WT (open squares) and ENT1-RNAi line #42 (closed diamonds). The asterisks indicate significant differences between mutant and WT samples based on Student's t test (*P <0.05, **P <0.01, ***P <0.005).. . . . The reduced ENT1 transcript levels of ENT1-RNAi lines were accompanied by markedly lowered internal ATP contents (Fig. 7A). Internal ATP (iATP) was measured with a luciferin/luciferase system on perchloric acid extracts of pollen. In WT pollen, 262 pmol ATP/106 pollen were detected, whereas ENT1-RNAi lines #38, #39, and #42 contained only 144 pmol ATP/106 pollen, 124 pmol ATP/106 pollen, and 87 pmol ATP/106 pollen, respectively (Fig. 7A).. .

Black bars, WT; white bars, ENT1-RNAi mutants. Data represent the mean of three independent experiments (SE) The asterisks indicate significant differences between mutant and WT samples based on Student's t test (*P <0.05, **P <0.01, ***P <0.005).. . . . In recent years a role of extracellular ATP in plant growth processes became obvious (Demidchik et al., 2003; Jeter et al., 2004) and this also holds true for pollen germination as demonstrated by inhibitory effects of exogenously added ATP and by studies with apyrase knockout mutants (Steinebrunner et al., 2003; Wolf et al., 2007). Therefore, the ATP export of a pollen suspension spread on to agar was determined with a luciferase/luciferin test system. First, in a time-dependent assay, ATP export was observed linearly for 20 min. At this time point, WT pollen released 42.1 pmol ATP/106 pollen (Fig. 7B). ENT1-RNAi-lines #38, #39, and #42 released only 11.3 pmol ATP/106 pollen, 5.0 pmol ATP/106 pollen, and 7.8 pmol ATP/106 pollen, respectively (Fig. 7B). These data show that limiting the level of ENT1 correlates with a decrease in ATP export from pollen grains leading to lowered eATP levels..
PMC3542049	Results. . Cytoskeletal inhibitors differentially affect root growth in fh1 mutant and wild-type seedlings. Two Arabidopsis T-DNA mutant lines, fh1-1 and fh1-2, with corresponding wt controls were characterized. The T-DNA insertion interrupts the AtFH1 gene in the third exon in fh1-1 and in the 5 untranslated region (UTR; 27bp before start codon) in fh1-2 (Fig. 1A). In homozygous seedlings, AtFH1 mRNA was undetectable in fh1-1, while fh1-2 had a reduced transcript level (Fig. 1B).. . Fig. 1. . . The AtFH1 (At5g25500) locus and mutants. (A) AtFH1 protein domain structure (above); map of the AtFH1 gene and location of T-DNA insertions (below: open boxes, coding exons; filled boxes, non-coding exons; lines, introns and non-transcribed sequences). (B) AtFH1 transcripts in wt and homozygous mutant seedlings determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.. . . . Under standard growth conditions in soil or in vitro, fh1-1 and fh1-2 plants do not differ noticeably from the wt. The in vitro growth media were thus supplemented with anti-cytoskeletal drugs LatB and/or Oryz to enhance expected subtle cytoskeletal defects and uncover novel mutant phenotypes.. At 0.1 M concentration, the actin polymerization inhibitor LatB caused a more severe increase in root diameter and reduction in the longitudinal root growth rate in young seedlings of both mutant lines compared with the wt; the difference developed gradually within the first 48h on LatB (Fig. 2). Higher concentrations severely affected both genotypes, and the difference between the mutant and wt was no longer significant (Supplementary Fig. S1A, B available at JXB online).. . Fig. 2. . . Mutants lacking AtFH1 exhibit thicker, slower growing roots than the wt when treated with 0.1 M LatB. (A) Root diameter and (B) incremental root growth during 72h after transfer to LatB. Significant differences between any of the mutants and the wt in root diameter (t-test P < 0.0001) or root growth (t-test P < 0.05) are marked by asterisks. (C) Gradual decrease in root growth rates after 24, 48, and 72h on LatB. Significant differences between mutant and wt seedlings (t-test P < 0.0001) are marked by asterisks; data from the last 24h before transfer are shown for control.. . . . While the microtubule-depolymerizing drug Oryz also caused root thickening and reduced root growth, its effect was similar in both fh1 and wt seedlings. (Supplementary Fig. S1C, D at JXB online). However, simultaneous addition of 0.33 M LatB (i.e. a concentration that equally affected mutant and wt roots) increased the sensitivity of fh1 mutants to a low concentration of Oryz compared with the wt (Supplementary Fig. S1E).. Next, the inhibitor concentrations at which root diameter showed half the maximal increase (D50) and at which roots showed a 50% reduction in growth rate (L50) were estimated from dose-response curves of mutant and wt seedlings. Radial root expansion was always more sensitive to inhibitors than longitudinal growth. For LatB, both D50 and L50 were significantly lower in the fh1 mutants than in the wt (Table 1).. .

Treatment with cytoskeleton-stabilizing drugs (jasplakinolide for actin or taxol for microtubules) resulted in reduced root growth and increased diameter in both fh1-1 mutant and wt seedlings. Both genotypes responded similarly, although longitudinal growth of mutant roots was significantly less affected by taxol (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online).. . . Cytoskeletal inhibitors affect cell expansion and root hair development in mutants. Reduced longitudinal root growth can be due to impaired cell division or elongation, or both. To evaluate the contribution of cell elongation, the length of mature trichoblasts and atrichoblasts in inhibitor-treated roots was measured. LatB-grown fh1-1 and fh1-2 roots had shorter, wider cells, suggesting that the phenotype is at least partly due to more isodiametric cell growth (Fig. 3A, B; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online).. .

(C) Abnormal root hairs found in mutant but not wt plants grown on 0.1 M LatB. (D) Percentage of abnormal root hairs in fh1-1 and wt plants grown in LatB- and Oryz-supplemented media. Significant differences (t-test P < 0.001) are marked by an asterisk.. . . . Mutant rhizodermis cells, especially trichoblasts, were often mis-shapen, exhibiting bulbous structures at root hair bases and/or branched root hairs (Fig. 3C). A significantly higher density of both total and abnormal root hairs was found in mutant, but not wt, seedlings grown on 0.1 M LatB compared with drug-free control, apparently due to shorter trichoblasts. At 0.33 M LatB, the total number of root hairs was reduced in both genotypes; mutants had more abnormal root hairs than the wt. A further increase in the LatB concentration completely inhibited root hair development. While fh1 mutants showed, on average, longer root hairs than the wt on control media or 0.1 M LatB or Oryz, their root hairs were shorter on 0.33 M LatB, suggesting increased sensitivity of tip growth to higher LatB doses. However, since root hair length varied substantially, the biological significance of this observation is questionable (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online).. . . Actin and microtubule distribution in fh1 mutants. In the above experiments, both fh1 allelles behaved similarly, though fh1-1 had more pronounced phenotypes, in agreement with the residual gene expression in fh1-2. fh1-1 was thus chosen for introduction of in vivo fluorescent protein-tagged cytoskeletal markers (GFP-FABD for actin and GFP-MAP4 for microtubules) by crossing. Sister segregants carrying wt AtFH1 were used as controls.. The effects of the markers themselves on root growth in both fh1-1 and the wt were examined. GFP-MAP4 caused root thickening and reduction of root growth, and induced left-handed root twisting, as described previously (Granger and Cyr, 2001; Hashimoto, 2002); these effects were less pronounced in fh1-1mutants than in the wt. GFP-FABD did not show any significant effects in either fh1-1 or wt seedlings (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online).. Given that this study was looking at root development, the focus here was on in vivo observations in rhizodermal cells. Thicker and more frequent actin bundles were usually observed in fh1 mutants than in wt seedlings. Low doses of LatB did not disrupt filaments but rather increased actin bundling, more obviously in mutants than in wt plants. LatB-treated wt plants thus somewhat resembled fh1 mutants grown under control conditions (Fig. 4A). Quantification of the microfilament patterns in the rhizodermis of seedlings growing on control media by estimating the skewness of fluorescence intensity distribution (correlated with the level of microfilament bundling) and pixel occupancy (giving insight into the overall density of actin cytoskeleton) showed that mutants have fewer but thicker microfilaments, consistent with increased actin bundling (Fig. 4B). The differences are even more obvious in profiles of individual bundle fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4C), confirming that fh1 mutants have fewer weakly labelled thin bundles or single filaments, and more bright thick bundles than wt plants.. . Fig. 4. . . Typical cytoskeleton organization in the rhizodermis of fh1-1 mutant and wt seedlings. (A) Actin labelled by GFP-FABD; arrows, actin filament bundles.

(C) Frequency distribution of actin fluorescence peaks in four fluorescence intensity classes under control conditions. (D) Microtubules labelled by GFP-MAP4. (E) Microtubule density. Significant differences (t-test P < 0.001) are marked by an asterisk.. . . . Surprisingly, differences in microtubule organization between the wt and mutants were more pronounced than those in microfilaments. Even on control media, and more obviously in LatB-treated plants, mutants had fewer microtubules, shorter and less organized compared with the wt (Fig. 4D). Quantitative measurements of microtubule density revealed a significant reduction in LatB-treated fh1 mutants compared with the wt (Fig. 4E).. . . Effect of fh1 mutation on cytoskeletal dynamics monitored by VAEM. To compare individual microfilament and microtubule dynamics in rhizodermis cells of wt and fh1 mutant plants carrying GFP-FABD and GFP-MAP4, the VAEM technique was employed. Since preliminary experiments indicated that the three developmental zones of the root tip differ in cytoskeletal dynamics, the beginning of the differentiation zone was investigated, where both cytoskeletal systems behaved consistently very dynamically.. Differences in actin dynamics were observed between fh1 mutants and the wt (Fig. 5; Supplementary Video S1, S2 at JXB online). Mutant microfilament bundles were more abundant and less dynamic (in particular, they remained longer at pause) than those of wt seedlings, except a few rapidly moving bundles. This might reflect differences either in bundle size or in the degree of actin cross-linking.. . Fig. 5. . .

Differences between mutant and wt plants were also observed in microtubule dynamics (Fig. 6; Supplementary Video S3, S4 at JXB online).

An asterisk indicates a significant difference between mutants and the wt (t-test P < 0.0001).. . . . To quantify microtubule turnover, the distribution of microtubule phases was determined in images taken during the time span of 2min. Mutants had fewer shrinking or pausing microtubules but more microtubules undergoing stochastic transition (i.e. alternatively shrinking and growing) than the wt (Fig. 6C). LatB reduced the fraction of growing microtubules in both genotypes, and increased the fraction of growing/shrinking microtubules even in the wt (again, LatB-treated wt plants resembled fh1 mutants grown under control conditions). Oryz in both genotypes increased the percentage of pausing microtubules and reduced the growing, shrinking, and growing/shirinking fractions. The distribution of microtubule growth and shrinkage rates differed somewhat between fh1 and wt roots (Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). Despite comparable average growth rates, a higher proportion of microtubules in fh1 cells grew more slowly than average; this difference persisted upon LatB treatment, while Oryz reduced the growth rate in both the fh1 mutant and the wt.. . . Effects of the formin inhibitor SMIFH2 mimic the fh1 mutation. To verify that the observed mutant phenotypes are due to disrupted formin function, the effects of a recently described inhibitor of formin-mediated actin assembly, SMIFH2 (Rizvi et al., 2009), were examined in wt seedlings. In the standard experimental set-up, significant reduction of root growth was observed at or above a concentration of 20 M in both the wt and fh1 mutants (Fig. 7A). The effect of SMIFH2 was stronger when seedlings were exposed to the drug in the dark (possibly due to light sensitivity of the drug), and fh1-1 mutant roots were significantly more affected than those of the wt (Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online). SMIFH2-treated wt seedlings expressing GFP-FABD and GFP-MAP4 exhibited increased microfilament bundling and reduced microtubule density, especially after additional LatB treatment, again reminiscent of fh1 mutants (Fig. 7B).. .

PMC4938710	Results. . Mutants Affected in H2A.Z Incorporation Have Diverse Developmental and Immunity Phenotypes. To study the role of H2A.Z in plant defense processes, we analyzed mutants defective in SWR1 complex components PIE1, ARP6, and SWC6, as well as those depleted of the histone variant H2A.Z. Consistent with previous studies, pie1-2 (Noh and Amasino, 2003), arp6-1 (Deal etal., 2005), and swc6-1 (Lzaro etal., 2008) mutants showed pleiotropic growth and developmental phenotypes including early flowering, elongated petioles, and reduced fertility when grown in long photoperiod (LD) (Figure1B). The pie1 mutant showed the most severe growth defects and even though it displayed accelerated reproductive transition, bolting was delayed. The arp6 and swc6 mutants phenocopied each other with characteristic early flowering and serrated leaves. This was consistent with the biochemical interaction of ARP6 and SWC6 in yeast, where their existence in the complex is mutually dependent (Mizuguchi etal., 2004). The hta9-1 hta11-1 double mutant (loss of two major H2A.Z encoding genes out of the possible three in Arabidopsis) phenocopied arp6 and swc6 mutants with early flowering and serrated leaves. The severe growth defects in the pie1 mutant have been previously attributed to the de-repression of immune responses characterized by spontaneous cell death and upregulation of defense genes (March-Daz etal., 2008). Growth in short photoperiods (SD) largely suppressed some of the growth defects of the pie1 mutant, even though the rosette size remained significantly smaller compared with the other SWR1c mutants (Figure1B). All the studies reported here, unless otherwise specified, were performed on plants grown under SD.. SWR1c components have been proposed to be negative regulators of plant immunity with pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 mutants reported to display spontaneous cell death and enhanced resistance to virulent bacterial pathogens (March-Daz etal., 2008). The role of ARP6 in this process is still not known and has been expected to be similar to PIE1, SWC6, and H2A.Z. In order to investigate this, we characterized the defense responses of these mutants. In our experimental conditions, trypan blue staining revealed no apparent spontaneous cell death in the mutants (Figure1C). We occasionally observed patches of cell death and leaf torsion in some leaves of the pie1 mutant (Supplemental Figure1). To investigate their immunity phenotypes further, we challenged 4-week-old mutants with the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen P.syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) by spray inoculation and monitored bacterial growth. We found that pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 mutants showed more macroscopic disease symptoms and increased susceptibility towardPst DC3000 compared with the wild-type Col-0. However, the arp6 mutant showed increased resistance (Figure1D and 1E). Overall, pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 mutants accommodated 10 to 15 times more bacterial titers at 3days post inoculation (dpi) than the wild type. The pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 mutants displayed severely compromised resistance similar to that of the enhanced disease susceptibility1 (eds1-2) mutant, which was used as a susceptible control (Feys etal., 2001). There were no differences in the bacterial titers at day 0 (2h post inoculation) between the different mutants and the wild-type Col-0 plants. A transgenic SWC6 complemented line showed wild-type resistance to Pst DC3000 (Supplemental Figure2), suggesting that the resistance phenotype we observe is caused by the mutation. Our observations suggest that H2A.Z, PIE1, and SWC6 are essential for basal resistance in Arabidopsis, whereas ARP6 has an opposite function.. These results were intriguing as a previous study has shown that pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 mutants displayed rather constitutive defense activation marked by spontaneous lesions and disease-resistance phenotypes (March-Daz etal., 2008). As mentioned earlier, the pie1 mutant showed severe growth defects when grown under LD. These phenotypes were partially suppressed by growth under SD (Figure1B). In order to investigate whether the severe growth defects in pie1 under LD were due to constitutive defense activation and therefore to test if pie1 shows photoperiod-dependent defense phenotypes, we assessed its resistance to Pst DC3000 in these growth conditions. To bypass early flowering induction by constant growth under LD photoperiods, the mutants along with the wild type were pre-grown for two weeks under SD conditions before being shifted to LD for another two weeks prior to infection. Consistent with the results from the SD experiments, pie1 remained increasingly susceptible to Pst DC3000 (Supplemental Figure3A). Moreover, it showed no spontaneous cell death in the leaves under these conditions, similarly to the other mutants (Supplemental Figure3B), except for the patches of dead tissue observed as in SD. These results suggest that the growth defects in the pie1 mutant are not necessarily a consequence of enhanced defense activation. The defense phenotypes of arp6, swc6, and hta9 hta11 grown in LD were also similar to the results obtained under SD conditions (Supplemental Figure3A) further confirming that the immunity phenotypes we observed are not due to specific growth conditions, especially the photoperiod. These results also confirm that the contrasting defense phenotypes observed in this study and by March-Daz etal. (2008) are unlikely to be caused by growth conditions such as the photoperiod.. . . Resistance to Avirulent Pathogens Is Compromised inpie1 and swc6. During interaction with avirulent pathogens, recognition of effectors by the receptor proteins in the host plant leads to the activation of ETI. In Arabidopsis, the bacterial effectors AvrRps4 and AvrRpt2 trigger resistance through recognition by the toll interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-type and the coiled coil (CC)-type nucleotide binding-leucine-rich-repeat (NB-LRR) proteins RPS4/RRS1 and RPS2, respectively (Kunkel etal., 1993, Gassmann etal., 1999, Narusaka etal., 2009). To examine the possible roles of SWR1c and H2A.Z in ETI, we inoculated the corresponding mutants with avirulent Pst DC3000 expressing either AvrRps4 or AvrRpt2 effectors. The pie1 and swc6 mutants are more susceptible compared with wild-type in both interactions (Figure2A and 2B). They were, however, not as hypersusceptible as eds1 or ndr1 (non-race-specific disease resistance1), used as susceptible controls in response to AvrRps4 and AvRrpt2 (Century etal., 1995), respectively. Consistent with the earlier results, arp6 displayed full resistance like wild-type plants, suggesting that arp6 mutation does not alter RPS4- and RPS2-mediated resistance. The hta9 hta11 double mutant showed mild but not significant susceptibility compared with wild-type. In Arabidopsis, H2A.Z is encoded by three genes HTA9, HTA11, and HTA8. The presence of HTA8, even though generally lowly expressed (Supplemental Figure4), in the hta9 hta11 double mutant could compensate for the lack of HTA9 and HTA11. These results suggest that PIE1 and SWC6 have a positive function in ETI. Interestingly, ARP6 function appears to be dispensable.. To understand the basis of the failure to mount ETI, we examined the level of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, an important defense hormone in response to biotrophic pathogens and particularly during ETI (Robert-Seilaniantz etal., 2011). The basal level of SA did not noticeably differ between the the wild type and the mutants except for arp6, where it was higher (Figure2C). Interestingly, 24h after infiltration with Pst DC3000 AvrRps4, allthe mutants showed increased SA accumulation in comparison with Col-0. Accumulation of SA in pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 was 2-fold higher relative to Col-0, and reached 3-fold in arp6. Our results show that in spite of SA accumulation, resistance to virulent and avirulent P.syringae is impaired in pie1 and swc6 mutants, suggesting that SWR1c activity (especially PIE1, SWC6) and H2A.Z are required for SA-dependent downstream signaling processes. These results are further supportive to the resistance phenotypes of the mutants to virulent Pst DC3000 (Figure1D and 1E).. . . Role of SWR1c Components in Resistance to Necrotrophic Pathogen. Signaling crosstalks and antagonistic interactions between different defense pathways regulated by hormones have been extensively studied (Robert-Seilaniantz etal., 2011, Thaler etal., 2012). SA-mediated defense is activated during interaction with biotrophic pathogens while jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defense is active against necrotrophs and herbivores (Glazebrook, 2005, Howe and Jander, 2008). As presented earlier, pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 mutant plants showed impaired SA-mediated defense responses even though they accumulated a high level of the SA hormone in response to Pseudomonas infection. In order to investigate whether these mutants are affected in the SA/JA crosstalk, we investigated their resistance to the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cineria. Leaves of the wild-type and mutant plants were drop inoculated with spore suspension, and the growth of lesions was monitored. Average lesion size measured 3 dpi was significantly bigger in pie1, swc6, and hta9 hat11. The proportions of outgrowing lesion type IV (lesion over 6 mm in diameter) in pie1, swc6, and hta9 hat11 were higher compared with arp6 mutant plants that showed mild resistance (Figure3 and Supplemental Figure5). These results show that perturbation of H2A.Z incorporation results in a compromised JA/ethylene (ET)-mediated immunity. It also suggests that components of SWR1c do not play the same function in this defense pathway, as arp6 showed wild-type resistance to Botrytis, as opposed to the rest of the mutants.. . . SWR1c Components Have Distinct Functions in Gene Regulation. In order to elucidate the molecular basis of the phenotypes described above, and to dissect the role of H2A.Z and SWR1c subunits in gene regulation, we carried out a global transcriptome analysis of the wild-type and mutant lines using RNA-seq. Three replicates of total RNA from 2-week-old seedlings from each mutant were sequenced. Genes showing at least 2-fold change from the wild type with a P value cut-off of 0.05 were used for further analyses. We found that mutations in SWR1c components result in misregulation of a large number of genes (Figure4A and 4B and Supplemental Dataset 1). The pie1 mutation resulted in the largest number of gene misregulation, with 2295 genes upregulated and 1051 genes downregulated. This was expected, as PIE1 is the catalytic subunit of the SWR1 complex. The genes misregulated in our study showed statistically significant (hypergeometric test) overlap with the previously published data (March-Daz etal., 2008, Coleman-Derr and Zilberman, 2012).. We found a total of 671 genes to be commonly misregulated among all four mutants (473 genes upregulated and 198 genes downregulated). This accounts for 20% of the genes misregulated in pie1, and 22%, 32%, and 27% in arp6, swc6, and hta9 hta11, respectively. Moreover, the commonly misregulated genes (up and down) showed a statistically significant overlap with H2A.Z enrichment in the genebodies (Coleman-Derr and Zilberman, 2012). We found that 1262 genes were uniquely upregulated in pie1 accounting for 55% of the total number of genes upregulated in this mutant. In arp6, swc6, and hta9 hta11, however, only 20%, 4%, and 13%, respectively, wereuniquely upregulated. Similarly 50% of the genes downregulated in pie1 were unique. The proportions of uniquely downregulated genes were 25% in arp6, 4.5% in swc6, and 18% in hta9 hta11. The large proportion of uniquely misregulated genes in pie1 suggests a potential SWR1c/H2A.Z independent role for PIE1 in gene regulation.. To explore this further and to elucidate the relationship between individual mutants, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) of the RNA-seq data. The first three principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3) together accounted for 92.1% of the variance in the data (44.44%, 30.55%, and 17.11%, respectively) (Figure4C). It also revealed that the four mutant genotypes segregate into three distinct groups: swc6 and hta9 hta11mutants co-segregated while pie1 and arp6 mutants weredistinct. The second principal component (PC2) distinguished the mutants from the wild type. PC1 clearly separated pie1 from the rest of the group, whereas PC3 defined the contribution of arp6 (Figure4C and Supplemental Figure6). This analysis has further strengthened the possibility of non-overlapping functions for the complex components. In line withthe PCA analysis, differential gene expression analyses showed a poor correlation of gene misregulation caused by arp6 and pie1 mutations (r2= 0.16) (Figure4D), as well as between hta9 hta11 and pie1 (r2=0.11) (Figure4E), which is surprising as pie1 mutation is expected to phenocopy H2A.Z depletion to a large extent. The arp6 and swc6 mutants in Arabidopsis have similar morphological and developmental phenotypes, especially early flowering and serrated leaves. Moreover, ARP6 and SWC6 have been shown to physically interact in Arabidopsis (March-Diaz etal., 2007, Lzaro etal., 2008). Intriguingly, in our RNA-seq data, the transcriptional changes due to these mutations did not show a strong correlation (r2= 0.42) (Figure4F). This observation is consistent with the defense phenotypes described above, suggesting that ARP6 and SWC6 could have distinct functions in Arabidopsis. In agreement with the PCA analysis, swc6 and hta9 hta11 double mutants displayed a strong correlation of transcriptional misregulation (r2= 0.75), indicating overlapping roles for SWC6 and H2A.Z in gene regulation (Figure4G). This is in contrast to arp6, which showed only a modest correlation (r2= 0.38) with hta9 hta11 (Supplemental Figure7).. To understand the function of SWR1c and H2A.Z in gene regulation, particularly in immunity, we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the mutant transcriptomes. We found a significant over-representationof SA response (P= 4.46 10-6) and defense (P= 7.75 10-3) related GO terms in the 473 genes commonly misregulated in the mutants (Supplemental Dataset2). This is in accordance with what was reported earlier (March-Daz etal., 2008). The commonly downregulated genes where enriched in triterpene (thalianol, P= 1.77 10-4 and tricyclic triterpenoid metabolic process, P= 7.04 10-4) related GO terms. In addition, pie1 showed a significant over-representation of several biological processes including auxin metabolic processes, membrane organization, and response to heat, indicating the important role of PIE1 in gene expression in general. In swc6 and hta9 hta11, the GO term response to heat was significantly enriched, which is consistent with H2A.Z function in response to temperature (Kumar and Wigge, 2010). We also observed that swc6 and hta9 hta11 mutants display an enrichment of hydrogen peroxide-related GO terms like in arp6 (Supplemental Dataset 2). Taken together, the results of the transcriptome analysis demonstrate that the components of the SWR1c have distinct roles in the regulation of gene expression in Arabidopsis.. . . PIE1 Functions to Coordinate Distinct Defense Signaling Pathways. Our RNA-seq analysis revealed that, in the SWR1c mutants, particularly pie1, genes required for disease resistance were misregulated as previously shown (March-Daz etal., 2008). Genes involved in systemic acquired resistance such as PR1, PR5, EDS5, and NIMIN1 were highly upregulated in pie1 (Figure5A-5D and Supplemental Dataset 1). The arp6 mutant showed modest upregulation of all the above genes except for EDS5. Only PR5 among these genes was upregulated in swc6 and hta9 hta11, but not to the same extent as in pie1. Interestingly, the pie1 mutant shows severely compromised resistance in spite of the enhanced expression of defense genes (as shown above). To further understand the molecular basis for this paradox, we analyzed the transcriptome further. We observed that genes encoding the WRKY family of transcription factors are upregulated in pie1 (Figure5E and Supplemental Dataset). WRKY transcription factors are important regulatory components during plant response to pathogen infection and abiotic stresses. Moreover, they have been implicated in plant immunity as both positive and negative regulators (Pandey and Somssich, 2009, Rushton etal., 2010). WRKY38 and WRKY62, in particular, are highly expressed in the pie1 background (Figure5F and 5G). These two WRKY proteins were shown to be negative regulators of resistance to pathogens. In line with these observations, the uniquely upregulated genes in pie1 are also enriched in GO terms related to negative regulation of the defense response (P= 1.02 10-9).. The pie1 mutant displays upregulation of SA-responsive geneexpression. SA is a key regulator of signaling networks involved in defense along with other hormones such as JA(Robert-Seilaniantz etal., 2011). SA- and JA-mediated defenseresponses are triggered in the plant depending on the nature of the pathogen (Van der Does etal., 2013). These two pathways act antagonistically to modulate defense responses. Activation of one pathway usually correlates with attenuation of the other (Thaler etal., 2012). Consistent with this, we found that the SA-inducible glutaredoxin gene GRX480, which has been proposed to antagonize the JA-responsive transcription of PDF1.2 is nearly 10-fold upregulated in pie1 (Figure6A). Transgenic plants ectopically expressing GRX480 displayed reduced JA-induced gene expression (Ndamukong etal., 2007). Surprisingly, JA-mediated responses were not suppressed in pie1. In fact, uniquely upregulated genes in pie1areenriched in GO terms related to the JA metabolic process (P= 9.12 10-32) and JA-mediated signaling pathway (P= 5.17 10-23). For instance, genes involved in JA biosynthesis (Figure6B-6D), signaling (Figure6E and 6F), and response (Figure6G-6I) were upregulated. We further analyzed the expression of JA-induced genes (Nemhauser etal., 2006) in our data and found that these are upregulated in pie1 compared with the other mutants (Figure6J), confirming that JA-responsive pathways are derepressed in spite of the SAR genes being upregulated. These observations, together with the upregulation of negative regulators of defense (e.g., WRKYs), could explain the unexpected disease susceptibility phenotypes we observe. They also point to a potential role that PIE1 plays in coordinating distinct defense signaling pathways, especially in the SA-JA antagonism.. . . SWC6 Is Epistatic to ARP6. Our analyses revealed that mutants of the SWR1c components show considerable differences in physiological and molecular phenotypes, leading to the assumption that the complex components may be functionally specialized. It is also likely that the non-enzymatic subunits might not necessarily be essential for complex function, and their depletion or inclusion in the complex could modulate its function. The components could also have functions independent of H2A.Z incorporation. To further elucidate the possible specialization and to understand their role in relation to each other, we analyzed double mutant plants. Since arp6 and swc6 mutants show similar morphological and developmental phenotypes but contrasting immunity traits, we analyzed arp6 swc6 double mutants to study disease resistance without the confounding effects of contrasting developmental phenotypes. The double mutants did not show any noticeable additional morphological phenotypes than the single mutants suggesting overlapping functions in development. As shown above, arp6 showed resistance to DC3000 while the swc6 mutant showed increased susceptibility compared with wild-type Col-0. Interestingly, the arp6 swc6 double mutants displayed increased susceptibility to Pst DC3000 phenocopying swc6(Figure 7). These results indicate that SWC6 is epistatic to ARP6 in disease-resistance traits. Despite the overlapping functions in development, it seems thatloss of SWC6 significantly compromises the regulation of immunity genes by SWR1c more than the loss of ARP6.. . . SWR1c Mutants Show Compromised Defense Gene Induction in Response to Pseudomonas. Our gene expression analyses have shown that genes involved in systemic acquired resistance such as PR1 and PR5 were derepressed in the SWR1c mutants and therefore showed increased basal expression (Figure5). Interestingly, however, pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 mutants were severely compromised in resistance to both virulent and avirulent P.syringae strains in spite of the enhanced basal expression of defense genes. To understand the molecular basis for these paradoxical phenotypes, we analyzed defense gene expression in the mutants in response to Pst DC3000. Gene expression was analyzed in 4-week-old wild-type Col-0 and the mutants by quantitative RT-PCR 6 h post inoculation with Pst DC3000 or mock treatment (10mM MgCl2) (Figure8). As expected, PR1 showed very low basal expression in Col-0 under control conditions, whereas bacterial infection resulted in a strong induction of gene expression (Figure8A). The arp6 mutant showed derepression of PR1and a stronger induction in response to Pst DC3000. On the other hand, the pie1 mutant showed a strong constitutive expression of PR1; however, inoculation with Pst DC3000 inoculation resulted in strong downregulation (Figure8A). In swc6 and hta9 hta11, where basal expression of PR1 was modestly altered, DC3000 infection resulted in its repression (Figure8A). Similarly, analysis of PR5 expression showed that while it was strongly induced in arp6 in response to Pst DC3000, there was little or no induction in pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 mutants (Figure8B). These results show that induction of PR1 and PR5 was compromised upon pathogen inoculation in pie1, swc6, and hta9 hta11 mutants despite the higher basal expression. Together, these results show that while it is required to maintain defense genes in repressed state in the absence of pathogen signals, SWR1c function, and therefore H2A.Z are essential for strong pathogen-induced defense gene activation that is essential for disease resistance..
PMC5174092	Results. . Selection of T-DNA Mutant Lines for Gravitropism Assay. To analyze the role of myosins in gravity response of the inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis, we performed a gravitropism assay on myosin single, double, triple, and quadruple mutant lines. First, we analyzed myosin mRNA content of each homozygous T-DNA mutant line by reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Only single mutant lines where RT-qPCR showed the most down-regulation of expression were selected for gravitropism assay: viii1(1), viii2, viiia(1), viiib(1), xi1(1), xi2(1), xia, xib, xic, xid, xif, xig, xih, xii, xij, and xik(1). The only exception was xie for which no downregulated allele was found (Figure 1). Because double mutants xi1 xi2, xi1 xik, xi2 xik, xih xik, triple mutants xi1 xi2 xik and xi2 xik xih and quadruple mutant viii1 viii2 viiia viiib were made previously using different single mutant lines, the expression levels of myosins in these lines were also measured and confirmed to be reduced in mutants viii1, viiib, and xik and increased in xi1 and xi2 (Figure 1).. . FIGURE 1. . Myosin mRNA levels in T-DNA mutant lines used in this study. RT-qPCR analysis of myosin mRNA levels in myosin T-DNA mutants relative to wild type (wt) control (set to 1).

For gravitropism assay, inflorescence stems were placed horizontally and gravitropic response was characterized by gravitropic curvature and relative average speed. All stems of single mutants, double mutants, triple mutant xi2 xik xih and quadruple mutant viii1 viii2 viiia viiib bent up to the same extent as wild type stems (Figures 2A-G and data not shown) and at an average speed comparable to that of wild type (Figure 3). The gravitropic response of xi1 xi2 xik was dramatically different resulting in delay of bending and shallower curvature compared to wild type (Figures 2H,I). While stems of wild type started to curve up within 30 min, continued bending and reached near vertical steady state, the stems of xi1 xi2 xik started to curve up only within 130 min and did not reach the maximum curvature value of the wild type even after 10 h of gravistimulation (Figure 2H). The average translocation speed in triple mutant was fourfold less than that in the wild type (Figure 3B). These results showed clearly that class XI but not class VIII myosins are required for stem gravitropism.. . FIGURE 2. .

The expression of myosins in wild type inflorescence stems gravistimulated for 4 h compared to non-gravistimulated wild type stems was also analyzed.

Delayed and insufficient gravitropic response of xi1 xi2 xik implied that the physical features of the stem might be impaired. For analysis of stem morphology, we made cross sections and longitudinal sections of the stems gravisensitive region and found that radial cell organization of triple mutant was not different from that of the wild type. Inflorescence stems had one epidermal cell layer, three or four cortex layers, and one endodermal cell layer (Figure 5).. . FIGURE 5. . Morphology of wild type and xi1 xi2 xik gravisensitive region.

As gravitropism requires organ growth and triple mutant has been shown to have shorter inflorescence stems than wild type (Peremyslov et al., 2010; Ojangu et al., 2012), we measured the elongation rates of stems during our 10-h gravitropism experiments and found it to be about 50% of that of wild type in triple mutant (Figure 6A). Next we performed flexure test for measuring stiffness of gravisensitive region. In flexure test we calculated flexural modulus of elasticity which shows the stiffness of the stems at the load applied. Compared to the wild type, xi1 xi2 xik had a 28% increase in bending stiffness and slightly reduced diameter (Figures 6B,C). These results suggest that myosins XI1, XI2, and XIK play a role in growth and rigidity formation of the inflorescence stem that likely affect gravitropic bending.. . FIGURE 6. .

Organization of Actin Filaments in xi1 xi2 xik Endodermal Cells is Not Altered. It is known that epidermal cells of triple mutant xi1 xi2 xik have alterations in the architecture of actin filaments (Peremyslov et al., 2010; Ueda et al., 2010; Cai et al., 2014). Therefore we analyzed F-actin organization in living endodermal cells expressing GFP-fABD-GFP (actin-binding domain 2 from Arabidopsis fimbrin 1) F-actin marker in the wild type and xi1 xi2 xik stems. Confocal microscopy revealed extensive network of actin filament bundles in both wild type and triple mutant endodermal cells without any apparent differences in their organization (Figure 7A). To analyze F-actin organization quantitatively, we measured average angles against the longitudinal axis of the cell and parallelness relative to each other by methods described by Ueda et al. (2010). The results of quantification confirmed that there was no significant difference between the average angles and parallelness (p = 0.4 and p = 0.9, respectively) of GFP-fABD-GFP-labeled actin filaments of triple mutant and wild type (Figures 7B,C).. .

Stem segments from gravisensitive region were fixed with the direction of gravity maintained constant, sectioned longitudinally and stained with IKI solution. Amyloplasts stained intensely both in wild type and xi1 xi2 xik genetic backgrounds indicating that there is no significant difference in the level of starch in amyloplasts. All amyloplasts in wild type and triple mutant control stems located at the bottom side of the cell (Figure 8A). Next, we investigated the sedimentation of amyloplasts in the direction of a new gravity vector. Inflorescence stems were gravistimulated for 10, 20, and 40 min by turning stems upside down. After 10 min of reorientation, amyloplasts in wild type stems were localized all over endodermal cell, some of them settling toward the new bottom (Figure 8B). Amyloplasts sedimented fully at the bottom of new basal end within 20 min (Figure 8C). In contrast, no movement of xi1 xi2 xik amyloplasts occurred during the first 10 min of reorientation (Figure 8B). First signs of sedimentation were visible by the end of 20 min but most of the amyloplasts still remained in their initial positions (Figure 8C) relocating to the new basal end only within 40 min (Figure 8D). These results demonstrate that myosins XI1, XI2, and XIK are also required for the proper sedimentation of amyloplasts.. . FIGURE 8. . Amyloplast distribution in endodermal cells.

Despite of the general functional redundancy of the highly expressed myosins XI, it is known that the myosin XIK plays principal roles in such myosin-dependent processes as intracellular trafficking, cell expansion and plant growth (Ojangu et al., 2007, 2012; Peremyslov et al., 2008, 2010, 2012; Avisar et al., 2012; Park and Nebenfhr, 2013). Accordingly, we attempted to address this myosins contribution to gravitropism using inflorescence stems of xi1 xi2 xik triple mutant stably transformed to express a genomic copy of the myosin XIK gene tagged with YFP (Peremyslov et al., 2012). Strikingly, the stems of plants with the xi1 xi2 xik XIK:YFP genetic background exhibited normal gravitropic response. There was no delay in the gravitropic response of transgenic stems and the curvature was comparable to that of the wild type (Figure 9A). Furthermore, the relative average speed of stem movement increased from 26% of that in the wild type in the xi1 xi2 xik, to 86% in the xi1 xi2 xik XIK:YFP (Figure 9B) being not significantly different from that of the wild type (p = 0.5). We then investigated the sedimentation of amyloplasts in xi1 xi2 xik XIK:YFP, inverting the stems upside down similarly to xi1 xi2 xik (Figure 8). It was found that translocation of amyloplasts was improved-although 10 min after reorientation amyloplasts in xi1 xi2 xik XIK:YFP did not move at the same extent as in wild type, the translocation was massive after 20 min (Figure 9C). Thus, the expression of XIK:YFP resulted in genetic rescue of the triple mutant gravitropic bending and amyloplast sedimentation.. . FIGURE 9. .

PMC3527283	Results. . Delineation of Deletion Breakpoints and Analyses of Sequence Junctions. Our previous work documented that five different brevipedicellus alleles were not simple alterations in the gene sequence, but rather were due to large deletions of at least 150 kbp [8]. Information on all reported bp alleles can be found in Table S1. The original bp-1 mutant, isolated by Koornneef and coworkers [10], was generated by EMS mutagenesis, an alkylating agent that typically induces G to A transition mutations. We identified the bp-2 and bp-3 mutants from a fast neutron mutagenized population; bp-5 is the result of an aberrant T-DNA insertion, and bp-11 is an x-ray induced mutant. All five of these alleles exhibit large deletions. The other characterized bp mutants appear to be simple base changes induced by EMS (bp-4, 6-8, and 10), or are insertional mutants (bp-9). Lastly, Venglat et al. [11] reported the isolation of a bp-2 mutant from a promoter tagged population; this mutant was later characterized as a point mutation.. Delineation of the boundaries of these deletion alleles would permit an analysis of breakpoint regions and perhaps provide clues as to why the region appears to be prone to such extreme segmental deletion events. We therefore employed a six-phase strategy to determine the breakpoints of the five deletions, followed by in-silico analyses to search for motifs that might be important determinants of either generating the deletion or limiting the extent of the lesion. First, for each allele, at least one breakpoint was generally localized by employing PCR, using sets of primers that span a region of approximately 1.2 Mbp. The absence of a PCR amplification product was interpreted to mean that the region was part of the deletion (Figure 1). Next, DNA gel blotting was employed to find a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) between the mutant and parental (either Columbia or Ler) DNA. In phase 3, mutant DNA was cleaved with the enzyme identified by RFLP analysis and the DNA was ligated under conditions designed to produce intramolecular events, generating circular products. This DNA was used as a template for inverse PCR (iPCR) to amplify sequences adjacent to known DNA, including the repaired breakpoints. DNA sequencing was then employed to determine the breakpoint junction sequences. Based on this information, new primers were designed to amplify mutant DNA across the breakpoints to give rise to products of predicted size and sequence and thus validate the deletion (phase 5 analysis). Lastly, computer algorithms were employed to analyze the breakpoint junctions, to search for common features/motifs.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003136.g001. Figure 1. . Localization of bp allele breakpoints by PCR.. DNA from Columbia (C), Landsberg erecta (L), and bp alleles, bp-1, 2, 3, 5 and 11 (designated 0) were amplified with primer sets spanning approximately 1.2 Mbp of chromosome 4. Note that Ler DNA is polymorphic for some loci, leading to either no amplification or to products of a different size than found for Columbia (AFLPs). For the bp alleles the absence of a PCR product is interpreted as representing a deletion of that region of the genome. Primer information and data for additional primer sets that punctuate those shown in the figure can be consulted in Table S2.. . . . . Table 1 summarizes the five bp deletion alleles. Sequencing of iPCR products revealed that both bp-1 and bp-2 north junction sequences are composed of highly repeated sequences that are found predominantly in centromeric regions on all five chromosomes. For bp-1, the breakpoint occurs within a tandem (AG)n motif that is broadly distributed and may be a member of the LIMPET transposon family [12]. The north junction sequence could not be unequivocally localized for the following reasons. First, we found that a substantial number of primer sets, spanning BACs F5K24, F10A2, T3E15, and F28D6, did not give rise to PCR products with Landsberg erecta DNA templates (and therefore were PCR negative for all bp alleles in an Ler background; see Tables S2, S3, S4 for primer sequences, locations and amplicon status). Other primer sets generated AFLPs wherein the PCR product size differed between Ler and Col, but which can be useful tools for map-based cloning (e.g. primer sets 76/77 and T3E15-2 in Figure 1). Second, sequencing of iPCR products revealed that the junction sequence adjacent to the south bp-1 breakpoint is most similar to sequences found on other chromosomes, particularly chromosomes 1 and 3. Intriguingly, the percent match for all of these sequences is only 80-91%. The best matches on chromosome 4 include a sequence near 1 Mb, which could be interpreted as an inversion involving the centromere. Additionally there is homology to a region centered at about 4.3 Mb that has a polarity opposite that expected from sequencing the iPCR product. Subsequent pachytene chromosome in situ hybridization discounted the first possibility as cytological landmarks and the distances between fluorescent probe signals are normally distributed in bp-1 (see below). Although a complex rearrangement may be involved, it is more likely that sequence divergence between the Columbia and Landsberg erecta genomes is responsible for this disparity. Based on the locations of the primer sets, bp-1 has suffered a deletion of at least 400.6 kbp (south breakpoint to primer set F1K3) and possibly as much as 900 kbp (south breakpoint to homologous region at 4.3 Mb).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003136.t001.

The bp-2 south breakpoint is located 13.7 kbp south of the BP gene, within the third intron of At4g01870, encoding a putative IP3 kinase. The sequence north of this breakpoint exhibits significant homology to a centromeric satellite sequence that is highly repeated on all chromosomes. The best match on chromosome 4 is to BAC F13J5 (94%), followed by the adjacent BAC, F15N16 (93%). It is noteworthy that the bp-2 allele, also in the Ler background, is PCR positive for three primer sets within BACs T3E15, F28D6 and F14G16, all of which are south of F15N16 according to the AGI reference sequence. The simplest explanation of these data is that either Columbia or Ler has suffered an inversion that positions the F13J5 and F15N16 sequences closer to the BP locus. Additionally or alternatively, sequence divergence between the centromeric satellites in Col vs. Ler might account for the less than perfect sequence homology we found. As is the case for bp-1, the repetitive nature of the bp-2 flanking sequence prohibits a phase 5 PCR analysis to amplify across the breakpoints and thus the extent of the bp-2 deletion cannot be unequivocally known. However, with the Columbia BAC tiling path as a reference, the deletion in bp-2 is at least 851 kbp based on the localized south breakpoint at AGI coordinate 5164664, and the first PCR positive fragment on the north end (in BAC T3E15 centering at 4.3 Mbp).. The locations of both junctions for bp-3, bp-5 and bp-11 were unequivocally determined. bp-3, another fast neutron generated allele, suffered a precise deletion of 386,634 bp, with a single guanosine residue inserted between the two breakpoints. bp-5, which presumably arose due to an aberrant T-DNA integration event, suffered a 140,996 bp deletion, but possesses a 19 bp filler sequence (5 TCCATGTAGTAAGGTAATT3) at the junction that is 90% identical to a sequence on chromosome 3. The phase 5 PCR product sequence validates the deletion boundaries and the foreign insertion sequence, but its origin is unknown. Lastly, bp-11 is an x-ray induced allele in which the precise excision of 925,158 bp occurred.. . . FISH Analyses Confirm Cytological Landmarks and Reveal Large-Scale Ecotype-Specific Chromosome Polymorphisms. To provide complementary data on the breakpoint locations determined by our molecular analyses, and to investigate the extent of the deletions in bp-1 and bp-2, we coupled cytological analyses with pachytene chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using five probesets that span chromosome 4 from 0.7 Mbp to 6.4 Mbp (Figure 2). In Columbia, an inversion event involving pericentric heterochromatin has resulted in a heterochromatic knob in this ecotype, which has no counterpart in Ler. [13], [14]. Cytological examination of DAPI stained chromosomes enabled us to measure distances between the NOR4 ribosomal gene cluster at the north end and other cytological landmarks: the heterochromatic knob (hk4S, in Columbia backgrounds), and CEN4 (Table 2). In addition, the size of hk4S and CEN4 could be evaluated. These analyses revealed that the distance from NOR4 to CEN4 and the size of CEN4 are approximately equal in both parental lines and in all bp alleles. In the Columbia based alleles, the size of hk4S is also similar to the wildtype parent line, as was expected.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003136.g002. Figure 2. . Chromosomal landscapes for Columbia, Landsberg erecta, and the bp alleles reveal ecotype specific and allele specific differences.. A.

The figure is drawn to scale, with the exceptions that NOR4 and CEN4 are only allotted 1000 bp in the AGI numbering scheme.

The probesets for FISH were chosen to evaluate distances between distinct cytological landmarks and the probe target sequences. The two rhodamine-associated probesets RED1 and RED2 bracket hk4S in Columbia (Figure 2a) and measurements of NOR4 to RED1 revealed no significant differences in either of the two parental ecotypes, or in the bp alleles. As expected, due to the pericentric inversion in Columbia that generated hk4S, the RED1 to RED2 interval is smaller in Columbia than in Ler, and the distances for the bp alleles are similar to their parent ecotypes. We conclude that the bp-associated deletions do not involve chromatin north of the centromere. In this regard, the possibility that the bp-1 north junction sequence, which exhibits homology to the 1 Mbp region suggestive of an inversion involving the centromere, can be ruled out in favor of an event occurring south of the centromere in a region that has diverged between Columbia and Ler.. To correlate the size of the deletions with cytological measurements, three additional probesets were employed. GREEN 1 sequences are located very near CEN4 at 4.3 Mbp, while two additional GREEN probes bind in the 6-6.4 Mbp region, south of the BP locus at 5.15 Mbp (Figure 2). We expected that the extent of the deletions, as gauged by molecular analyses and sequence comparisons, could be roughly correlated with changes in the distance between GREEN1 and GREEN2 (G1/G2). Indeed, this is the general trend we observed as bp-5 (141 Kbp) and bp-11 (925 Kbp) deletions gave intersignal distances of 2.1 m and 1.7 m, respectively, compared to the wildtype Columbia distance of 2.7 m. For the Ler-based alleles bp-1 and bp-2, for which the north breakpoints could not be established, we observed similar reductions in signal distances compared to the Ler parental background with bp-2 exhibiting a shorter G1/G2 length, and thus a larger deletion, than bp-1.. To our surprise, we found that the G1/G2 distance in Columbia is markedly different from Ler, being on average about 2.7 m in Columbia, but over 5 m for Ler. These measurements were reproducible and statistically significant, implying that a major polymorphism exists between these two ecotypes. Because the RED2 to GREEN1 distances do not vary significantly between Col and Ler and because GREEN1 localizes very close to the DAPI stained centromere in both ecotypes, it seems likely that the G1/G2 polymorphism is due to an indel occurring between them, or possibly an inversion that moved the G2/G3 probeset sequences in a manner similar to the event that created hk4S. The latter possibility might be resolved by using different colored G2/G3 probes in future experiments.. . . Bioinformatic Analyses of Breakpoint Regions. Simple BLASTn searches coupled with gene annotations available through the TAIR database permit the identification of genetic elements at breakpoint regions. As the bp deletions are found in the pericentromeric region, there are many occurrences of transposons, pseudogenes, and repetitive sequences. Some of these may be expressed, based on annotated cDNAs and/or expressed sequence tags that map to these sequences, but due to their repetitive nature, it is not clear if they are the actively expressed copies. Discounting transposon/repeat-associated sequences, in the region of 4.2 Mbp to 5.25 Mbp, there are 31 annotation units for which cDNA/EST annotations exist, and another 16 predicted genes for which there are no cDNA/EST sequences. The largest deletion, bp-11, which spans over 925 kbp, has lost 27 genes, while bp-5, the shortest deletion allele spanning 141 kbp, is missing 10 genes (see Table S5). Within the set of 31 genes, there are two pseudogenes, nine that encode unknown proteins, and three that encode proteins with conserved domains of unknown function. Genes with more complete annotations are mostly members of gene families, though a few are single copy genes. Under normal growth conditions, the Ler based alleles are indistinguishable from one another, and the Columbia based alleles are also similar to one another. It must be appreciated that the bp phenotype is enhanced in the Ler background due to the absence of the ERECTA protein kinase [9]. Our initial work with bp-2 demonstrated that the bp mutant phenotype can be rescued by transformation with a wildtype gene [8]; thus under normal growth conditions, the deleted genes seem to be dispensable.. A suite of bioinformatics algorithms (BLAST, MEME, RepeatMasker) was used to interrogate the breakpoint sequences to discover commonalities that might inform our understanding of how the lesions were generated/repaired. Our strategy was to analyze north and south donor sequences. A north donor consists of 1 kbp of DNA north of the north breakpoint linked to 1 kbp of adjacent DNA that was deleted. Similarly, a south donor consists of 1 kbp of DNA that was deleted adjacent to 1 kbp of DNA south of the south breakpoints. As the breakpoint regions lie in the pericentromeric chromatin, most of the breakpoint donor sequences were found to possess one or more known repeats and/or transposon remnants (Figure 3). There is no common sequence motif shared by all alleles, but several short repeats of 20-50 nucleotides (motifs 1-5, see also Figure S1 for alignments and their p-values) are conserved in three to four alleles. The north flanking sequences are predominated by satellite (bp-2), Athila/gypsy transposons (bp-3, bp-5, bp-11) or LIMPET elements (bp-1), most of which are abundant and dispersed throughout the pericentromeric region. The south flanking regions, which cluster within 80 kbp of each other in BAC T12G13, tend to be sparse in repetitive sequences, but are A/T rich and 80% possess motif 5, a T-rich element that is also found in two of the north flanking regions. Statistically, the p-values for motifs 1-5 range from 2.810-22 to 510-6, lending credibility to their association with lesion formation and/or repair.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003136.g003. Figure 3. . Bioinformatic analysis of bp alleles.. One kilobase of flanking sequence north and south of the breakpoint is represented. Above each line is a summary of Repeatmasker analysis that identified common repetitive elements and low complexity regions. A/T represents an adenine/thymine rich region, while A/G represents an adenine/guanine repeat. The A/T content is graphed below the boxes with the solid line positioned at the 75% threshold for a window size of 50. Below each line is a summary of MEME analysis, which identified common sequences represented as colored boxes (motifs 1-5). The orientation of these repeats is given by the arrows within the boxes. Figure S1 shows the MEME sequence alignments and their p-values. The locations of predicted MARS binding sites are shown as labeled blue lines.. . . . Sequences at the breakpoints offer little evidence of homologous recombination. Although both the north and south flanking regions of bp-1 contain sequences with homology to LIMPET elements, the junctions are not a continuous sequence in the repaired product, which argues against homologous recombination. A simplistic explanation for this lesion is that it results from illegitimate recombination between (AG)n rich repeat sequences located at approximately 4.2 and 5.2 Mbp, but the significance of the flanking LIMPET sequences cannot be evaluated. Additionally, the close proximity of a (CT)n rich sequence juxtaposes two complementary sequences that could generate a long hairpin structure with the breakpoint occurring in a loop of four nucleotides at its apex. Complex secondary structures are predicted at or near all of the donor sequences, with the exception of bp-1 (see Figure S2).. The apparent lack of homology between the paired north and south flanking sequences indicates that the DNA damage is likely repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In only one instance (bp-5) is there microhomology between the 5 and 3 donor sequence junctions, which might portend the involvement of microhomology-mediated recombination.. . . Breakpoint Junctions Associate with a Nuclear Matrix Protein In Vitro. Matrix attachment region (MAR) prediction algorithms suggested the possibility that some of the sequences near the breakpoint junctions contain binding sites for the nuclear matrix. There are several known components of the nuclear matrix, including AHL1, an AT hook domain containing protein that has been shown by biochemical and cytological assays to be associated with the nuclear matrix [15]. We cloned an AHL1 cDNA behind an inducible promoter and expressed it as a His-tagged protein in E. coli. Southwestern blot analysis was then undertaken with end-labeled probes, including a positive control (a plastocyanin gene, PC, [16]), a negative control (a histone H1 gene fragment, At1g06760) and several fragments near the breakpoint junctions (2S, 3N, 3S, 5S, 5N, and 11S). Figure 4 shows that the histone H1 probe does not bind to the AHL1 protein. The positive control PC1 probe as well as the 2S, 3N and 5N probes bound weakly, but above background levels, while the 3S, 5S and 11S probes exhibited strong binding to AHL1. We conclude that these probes, representing regions predicted to contain MAR binding sites, do indeed bind to a known matrix associated protein. Intriguingly, the 3S, 5S and 11S probes are located within 26 kbp of each other at the south end of BAC T12G13, which harbors all of the south end deletion breakpoints. It is conceivable that BAC T12G13 contains sequences that organize chromatin loops and that in the bp deletion mutants, resection of the initial lesions is limited by either a complex chromatin structure (e.g. boundary element possessing extensive secondary structure) and/or an attachment point on the nuclear matrix.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003136.g004. Figure 4. . Breakpoint junction regions bind the nuclear matrix protein AHL1.. Aliquots of proteins from induced E. coli harboring HIS-tagged AHL1 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting, and membrane strips were probed with end labeled DNA fragments. 2S, 3N, 3S, 5N, 11S represent probes near the north or south (N or S) borders of the breakpoints of each bp allele as shown on the accompanying map with AGI coordinates in Mbp. PC represents a positive control from the plastocyanin gene [16] while H1 represents the histone H1 gene (At1g06760) probe, used as a negative control. The locations of the BP gene and BAC T12G13 are shown.. . . . . . Crossover Frequency and Genome Polymorphisms Are Indexed by the Bp Breakpoints. The lack of an ordered array of large clones of Ler DNA precludes both direct Col/Ler synteny comparisons as well as the construction of genome array chips for chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Nevertheless, as two of our bp alleles are derived from Columbia, we suspected that data mining might prove fruitful for correlating the breakpoint regions with established chromatin features and genetic data. We reasoned that segments of the genome that are active in recombination might have features that could predispose them for rearrangement events. High-resolution recombination mapping along chromosome 4 revealed very little recombination in the hk4S and CEN4 regions, as expected, but also identified regions which exhibit high levels of recombination (hotspots, [17]). Figure 5 shows that the 5-6 Mbp region is very active in recombination, with one of the hotspots in the same region where the south breakpoints of all bp alleles cluster. Interestingly, this region also includes the HY4 locus, where multiple large deletion alleles have been reported [18].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003136.g005. Figure 5. . Colocalization of breakpoints with recombination hotspots and chromosome rearrangement events.. A. Recombination frequency (in cM/Mbp) along chromosome 4, recharted from data of Drouaud et al [17].

Locations of gross chromosomal fusion and rearrangement events in Arabidopsis progenitors that gave rise to A. lyrata and A. thaliana. The locations of A. lyrata chromosomes 6 (red) and 7 (green) segments are depicted as the colored arrows [6]. The direction of the arrows indicates the polarity of rearranged segments. Not all fusions/inversions are shown. Note the general correlation between CO frequency, the cluster of bp south breakpoint deletions (SBC), and the location of chromosome rearrangements. The HY4 arrow points to a region around 5.7 Mbp where numerous HY4 deletion mutants exist (see the Discussion and [18]). C. High resolution sequence comparison of A. lyrata chromosome 6 (top) and A. thaliana chromosome 4 (bottom) in the pericentric region where BP and HY4 are located. Three A. lyrata genome segments are shown along with their lengths and are color coded. The corresponding A. thaliana regions are shorter and ancestral rearrangement events have repositioned the BP/HY4 loci relative to the progenitor genome. The red hatched lines and segment polarity arrows indicate colinearity/synteny between the two genome segments, while the black hatched lines highlight a putative inversion/transposition event(s) involving the brown colored segments. In addition to the rearrangement events, note that significantly more DNA exists in this region in A. lyrata relative to A. thaliana, implying that additional remodeling events have also occurred. Sequences to the left of each chromosome represent pericentromeric DNA that cannot be accurately aligned due to the repetitive nature of the region.. . . . . A. thaliana and A. lyrata likely evolved from a common ancestor and several chromosomal fusion and rearrangement events have occurred to reduce both the size of the genome and the number of linkage groups in A. thaliana. [6], [7]. Comparisons of the genomic sequences of the two species reveal that several regions of the ancestral chromosomes six and seven were fused to generate A. thaliana chromosome 4 [6], [7 and references therein]. Importantly, some of the major rearrangement events also map to the region where the south breakpoints are clustered and in other areas, for example in the 16-17 Mbp region where other rearrangement events have occurred, recombination hotspots also exist (Figure 5B). Comparative sequence analysis of the BP/HY4 region of the A. thaliana and A. lyrata genomes indicate that one or more segments of these genomes underwent transposition/inversion events, providing additional evidence that the region is recombinogenic and prone to chromosome rearrangement events that are possibly associated with speciation (Figure 5C).. Epigenomic data mining revealed that the defined north end breakpoints (bp-3, bp-5 and bp-11) possess common histone modifications, specifically H3K27me1, H3K9me2 and H4K20me1, and in addition exhibit 5-15% 5-methylcytosine (Figure 6, see also Figure S3). This combination of chromatin modifications is associated with transposable element rich regions found in pericentric heterochromatin [19]. The south end breakpoints, with the exception of bp-1, differ markedly from the north ends, sharing no chromatin marks and exhibiting very low levels of 5-methylcytosine. The bp-2 south breakpoint, located within an expressed gene, contains ubiquitinated H2B, H3K27me3 and H3K4me2, all typically associated with euchromatin [19]. The other clustered south breakpoints contain either of the two latter modifications (bp-5, bp-11), but are generally devoid of chromatin marks. However, the local regions possess a variety of modifications and the four basic chromatin states [19] are interspersed (see Figure S3). It is conceivable that a particular combination of chromatin modifications may promote genome instability, or, as we observed for the clustered south breakpoints, a dearth of chromatin modifications and lack of 5-methylcytosine may be indicative of a chromatin state that underpins genomic instability/recombinogenic potential. In any event, features inherent to BAC T12G13 represent a boundary element or transition zone in which the chromatin state switches from one bearing heterochromatic marks to one indicative of a more euchromatic state (Figure 6B).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003136.g006. Figure 6. . Chromatin modifications at the breakpoint junctions.. A. North breakpoints occur in pericentric heterochromatin and bear H3K9me2, H4K20me1 and H3K27me1 signatures.

The BP/HY4 Region Is Unstable Relative to Many Other Loci. The large deletions that we document for the BP locus, as well as the close proximity of the HY4 locus where numerous large deletions have also been reported [18], encourages speculation that the region is generally unstable and prone to deletions and other gross chromosomal rearrangement events. We therefore examined literature reports and employed mutant germplasm search engines to catalog the locations of deletions greater than 25 bp to ascertain if the BP/HY4 region is overrepresented in this data set. Figure S4 shows that the 5 bp alleles and the 15 hy4 alleles reported by Bruggemann and coworkers [18], constitute 20 of the 120 deletion mutations associated with structural genes. We conclude that the BP/HY4 region is on average more prone to deletion/rearrangement events than most other regions of the genome..
PMC2973837	Results. . A mutation in SRFR1 in Col-0 causes abnormal growth. We previously had isolated the mutant alleles srfr1-1 and srfr1-2 from the Arabidopsis accession RLD [15]. Apart from enhanced resistance to DC3000(avrRps4), they did not display marked phenotypes. To further investigate the function of SRFR1, we aimed at isolating T-DNA tagged lines of SRFR1 in the accession Col-0 [20], [21]. Out of four lines, one did not germinate (SALK_106212), and one was untagged (SALK_095440). We could verify a T-DNA insertion far upstream of the open reading frame in SALK_039199, without causing an apparent phenotype. Interestingly, the fourth line, SAIL_412_E08 with a T-DNA insertion in the second intron of SRFR1 (Figure 1A), showed pronounced stunting (Figure 1B) in one-fourth of plants (22 out of 97 plants; chi2=0.28). Genotyping showed that the T-DNA insertion in SRFR1 segregated in the original seed stock, and that stunted plants were invariably homozygous for the T-DNA insertion. Reverse transcription (RT) PCR showed that no srfr1 mRNA was detected with primers on either side of the insertion (Figure S1). A low level of srfr1 mRNA could be detected with primers located 3 of the T-DNA insertion, but this mRNA contained the T-DNA (Figure S1), indicating that srfr1-4 mRNA does not encode functional protein. Consistent with this, Li and co-workers recently showed that no SRFR1 protein can be detected in this knock-out line [22]. We named this line srfr1-4.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.g001. Figure 1. . A mutation in SRFR1 causes severe stunting in Col-0.. (A) Schematic gene structure of SRFR1 (At4g37460), with exons shown as boxes and introns as lines. The T-DNA insertion site in the second intron in srfr1-4 (SAIL_412_E08) is indicated. (B) Growth phenotype of srfr1-4 and complementation with a genomic copy of SRFR1 in transgenic plants.. . . . Subsequently, we back-crossed srfr1-4 to Col-0. The stunted phenotype co-segregated with homozygosity of the srfr1-4 T-DNA tagged allele in F2 plants (Table 1). To prove that the phenotype originated from the srfr1-4 allele, we transformed healthy heterozygous srfr1-4 plants with pSHK102 containing a genomic clone of SRFR1 [18], and by scoring for antibiotic resistance selected 5 single-locus homozygous transgenic SRFR1 T3 lines that contained at least one copy of the srfr1-4 T-DNA allele based on genotyping. Because the transgenic copy of SRFR1 prevented us from determining whether these T3 lines were homozygous or heterozygous for the srfr1-4 allele, we tested whether srfr1-4 segregated in the next generation by genotyping 15 progeny for each line. Three of the 5 lines were shown in this way to be homozygous for the srfr1-4 allele, and the transgenic copy of SRFR1 reversed the stunted phenotype in each case (Figure 1B). We concluded that the stunted growth phenotype is caused by the T-DNA insertion in SRFR1.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.t001. Table 1. .

The stunted srfr1-4 phenotype was in marked contrast to the normal phenotype of srfr1-1 and srfr1-2 plants. To determine whether the specific allele of SRFR1 or the Col-0 genetic background causes the severe phenotype of srfr1-4, we first reexamined more closely F3 families of important break-point plants retained from the SRFR1 mapping populations. Plants in these F3 families were generated by crossing srfr1-1 or srfr1-2 (RLD background) to the SAIL RPS4 T-DNA knockout line rps4-1 (Col-0 background) [15], [18] and were progeny of F2 plants selected for resistance to DC3000(avrRps4). They were therefore homozygous for srfr1-1 or srfr1-2, with varying degrees of Col-0 background. Two out of 4 srfr1-1 and 2 out of 6 srfr1-2 F3 families contained no individuals with abnormal growth phenotypes. However, the remaining F3 families gave rise to plants with phenotypes similar to srfr1-4. The combined total number of stunted plants in these families was 20 out of 107 plants, consistent with the segregation of a single recessive gene in these populations (chi2=2.43, P>0.1). We concluded that most likely the mutant alleles srfr1-1 and srfr1-2 also induce stunting in the Col-0 background and that Col-0 possesses a recessive genetic modifier that alters the srfr1 phenotype.. We tested these predictions directly by out-crossing srfr1-4 to RLD and srfr1-1. In the cross to srfr1-1, 14 out of 46 plants were stunted, consistent with both srfr1-1 and srfr1-4 causing stunting and the segregation of a recessive gene (chi2=0.45, P>0.5). In the cross to RLD, segregation of the stunted phenotype in the F2 generation was explained by two recessive genes, and genotyping showed that while all stunted plants were homozygous srfr1-4, not all srfr1-4/srfr1-4 plants were automatically stunted (Table 2). In this cross, stunted F2 plants were also selected to determine a rough map position for the presumptive Col-0 modifier gene. This mapping placed the Col-0 modifier gene onto chromosome 4 (Table 3). Interestingly, in addition to the bottom of chromosome 4 where SRFR1 is located, individual break-point plants identified a map position towards the top of chromosome 4 between markers ciw6 and CH42 for the Col-0 modifier gene.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.t002.

The map position for the modifier gene contained the Col-0-specific TNL R gene homolog SNC1, which was originally identified through a point mutation that autoactivates the SNC1 protein and constitutively induces PR genes even in the npr1 mutant line [23]. Additional work showed that wild-type SNC1 is easily autoactivated when expression of SNC1 is misregulated [24]. For example, mutations in BON1, a member of the copine gene family encoding a plasma membrane-localized putative calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein [25], [26], lead to higher SNC1 expression levels, constitutive defense responses and reduced plant growth [27]. When the Col bon1-1 mutant was outcrossed to other Arabidopsis accessions, it was found that the wild-type SNC1 gene from Col-0 behaved as a recessive locus that causes stunting [27]. Our segregation data also indicated that the Col-0 modifier was recessive (Table 2). We therefore tested additional phenotypes displayed by bon1-1 plants, such as temperature dependence of constitutive defense activation and growth phenotypes. The stunted phenotype in srfr1-4 was severe at 22C, but was intermediate at 24C and absent at 28C (Figure 2A), reminiscent of the Arabidopsis bon1-1 mutant phenotype.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.g002. Figure 2. . The growth phenotype of srfr1-4 is temperature-dependent and accompanied by constitutive activation of defenses..

(B) The srfr1-4 mutation enhances both basal defenses and AvrRps4-triggered immunity in Col-0.

Two independent transgenic srfr1-4 lines complemented with a genomic copy of SRFR1 are shown. Values represent averages of cfu/cm2 leaf tissue from triplicate samples, and error bars denote standard deviation. Values labeled with different letters show significant differences as determined by Student's t-test (P<0.05, n=3) on day 3. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results. (C) Altered defense gene mRNA levels in srfr1-4 at 22C. Analysis of indicated transcripts in Col-0 and srfr1-4 by RT-PCR using 27 PCR cycles. ACTIN2 was used as an internal control.. . . . In srfr1-1 and srfr1-2 plants, resistance to DC3000(avrRps4) was enhanced, but remained unchanged to virulent DC3000, and plant growth was normal [15], [18]. Interestingly, the srfr1-4 mutants were resistant not only to avirulent DC3000(avrRps4), but also to virulent DC3000 and non-pathogenic DC3000 hrcC- (Figure 2B). The srfr1-4 line showed approximately 50-fold lower DC3000 and DC3000(avrRps4) growth than wild type Col-0, whereas the growth of DC3000 hrcC- in srfr1-4 was about 10-fold less than in Col-0, suggesting that mutations in SRFR1 in Col-0 increased basal defenses at 24C that were additive to AvrRps4-triggered immunity (Figure 2B). Complemented srfr1-4 lines did not show either enhanced resistance phenotype (Figure 2B). We could not test bacterial growth at 22C because srfr1-4 plants were severely stunted at this temperature. However, consistent with an upregulation of salicylic acid (SA)-based defenses, PR1 and PR2 mRNA levels were upregulated and PDF1.2 levels down-regulated in srfr1-4 at 22C (Figure 2C).. Characterization of the srfr1-4 phenotype and mapping therefore strongly suggested that the Col-0 modifier is SNC1. To test this directly, we crossed srfr1-4 to snc1-11, a T-DNA insertion allele in the first exon of SNC1 [27]. In the F2 population, the number of stunted plants was consistent with the segregation of two recessive loci (srfr1-4 and wild-type SNC1) (Table 4). All of the stunted plants were homozygous for the srfr1-4 allele and the wild-type SNC1 allele. In contrast, all plants of normal stature that were homozygous for the srfr1-4 T-DNA allele possessed at least one copy of the snc1-11 T-DNA allele (Table 4). Therefore, the stunted phenotype of srfr1-4 plants requires two copies of SNC1 in Col-0, analogous to the phenotype of bon1-1 plants [27]. We quantified the effect of mutations in SRFR1 on plant growth by measuring the shoot weight of srfr1 mutants in Col-0 and RLD (Figure 3). Shoot weights were close to normal in the original srfr1-1 and srfr1-2 plants compared to wild-type RLD. Mutations in srfr1 caused severe reductions in shoot weight in the Col-0 background that were completely reversed by introgressing snc1-11. Interestingly, the shoot weight of srfr1 SNC1 plants was more strongly reduced than in bon1-1 plants (Figure 3), indicating that perhaps SRFR1 functions downstream of additional R genes apart from regulating SNC1. Together with the negative regulation in AvrRps4- and HopA1-triggered immunity, these results show that SRFR1 is a negative regulator of plant immune responses of broader specificity than originally described.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.g003.

Previous studies had suggested that the readily autoactivatable SNC1 is limited to the Col-0 accession, but these studies had not included RLD [27]. We therefore sequenced the likely RLD ortholog of SNC1 in RLD to determine the molecular basis for the very different phenotypes of Col-0 and RLD srfr1 mutants. At the 5-end, SNC1-specific primers consistently amplified a sequence with high overall similarity to SNC1-Col (Figure 4A and 4B). SNC1-specific primers designed to amplify the complete SNC1 gene or the 3-half of SNC1 failed to result in a unique RLD product. This reflected the very duplicated nature of the 3-half of SNC1 in Col-0. Whole sections of the gene are not only duplicated within SNC1 with 100% sequence identity, but are also found in linked family members [28]. We were not able to experimentally determine unequivocally which genomic PCR product from the 3-end was physically linked to the 5-end of SNC1-RLD.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.g004. Figure 4. .

Characters in blue, red and green show the amino acids corresponding to exon 1, exon 2 and exon 3, respectively. (B) SNC1 gene model as experimentally verified by reverse transcription PCR and 3-RACE from Col-0 (middle) and RLD (bottom) compared with the TAIR9 gene model (top). Exons are indicated by boxes, introns by lines, and stop codons by red asterisks.. . . . We therefore determined the SNC1 mRNA sequence from RLD using a combination of 3-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (3-RACE) and RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 4A, the open reading frame of SNC1-RLD predicted a protein of 619 amino acids, including a TIR and NBS domain but only a partial LRR domain. The predicted amino acid sequence identity between SNC1-Col and SNC1-RLD within the first three exons was 87%. However, our SNC1-RLD cDNA sequence was missing the fourth and fifth exons, leading to an in-frame stop codon at position 620 (Figure 4B). Interestingly, in the SNC1-RLD cDNA the very 3-end of the open-reading frame and the 3-untranslated region showed high nucleotide sequence identity with the corresponding region in SNC1-Col. Because we only obtained cDNA sequence of SNC1-RLD at the 3-end, we could not determine whether the 3-end of the SNC1-RLD coding sequence is interrupted by introns. We also obtained RT-PCR products from Col-0. These indicated that in contrast to the annotation of SNC1 in TAIR, we did not find evidence for the splicing of intron 5, which does not contain in-frame stop codons (Figure 4B). This alternative SNC1 transcript encoded a SNC1 protein of 1404 amino acids rather than the annotated 1301 amino acids. Taken together, sequencing of the RLD SNC1 ortholog provided evidence for polymorphisms at the 5-end and major alterations in the 3-half of the gene compared to Col-0, consistent with the fact that RLD does not have a SNC1 ortholog that triggers stunted growth in the absence of SRFR1.. . . Morphologically normal srfr1-4 snc-11 double mutants possess primed defenses. Activation of SNC1, either by intragenic autoactivating mutations [23] or by mutations in negative regulators of SNC1 such as BON1 [27], leads to constitutively enhanced resistance. Consistent with this and the constitutive expression of PR genes in srfr1-4 (Figure 2C), we observed with in planta bacterial growth assays increased resistance of srfr1-4 to DC3000(avrRps4) and to virulent DC3000 (Figure 2B). The latter shows that srfr1-4 plants possess elevated basal resistance that is independent of particular avirulence genes. To test if enhanced basal resistance in srfr1-4, like stunted growth, is fully dependent on SNC1, we performed in planta bacterial growth assays at varying temperatures. As noted before, we were not able to infiltrate srfr1-4 plants at 22C because of the severe growth phenotype.. At both 22C and 24C, the growth of DC3000 and DC3000(avrRps4) was reduced in srfr1-4 snc1-11 compared to growth in wild type Col-0, even though the growth of DC3000(avrRps4) in srfr1-4 snc1-11 was slightly higher than that in srfr1-4 at 24C (Figure 5A and 5B). This remnant enhanced basal resistance in srfr1-4 snc1-11 plants may be related to the induced defense gene mRNA levels observed in RLD srfr1-1 and srfr1-2 plants, although the latter plants do not show enhanced basal resistance [18], [29]. These results demonstrate that although the stunted phenotype of srfr1-4 at 22C and 24C is fully mediated by SNC1, enhanced basal resistance at these temperatures in srfr1-4 is not entirely mediated by SNC1. At 28C, both basal and AvrRps4-triggered resistance were abolished in srfr1-4 and srfr1-4 snc1-11 plants (Figure S2A). In addition, AvrRps4-triggered resistance was also abolished in wild-type Col-0, confirming previous results [30], and in snc1-11 plants (Figure S2A). Consistent with normal growth and absence of resistance at 28C, SNC1 and PR1 expression were not elevated in srfr1-4 or srfr1-4 snc1-11 plants (Figure S2B).. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.g005. Figure 5. . Phenotypically normal srfr1-4 snc1-11 double mutants show enhanced basal defense and AvrRps4-triggered immunity.. In planta bacterial growth was measured in the indicated plant lines on day 0 (blue bars), day 2 (purple) and day 4 (yellow) after inoculation with DC3000 (top) and DC3000(avrRps4) (bottom) at 5104 cfu/ml at 22C (A) and 24C (B). Values represent averages of cfu/cm2 leaf tissue from triplicate samples, and error bars denote standard deviation. Values labeled with different letters show significant differences at the indicated days as determined by Student's t-test (P<0.05, n=3). This experiment was repeated twice with similar results.. . . . . . Altered expression levels of defense-related genes in srfr1-4 and srfr1-4 snc1-11. Previously, we showed that several defense-related genes were up-regulated in RLD srfr1 mutants, supporting our hypothesis that SRFR1 may function as a repressor in plant innate immunity by negatively regulating defense gene expression levels [29]. The growth and constitutive defense phenotypes of srfr1-4 at 22C and 24C prompted us to quantify defense-related gene mRNA levels in srfr1-4 at these temperatures using quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qPCR), and to determine whether all changes in expression in srfr1-4 can be attributed to SNC1. As expected, SNC1 transcript levels were higher in srfr1-4 than in Col-0 at 22C and 24C, as were those of RPP4 and At4g16950 (Figure 6A), two TNL genes in the SNC1 cluster that are co-regulated with SNC1 [31]. Interestingly, RPP4 and At4g16950 expression levels were higher also in the srfr1-4 snc1-11 double mutant (Figure 6A), showing that higher mRNA levels of these genes is not an indirect effect of SNC1 activation. Similarly, we observed increased mRNA levels of the CNL R gene RPS2, and to a lesser extent of RPM1, in srfr1-4 and srfr1-4 snc1-11 plants at both 22C (Figure S3A) and 24C (Figure S3B), indicating that upregulation of R genes by mutations in SRFR1 is not limited to TNL genes in Col-0. In contrast to SNC1-RLD, upregulation of RPM1 and RPS2 was not observed in the RLD mutant srfr1-1 (Figure S3C), possibly reflecting the presence of additional accession-specific SNC1-like genes in Col-0 [32] that may lead to enhanced expression of CNL genes.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.g006. Figure 6. . Transcript levels of defense-related genes are altered in srfr1-4 and srfr1-4 snc1-11.. (A) Transcript levels of the co-regulated R genes SNC1, RPP4 and At4g16950. (B) Transcript levels of NPR1, EDS1, PAD4 and SID2 (left) and PR1 (right). (C) Transcript levels of PDF1.2. Transcript levels were measured by qPCR in Col-0 (blue bars), srfr1-4 (purple), snc1-11 (yellow) and srfr1-4 snc1-11 (black) at 22C (top) and 24C (bottom), and were normalized using SAND gene (At2g28390) mRNA levels as an internal control. Values represent averages from four biological replicates, and error bars denote standard deviation. Different letters denote significant differences between values calculated by Student's t-test (P<0.05, n=4). This experiment was repeated once with similar results.. . . . SA-dependent defense related gene mRNA levels were also higher in srfr1-4 than in wild-type at 22C and 24C (Figure 6B). Unlike for TNL and CNL genes, these expression levels were reduced in srfr1-4 snc1-11 compared to srfr1-4 to varying degrees, although they were still higher than in wild-type (Figure 6B). Interestingly, NPR1 and EDS1 mRNA levels in the double srfr1-4 snc1-11 mutant showed additive increases compared to the wild-type and single mutants at 22C (Figure 6B). In contrast, mRNA levels of PDF1.2, a defensin gene whose expression is under negative regulation by the JA-responsive transcription factor JIN1 [33], was strongly repressed at 22C in srfr1-4 but induced in srfr1-4 snc1-11 plants compared to wild-type. PDF1.2 expression levels were not significantly different among the genotypes at 24C (Figure 6C). These results point towards complex modular control of defense gene expression that is influenced by a combination of SRFR1, SNC1 and temperature to varying proportions.. . . Cross-talk between RPS4 and SNC1 in AvrRps4-triggered immunity. The Arabidopsis accession RLD carries a natural mutation in RPS4 and is fully susceptible to DC3000(avrRps4) [34], [35]. In addition, introduction of RPS4 from Col-0 or Ler into RLD is sufficient to provide full resistance to DC3000(avrRps4) when compared to Col-0 and Ler [16], [35]. We also observed susceptibility of rps4-1, an RPS4 T-DNA allele in the Col-0 background, under our conditions that were used to map SRFR1 [15]. However, it was reported that rps4-2, a second RPS4 T-DNA allele in the Col-0 background, was only slightly more susceptible to DC3000(avrRps4) [36]. Based on the accession-specific presence of SNC1 in Col-0, the temperature-dependent srfr1-4 phenotype and the fact that SRFR1 was identified in a screen for enhanced DC3000(avrRps4) resistance in RLD, we speculated that the rps4-2 phenotype might be temperature-dependent. Indeed, when directly comparing plants grown in identical growth chambers at 22C or 24C, we observed a strong temperature dependence: rps4-2 plants were as resistant to DC3000(avrRps4) as Col-0 at 22C, while at 24C they were as susceptible as Col-0 treated with virulent DC3000 and as susceptible as RLD treated with either strain (Figure 7).. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.g007. Figure 7. . RPS4 and SNC1 contribute redundantly to AvrRps4-triggered resistance.. In planta bacterial growth was measured in Col-0, snc1-11, rps4-2, two independent snc1-11 rps4-2 lines and RLD on day 0 (blue bars), day 2 (purple) and day 4 (yellow) after inoculation with DC3000 (top) and DC3000(avrRps4) (bottom) at 5104 cfu/ml at 22C (A) and 24C (B). Values represent averages of cfu/cm2 leaf tissue from triplicate samples, and error bars denote standard deviation. Values labeled with different letters show significant differences at the indicated days as determined by Student's t-test (P<0.05, n=3). This experiment was repeated three times with similar results.. . . . Given the effect of temperature, we next tested whether SNC1 interferes with the susceptible phenotype at 22C. Interestingly, rps4-2 snc1-11 double mutants displayed approximately 30-fold increased bacterial growth of DC3000(avrRps4) compared to Col-0 or rps4-2 at 22C (Figure 7A), suggesting that SNC1 in the absence of RPS4 contributes to AvrRps4-triggered immunity at 22C in Col-0. However, susceptibility of rps4-2 snc1-11 to DC3000(avrRps4) was not complete compared to Col-0 treated with virulent DC3000 or to RLD treated with either strain, indicating that additional factors interfere with rps4-caused susceptibility (Figure 7A). No significant difference of DC3000(avrRps4) growth in rps4-2 and rps4-2 snc1-11 was observed at 24C, reflecting full susceptibility of rps4-2 to DC3000(avrRps4) at this temperature (Figure 7B). Recently, RRS1 was shown to be involved in DC3000(avrRps4)-mediated resistance [37], [38]. However, we observed no temperature-dependent resistance to DC3000(avrRps4) in the Ws-0 mutants rps4-21 and rrs1-1 (Figure S4). As was observed before, mutations in either RPS4 or RRS1 had equal effects on DC3000(avrRps4) susceptibility, which was qualitatively different from the redundancy between SNC1 and RPS4 (Figure 7). Interestingly, as reported before [38], we reproducibly observed approximately 10-fold higher growth of DC3000 compared to DC3000(avrRps4) in the single rps4-21 and rrs1-1 mutants and the double mutant, indicating that additional layers of resistance exist.. . . SNC1 and RPS4 interact with SRFR1. The redundancy between RPS4 and SNC1 suggests that they function in parallel to provide resistance to DC3000(avrRps4) at 22C. We speculated that this cross-talk between two R proteins might occur if both interact with proteins in a common complex. Perturbation of this complex by an effector could trigger one or the other R protein, and both need to be absent to observe susceptibility. Based on the results presented here, we reasoned that SRFR1 might be a common interaction partner of RPS4 and SNC1. In the past, transient expression of SRFR1 in Nicotiana benthamiana led to variable protein expression levels and required a silencing inhibitor for detectable expression [18]. We therefore generated stable transgenic N. benthamiana plants expressing HA-SRFR1 encoded by a genomic clone driven by the native Arabidopsis SRFR1 promoter. We first determined the functionality of this genomic HA-SRFR1 construct in Arabidopsis by testing for complementation of the stunted srfr1-4 phenotype. Transgenic plants expressing HA-SRFR1 in the srfr1-4 background showed normal growth and development (Figure S5A). Immunoblot analysis detected the expression of the transgene product in these transgenic plants (Figure S5A). HA-SRFR1 in these plants localized to microsomal and nuclear fractions (Figure S5B). This localization was consistent with the nuclear and punctate cytoplasmic localization of GFP-SRFR1 transiently expressed in N. benthamiana [18].. We observed improved and reproducible HA-SRFR1 expression in the stable transgenic N. benthamiana lines. As in Arabidopsis, HA-SRFR1 localized to the microsomal and nuclear fractions in N. benthamiana (Figure 8A). A previous study showed that RPS4 was predominantly localized to microsomes [36]. Immunoblot assays of Myc-SNC1 transiently expressed in N. benthamiana suggested that SNC1 was mainly a soluble cytoplasmic protein, although a sizeable portion accumulated in the microsomal fractions (Figure 8B). We also detected some SNC1 in the nuclear fraction (Figure 8B). We tested for SRFR1 interaction with SNC1 and RPS4 by transiently expressing Myc-SNC1, Myc-RPS4 or Myc-eGFP as a negative control in transgenic HA-SRFR1 N. benthamiana plants. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis on protein isolated 48 h after infiltration of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains showed that SRFR1 interacted with both SNC1 and RPS4 in the microsomal fraction (Figure 9). No significant interaction between SRFR1 and SNC1 was detected in the soluble fraction, even though SNC1 was detected in this fraction. No interaction with eGFP was detected in either fraction (Figure 9). As an additional control, we probed SRFR1 co-immunoprecipitated samples for the presence of GAPDH and V-ATPase. Neither protein was co-immunoprecipitated with SRFR1 (Figure S6A and S6B), indicating that the interactions of SRFR1 with SNC1 and RPS4 are specific.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.g008. Figure 8. . Localization of SRFR1 and SNC1 expressed in N. benthamiana.. (A) HA-SRFR1 stably expressed in transgenic N. benthamiana localizes to the cytoplasmic microsomal and nuclear fractions. (B) Transiently expressed Myc-SNC1 localizes predominantly to the soluble cytoplasmic fraction, with detectable amounts in the microsomes and nuclei. In (A) and (B), the microsomal and nuclear fractions are 6 and 14 times concentrated, respectively, compared to the soluble fraction. The degree of fraction enrichment was determined using antibodies against marker proteins (anti-histone H3 and anti-RNA polymerase I subunit, nucleus; anti-GAPDH, cytoplasmic soluble; and anti-V-ATPase, microsomes). Each assay was repeated at least three times with similar results.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172.g009. Figure 9. . SRFR1 interacts with RPS4 and SNC1 in the microsomal fraction.. Myc-RPS4, Myc-eGFP or Myc-SNC1 were transiently expressed via Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in N. benthamiana transgenic lines 6-4 and/or 7-1 expressing HA-SRFR1. Immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis was performed on soluble and microsomal fractions with the indicated antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies (left panel).

PMC3143138	Results. . RDO2 encodes a TFIIS transcription elongation factor. We aimed to identify the rdo2 mutation, which causes reduced dormancy and maps at the bottom of chromosome 2 [9]. To reduce the influence of natural variation between different accessions and to ease the recognition of the mutant phenotype during the mapping process, rdo2-1 was crossed with the Near Isogenic Line (NIL) LCN2-18 [15]. This NIL has a Ler isogenic genetic background, except for a 4.5 Mb introgression of Cvi at the bottom of chromosome 2 containing the RDO2 locus. Using a mapping population of 1100 F2 plants, the location of rdo2-1 could be assigned to a region of 46 kb between the markers T6A23-1 and T6A23-2 located at respectively 16.123 and 16.169 Mb. This region contains 15 annotated genes. Based on the structure of these genes (analyzed in The Arabidopsis Information Resource [16]) and their expression pattern (analyzed with Genevestigator [17]), the candidate gene At2g38560 was selected. Sequencing revealed a four bp deletion at the end of the coding sequence of At2g38560 in the rdo2-1 mutant (Figure 1A). The protein encoded by this gene contains three structural domains, named Transcription factor IIS N-terminal (TFSIIN), Transcription elongation factor S-IIM (TFSIIM) and Zinc finger (ZnF) (Figure 1B). This combination of domains is characteristic for Transcription elongation factor SII (TFIIS) [18]. Due to the 4 bp deletion, the rdo2-1 mutant gene translates into a protein lacking the ZnF domain, which most likely renders it not functional. At2g38560 has previously been identified as a dormancy gene by Grasser and colleagues [13], who named the gene TFIIS.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022241.g001. Figure 1. . Characterisation of RDO2..

(E) YFP signal in nuclei of rdo2 mutant plants that were stably transformed with a p2X35S:RDO2:YFP construct. Left panel transmission, middle panel YFP fluorescence, right panel Propidium Iodide staining. Scale bar represents 3 m.. . . . The identity of At2g38560 as RDO2 was confirmed with additional independent T-DNA insertion mutant alleles (rdo2-2/tfIIs-2 [13] and rdo2-3; Figure 1A) in the Columbia (Col) background. Both insertion mutants lack full-length RDO2 mRNA and showed reduced dormancy, similar to rdo2-1 (Figure 1C). In addition, complementation of rdo2-2 with the RDO2 genomic locus complemented the mutant phenotype (Figure 1D).. RDO2 is ubiquitously expressed throughout all plant tissues as shown in the Arabidopsis eFP browser [19] and [13]. These authors also showed that the Arabidopsis TFIIS protein is localized in the nucleus of transiently transformed protoplasts, which is consistent with a role for RDO2 in transcription elongation [13]. In agreement, we detected YFP signal in nuclei of rdo2-1 mutant plants that were stably transformed with a p2X35S:RDO2:YFP construct (Figure 1E). However, this construct did not complement the rdo2-1 phenotype. This indicates that the YFP tag probably interferes with RDO2 function.. . . Mutations in HUB1 and RDO2 affect the expression of an overlapping set of genes. The hub1-2 mutant (previously named rdo4) was identified in the same mutagenesis screen as rdo2-1 [9]. HUB1 is required for monoubiquitination of histone H2B [10]. This histone modification is involved in transcription initiation and elongation [12], which suggests that RDO2 and HUB1 are involved in the same process. The RDO2 and HUB1 genes are both ubiquitously expressed. Because their mutants show reduced seed dormancy, we analyzed their expression dynamics in detail during seed maturation. RT-PCR analysis indicated that both genes are strongly upregulated during this phase (Figure 2A, B). This increase in expression levels, together with the identity of HUB1 and RDO2 as transcription initiation and elongation factors and the observation that rdo2-1 and hub1-2 mutants have reduced dormancy levels, indicates that transcription maintenance towards the end of seed maturation is probably required for the induction of seed dormancy. Therefore, we analyzed the transcriptomes of nearly ripe siliques (18-19 DAP) of the hub1-2 and rdo2-1 mutants in comparison with wild-type Ler using Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Micro-Arrays. The hub1-2 and rdo2-1 mutants revealed respectively 2450 and 492 differentially expressed genes (Benjamini & Hochberg (BH) adjusted P-value<0.01) (Dataset S1). The hub1-2 mutant thus has a stronger influence on the transcriptome than rdo2-1. A relatively high number of differentially expressed genes (46 up- and 75 downregulated) overlapped between both mutants (Figure 3A). The significance of this overlap was determined by calculating the representation factor, which is the number of overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from two independent random picked groups [20]. The representation factor for upregulated genes in rdo2-1 and hub1-2 is 3.1 (p<3.243e-12) and for downregulated genes 6.4 (p<1.268e-39). HUB1 and RDO2 are both positive regulators of transcription and direct targets of these proteins are expected to be found among the downregulated genes. The downregulated genes indeed showed the highest overlap between hub1-2 and rdo2-1 (30% of the total number of downregulated genes in rdo2-1 overlaps with hub1-2, compared to 19% overlap for upregulated genes). One of the downregulated genes in both hub1-2 and rdo2-1 is the dormancy gene DOG1 (Figure S1). DOG1 protein is required for the induction of dormancy and differences in DOG1 expression can explain differences in dormancy levels [7]. Therefore, downregulation of DOG1 likely contributes to the reduced dormancy of hub1-2 and rdo2-1.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022241.g002. Figure 2. .

(A) Venn diagram showing the number of overlapping and unique up- and downregulated genes in rdo2-1 and hub1-2. (B) TAGGIT gene ontology classification of up- and downregulated genes in rdo2-1 and hub1-2.. . . . We used the seed-specific gene ontology classification, called TAGGIT [21], to analyze the differentially regulated genes (Figure 3B). Stress related genes are mainly found among the down-regulated genes of both mutants. The rdo2-1 transcriptome is characterized by an upregulation of cell-wall modifying and late-embryogenesis genes. The hub1-2 transcriptome shows an upregulation of translation associated, cell-cycle related and heat shock genes.. . . Predicted PAF1C associated factors are upregulated during seed maturation and are required for the induction of seed dormancy. The human homologues of HUB1 and RDO2 are Bre1 and TFIIS respectively. Both interact with the human RNA Polymerase II Associated Factor 1 Complex (PAF1C) [14], [29], which provides a platform for the association of complexes that modulate the structure of chromatin during transcription elongation [30]. Accordingly, PAF1C has a crucial role in the regulation of histone monoubiquitination and is required for recruitment of Set1 and Set2 proteins. These proteins are involved in methylation of histone H3 at respectively K4 and K36, which are activating epigenetic marks for transcription [30]. VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE 4 (VIP4), VIP5, EARLY FLOWERING 7 (ELF7) and ELF8 are the Arabidopsis homologues of respectively the yeast proteins Leo1, Rtf1, PAF1 and CTR9, which are all components of PAF1C [31], [32], [33]. ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 7 (ATXR7) is the Arabidopsis homologue of Set1 [34]. As shown in Figure 4, the vip4, vip5, elf7-2, elf8-1 and atxr7 mutants all show significantly (p<0.0001) reduced seed dormancy levels, similar to rdo2-1 and hub1-2. Alike HUB1 and RDO2, most of these genes also show a tendency towards upregulation at the end of seed maturation between 16 and 20 DAP (Figure 5), which is however only significant for VIP5 (p=0.0255) (Figure 5B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022241.g004.

Error bars represent SE, n=4.. . . . VIP4, VIP5, ELF7, ELF8 and ATXR7 are all required for expression of the flowering repressor FLC [28] and their corresponding mutants are early flowering [32], [33], [35]. In addition, FLC expression is decreased in the hub1-4 mutant and hub1 and tfIIs mutants are early flowering [13], [22], [23]. FLC may therefore represent a connection between the regulation of flowering time and seed dormancy as it is expressed in seeds and has been shown to promote germination at low temperatures [36]. However, we could not detect an altered seed dormancy phenotype in the flc mutant (Figure 6A). Moreover, our microarray data indicate that FLC expression in mature siliques is 3-times lower in rdo2-1, but 2-times higher in hub1-2 compared to the wild-type (Figure 6B). Therefore, it is not likely that the reduced dormancy phenotype of the studied mutants is caused by altered FLC expression.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022241.g006. Figure 6. .

PMC3481211	Results. . Characterization of the BnCIPK6 gene. To investigate the genes involved in response to abiotic stress, 154 salt- and drought-induced genes were identified (Chen et al., 2010), including BnCIPK6 (accession number in GenBank: JF751063) in the Brassica napus cDNA library. BnCIPK6 encodes a CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK). Subsequently, the complete DNA sequence of the BnCIPK6 gene in the B. napus genome was isolated, including its 5-flanking sequence. Compared with its cDNA sequence, it was found that the BnCIPK6 gene contains no intron in its open reading frame. In addition, BnCIPK6 protein contains an N-terminal SNF1-like kinase catalytic domain and a C-Terminal regulatory domain with a CBL-interacting NAF/FISL module (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online).. . . Identification of BnCIPK6-interacting proteins. To identify interaction partners of BnCIPK6 in Brassica napus, the yeast two-hybrid library of Brassica napus cDNAs was screened using BnCIPK6 as bait. 27 unique proteins were identified as positive clones (see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online), and all positive clones were checked for the presence of a cDNA-AD fusion and further confirmed in the one-to-one interaction analysis. The BnCIPK6-interacting proteins identified were related to various aspects of plant development, metabolism, and signal transduction. BLASTP analysis revealed that an isolated calcineurin B-like (CBL) protein (No. 27) by yeast two-hybrid screening shares high homology to AtCBL1, and consequently designated as BnCBL1 (accession number in GenBank: JF751064). To confirm the interaction between BnCIPK6 and BnCBL1 further, the BiFC method was employed. The results demonstrated that BnCIPK6 interacted with BnCBL1 in vivo (Fig. 1; see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). In addition, the experimental results indicated that BnCIPK6 protein showed no self-activation of transcription, and also interacted strongly and specifically with AtCBL1, AtCBL2, AtCBL3, and AtCBL9, suggesting that CBL-CIPK binding specificity can cross the species barrier (see Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online).. . Fig. 1. . . BiFC assays of BnCIPK6 interaction with BnCBL1 in vivo. (a-c) BiFC visualization of bZIP63 dimerization in vivo; (d-f) BiFC visualization of BnCIPK6 interaction with BnCBL1 in vivo. (a, d) YFP fluorescent images; (b, e) bright field images of images (a) and (d); (c, f) fluorescent images merged with their bright-field images.. . . . . . Transcripts of BnCIPK6 and BnCBL1 genes were induced by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA). To investigate whether expressions of BnCIPK6 and BnCBL1 genes are regulated by abiotic stresses and plant hormones, one-week-old seedlings of B. napus were subjected to different abiotic stresses and exogenous plant hormone treatments. As shown in Fig. 2a, the expression level of BnCIPK6 was significantly up-regulated by high-salinity, osmotic stress, low phosphate and ABA in roots. BnCIPK6 mRNAs were largely accumulated in roots at 3h after NaCl treatment, and reached its highest level at 48h. By contrast, BnCIPK6 transcripts reached its highest level at 12h and then declined at 24h under mannitol and ABA treatments. It was also found that the BnCIPK6 gene is strongly induced by low phosphate stress, but its expression was decreased when plants were transferred from Pi starvation to normal Pi condition (1.25mM). Similarly, the expression level of the BnCBL1 gene in roots was remarkably enhanced by NaCl, mannitol, and ABA, and reached its peak values at 1-3h after the treatments. In addition, our experimental data revealed that BnCBL1 was induced by low phosphate stress in leaves, but not in roots of B. napus (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the expression patterns of BnCIPK6 and BnCBL1 genes in different tissues of B. napus were also analysed by quantitative RT-PCR. The results revealed that transcripts of BnCIPK6 were largely accumulated in flowers, at moderate or low levels in other tissues, whereas BnCBL1 expression was at relatively high levels in stems of B. napus (Fig. 2c, 2d).. . Fig. 2. . . Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of BnCIPK6 and BnCBL1 in Brassica napus. (a) Expression of the BnCIPK6 gene in roots of B. napus under NaCl, mannitol, ABA, and low phosphate stress treatments. Total RNA was isolated from roots of 7-d-old seedlings treated with 150mM NaCl for 3, 12, and 48h, 200mM mannitol for 3, 6, 12, and 24h, 100 M ABA for 3, 6, 12, and 24h, and low phosphate (10 M phosphate for 72h, then recovered for 72h in MS medium with 1.25mM phosphate), respectively. (b) Expression of the BnCBL1 gene in roots of B. napus under salt stress, osmotic stress, and ABA treatment, and in leaves of B. napus under low phosphate stress. Total RNA was isolated from roots of 7-d-old seedlings treated with 150mM NaCl, 200mM mannitol, 100 M ABA for 1,3, 6, and 12h and low phosphate (10 M phosphate for 72h, then recovered for 72h in MS medium with normal phosphate content), respectively. (c) BnCIPK6 and (d) BnCBL1 expression in B. napus tissues. Total RNAs were isolated from roots (1), hypocotyls (2), cotyledons (3), stems (4), leaves (5), and flowers (6) of B. napus, respectively. Relative value of BnCIPK6 and BnCBL1 expression was shown as a percentage of BnACT2 expression activity; ck, untreated roots (control). Mean values and standard errors (bar) were shown from three independent experiments. Independent t tests for equality of means demonstrated that there was significant difference (*P value <0.05) or very significant difference (**P value <0.01) between untreated (control) and treated roots or leaves.. . . . . . BnCIPK6 promoter is salt/osmotic stress- and ABA-inducible. To investigate whether the BnCIPK6 promoter is induced by abiotic stresses and hormone treatments, a 1.2kb BnCIPK6 5-flanking region before the translational initiation codon (ATG) was cloned upstream of the GUS reporter gene in the pBI101 vector, giving rise to the BnCIPK6p:GUS chimeric gene. The construct was introduced into Arabidopsis. A total of 30 transgenic Arabidopsis plants (lines) were obtained. Histochemical assay revealed that GUS staining was detected at relatively high levels in hypocotyls and cotyledons in 12-d-old seedlings, but weak or no GUS signals in other tissues (Fig. 3a). GUS activities were significantly increased in cotyledons and hypocotyls of the transgenic seedlings (12-d-old) for 6h after 150mM NaCl, 300mM mannitol, and 100 M ABA treatments, compared with those of mock treatments (Fig. 3b-d). It should be noted that GUS activities were detected in the maturation zone of roots after these treatments, but not in those of control transgenic seedlings. Quantitative analysis further confirmed that GUS activity was higher in the salinity, osmotic, and ABA-treated transgenic plants than those of the mock treatment (Fig. 3e). These results suggested that the BnCIPK6 promoter is salt-/osmotic stress-/ABA-inducible.. . Fig. 3. . . Analysis of BnCIPK6 promoter activity in Arabidopsis plants under NaCl, mannitol, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. 12-d-old transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings containing the BnCIPK6 promoter fused to the GUS reporter gene were treated without (control) or with 150mM NaCl, 300mM mannitol, and 100 M ABA for 6h.

(e) Measurement and quantitative analysis of GUS activity in BnCIPK6p:GUS transgenic Arabidopsis plants under NaCl, mannitol or ABA treatments. Mean values and standard errors (bar) were shown from three independent experiments. Independent t tests for equality of means demonstrated that there was very significant difference between CK and NaCl-, mannitol-, or ABA-treated transgenic plants (**P value <0.01).. . . . . . Assay of BnCIPK6 kinase activity in vitro. To characterize the kinase activity of BnCIPK6 biochemically, MBP-BnCIPK6 and MBP-BnCIPK6M (T182D, i.e. Thr182 was substituted by Asp in BnCIPK6, hereafter referred to as BnCIPK6M) proteins, as well as empty MBP protein from Escherichia coli, were expressed. As shown in Fig. 4a and 4b, BnCIPK6M mutant protein exhibited 2.3-fold higher autophosphorylation activity than that of BnCIPK6 protein, suggesting that the 182nd threonine residue in BnCIPK6 may be a critical target site for the protein activation by upstream kinase(s).. .

(f) Measurement of proline content in seedlings of wild-type and transgenic lines treated with 170mM and 200mM NaCl for 24h. Mean values and standard errors (bar) were shown from three independent experiments (n >50 seedlings per each line). Independent t tests for equality of means demonstrated that there was very significant difference between wild type and transgenic plants (**P value <0.01). (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . . . Over-expression of BnCIPK6 and BnCBL1 in Arabidopsis enhances plant tolerance to salt stress. The coding sequences of BnCIPK6 and BnCIPK6M fused to the CaMV 35S promoter were introduced into Arabidopsis, and over 30 homozygous transgenic lines (T2 and T3 generations) were obtained. Expression levels of BnCIPK6 and BnCIPK6M in the transgenic plants were examined by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4c). Two transgenic lines (L8 and L9) with higher BnCIPK6M expression and two lines (L3 and L6) with higher BnCIPK6 expression were selected for analysng their phenotypes under various treatment conditions. When 1-week-old seedlings grew on MS medium under normal conditions, there was no difference between wild type and transgenic plants. When 1-week-old seedlings were transferred and vertically cultured on MS medium containing a range of NaCl concentrations, both BnCIPK6 and BnCIPK6M transgenic lines displayed better salt tolerance than that of wild-type plants (Fig. 4d; see Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online). Statistical analysis indicated that there were significant differences in chlorophyll content, and proline content between BnCIPK6/BnCIPK6M transgenic lines and control plants under salt stress (Fig. 4e, 4f).. Similarly, in order to determine whether BnCBL1 is also involved in salt signalling, the BnCBL1 gene was introduced into Arabidopsis plants. Over 20 homozygous transgenic lines (T2 and T3 generations) were obtained, of which the lines with high BnCBL1 expression were selected for more detailed analysis (Fig. 5a; see Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). The results also revealed that BnCBL1 transgenic seedlings showed increased NaCl-tolerance, compared with the wild type (Fig. 5; see Supplementary Table S4 at JXB online). These data indicated that over-expression of BnCIPK6, BnCIPK6M, and BnCBL1 significantly enhanced plant tolerance to salt stress.. . Fig. 5. . .

Over-expression of BnCIPK6 and BnCBL1 in Arabidopsis enhances plant tolerance to low phosphate stress. Six-day-old BnCBL1, BnCIPK6, and BnCIPK6M transgenic seedlings were transferred and vertically cultured at 50 M low phosphate medium for 9 d. It was found that BnCIPK6 and BnCIPK6M transgenic seedlings grew better than wild-type plants under low phosphate conditions, whereas there was no significant difference between the transgenic plants and the wild type under phosphate-sufficient conditions (Fig. 6a, 6b). In addition, BnCIPK6 and BnCIPK6M transgenic seedlings have more and longer lateral roots than those of the wild type (Fig. 6c; see Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online). The fresh weight of BnCIPK6 and BnCIPK6M transgenic plants was also larger than that of the wild type. Likewise, BnCBL1 transgenic seedlings displayed higher low-phosphate tolerance than that of the wild type at the concentrations tested (Fig. 6d, 6e, 6f; see Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online). Collectively, these results suggested that BnCBL1 and BnCIPK6 may be involved in plant response and tolerance to low-phosphate.. . Fig. 6. . . Over-expression of BnCIPK6, BnCIPK6M, and BnCBL1 in Arabidopsis enhances plant tolerance to phosphorous starvation.

(f) Statistical analysis of plant fresh weight. Mean values and standard errors (bar) were shown from three independent experiments (n >50 seedlings per each line).

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . . . Activation of BnCIPK6 confers Arabidopsis plants hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA). To determine whether BnCIPK6 protein is involved in the ABA signalling pathway, the transgenic lines were tested under exogenous ABA treatment. When germinated and grown on MS medium, BnCIPK6 and BnCIPK6M transgenic plants grew almost the same as the wild type (Fig. 7a, 7c). When cultured on MS medium with 0.25-1 M ABA for several days, however, both seed germination and primary root growth of BnCIPK6M and BnCIPK6 transgenic plants were severely inhibited, compared with wild-type plants (Fig. 7b; see Supplementary Table S5 at JXB online). When seedlings were grown on MS medium containing 0.5 M ABA, the root length of the BnCIPK6M transgenic lines was shorter than that of the wild type (Fig. 7d). Measurement and statistical analysis indicated that the root length of two BnCIPK6M transgenic lines was significantly less than 70% of the wild type, whereas the root length of the BnCIPK6 lines was over 80% of the wild type on MS medium with 0.5 M ABA (Fig. 7e). These results demonstrated that both germination and post-germination growth of BnCIPK6M transgenic plants were more ABA-sensitive than those of BnCIPK6 transgenic plants, suggesting that activation of BnCIPK6 may be important for its participation in ABA signalling transduction.. .

WT, wild type; B6(M)L8 and L9, BnCIPK6M transgenic line 8 and 9; B6L3 and L6, BnCIPK6 transgenic line 3 and 6. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . To investigate further the mechanism of the constitutively activated kinase, BnCIPK6M, involved in the ABA signalling pathway, it was examined whether expression of ABA-responsive genes (such as RD29A, RD29B, KIN1, ABF3, and ABF4) in BnCIPK6M transgenic lines, served as markers for monitoring ABA and stress response pathways. As shown in Fig. 8, expression levels of ABF3, ABF4, and RD29A in the transgenic plants were much higher than those in the wild type under ABA treatment although there was no significant difference in expression levels of those genes between the transgenic plants and the wild type in the absence of ABA. However, there was only slight or no significant decrease in mRNA levels of RD29B and KIN between wild-type and transgenic plants with or without ABA treatment. These results further suggest that the constitutively activated BnCIPK6, which displayed higher kinase activity, may be involved in the ABA signalling pathway, acting upstream of these marker genes. On the other hand, it was found that BnCBL1 over-expression transgenic plants did not show detectable phenotypic change under ABA treatments (data not shown) although BnCBL1 can interact with BnCIPK6, suggesting that other CBLs that interacted with BnCIPK6 protein may be involved in the response to ABA.. . Fig. 8. . . Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of expression of stress- and ABA-responsive genes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing BnCIPK6M. Total RNA was isolated from 2-week-old seedlings without (-ABA) and with ABA treatment (+ABA) for 6h, respectively. Transcript levels of RD29A, RD29B, KIN1, ABF3, and ABF4 were determined by quantitative RT-PCR, using ACTIN2 as a quantification control. Independent t tests for equality of means demonstrated that there was (very) significant difference between wild-type and transgenic plants (*P value <0.05; **P value <0.01).. . . . . . BnCIPK6 functionally complemented the defects of the atcipk6 mutant. The homozygous lines of the Arabidopsis cipk6 mutant (SM_3_39539) obtained from ABRC were identified by PCR using gene-specific and T-DNA-specific primers (3 dSpm). To confirm that cipk6 is a transcript-null mutant, RT-PCR analysis was performed. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S7 at JXB online, no CIPK6 transcripts were detected in three lines of cipk6ko seedlings. Phenotypic analysis revealed that cipk6ko seedlings were more sensitive to salt and low phosphate stress, and confers the plant ABA-insensitive phenotype (our unpublished data).. To investigate whether BnCIPK6 performs a similar function as AtCIPK6, functional complementation analysis was performed. BnCIPK6, under the CaMV 35S promoter, was expressed in Arabidopsis cipk6 knockout mutants (cipk6/35S:BnCIPK6). RT-PCR analysis showed that strong BnCIPK6 expression was only detected in the complemented transgenic lines. Under normal growth conditions, cipk6/BnCIPK6 transgenic plants did not show noticeable phenotypes compared with wild-type and cipk6 mutant plants. By contrast, the cipk6/BnCIPK6 transgenic lines completely rescued the low-phosphate-sensitive and ABA-insensitive phenotypes of the cipk6 mutants under low phosphate stress and ABA treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S8 at JXB online), suggesting that both BnCIPK6 and AtCIPK6 proteins may perform similar function in plants..
PMC4502342	Results. . Growth parameters and relative water content. Shoot and root biomass, length of primary and lateral roots, leaf area and percentage of seed germination were determined for the different genotypes with or without salt (Table 1). Under non-saline conditions, there were no statistically significant differences in shoot fresh (FW) and dry weights (DW) among genotypes. However, root FW and DW of the myb28myb29 mutant were roughly halved in respect to wild type (WT) or the myb28 mutant, in accordance with a shorter primary root length, as previously reported (Beekwilder et al., 2008). By contrast, salinity reduced shoot DW in all genotypes, as expected for plants with a diminished leaf area, but it did not affect, in the double mutant, either root DW or primary and lateral root lengths; the single mutant showed an increase in total lateral root length. In the WT, salt stress reduced the primary and lateral root lengths, while DW was maintained due to the increase in the number of lateral roots.. . Table 1. .

Different letters indicate statistical differences (Tukey, P < 0.05, n = 20 for each treatment).. . . . Total lateral root length in the myb28myb29 mutant was lower than in WT or the myb28 mutant but it was not affected by the presence of salt. Seed germination was reduced in the myb28myb29 mutant compared to WT and the single myb28 mutant.. Leaf area was greatest in WT followed by the myb28 mutant and smallest in the myb28myb29 mutant. Salinity decreased leaf area in all genotypes, with the exception of the myb28 mutant where it remained stable.. . . Hydraulic conductance and whole plant transpiration. The root hydraulic conductance (L0) was determined for all three genotypes by root pressurization (Figure 1A). In the absence of the salt treatment, the L0 of the myb28myb29 mutant was comparable to that of the WT and myb28 mutant. Salinity reduced L0 by 49.1 and 46.3% in the WT and single mutant, respectively, and by 63.0% in the double mutant.. . Figure 1. .

Mean values  standard errors are shown (n = 10). Mean values with different letters represent significant (P < 0.05) differences according to the Tukey test.. . . . The relative water content (RWC) of the myb28myb29 mutant was significantly reduced by NaCl addition, whereas salinity had no effect on the RWC in the WT and myb28 mutant (Figure 1B).. Under salt stress, reductions in whole plant transpiration were higher in the WT and myb28 mutant, which had similar values, compared to the myb28myb29 mutant. However, under non-saline conditions, the whole plant transpiration was similar in all three genotypes (Figure 1C).. . . PIP aquaporin abundance in the roots of the Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes. For quantification of the A. thaliana PIP1 and PIP2 protein abundance in roots, Western Blotting was performed. Two specific antibodies developed against the PIP1 and PIP2 homologs of A. thaliana were used for protein immunodetection and two bands-at 29 kDa (monomeric form) and 58 kDa (dimeric form)-were detected in all samples (Figure 2). Under non-saline conditions, no significant differences were observed in the abundance of either PIP subfamily among the genotypes. However, the immunostain intensity differed among the genotypes when exposed to salinity. Thus, in general, the NaCl treatment decreased PIP1 (Figure 2A) and PIP2 (Figure 2B) abundance in the three genotypes, the reductions being 14.0, 56.4, and 21.2% in the PIP1 subfamily and 24.0, 50.3, and 41.2% in the PIP2 subfamily of the WT, myb28myb29 and myb28 plants, respectively.. . Figure 2. . Immunodetection of PIP1 (A) and PIP2 (B) homologs in the root plasma membrane (PM) of. Arabidopsis thaliana. ecotype Col-0 wild type (WT), single (myb28) and double (myb28myb29) knockout mutants under non-saline (0 mM NaCl) and saline (100 mM NaCl) conditions. Total PM was separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies against AtPIP1 and AtPIP2. The PIP1 and PIP2 protein amounts (monomers and dimers) were quantified using the Quantity one program from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Mean values are shown (n = 3). Mean values with different letters represent significant (P < 0.05) differences according to the Tukey test. The scanned bands were normalized by calculating the ratio to the corresponding Coomassie-stained aquaporin band (29 KDa) ensuring that different intensities were not due to different loaded protein amounts.. . . . Correlation between L0 and signal intensity of PIP2 and PIP2 was expressed in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2). R2 indicated the fraction of the variability in L0 that can be explained by the variability in aquaporin abundance through their linear relationship. High values for both PIP1 (R2 = 0.795) and PIP2 (R2 = 0.877) were observed.. . . Mineral content. The ion concentrations in the leaves of the three genotypes were similar, under both non-saline and saline conditions (Table 2). Thus, salinity decreased the Ca, K, and S levels with regard to the control and increased the Na concentration in the three genotypes similarly, whereas the Mg, P, and N levels remained unchanged. The C level was increased by salinity in WT and myb28 plants, but was unmodified in the myb28myb29 mutant.. . Table 2. .

The Arabidopsis leaves contained mainly glucoiberin (3MSOP), glucoraphanin (4MSOB), glucoalyssin (5MSOP), glucohesperin (6MSOH), glucosibarin (7MSOH) and glucohirsutin (8MSOO) as aliphatic glucosinolates (Table 3), while the major indole glucosinolates were glucobrassicin (I3M) and 4-methoxy-glucobrassicin (4MI3M), depending on the genotype. Thus, short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates were detected in the WT and myb28 mutant, whereas long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates were found exclusively in the WT.

In general, aliphatic glucosinolates were increased by salinity in WT (~2-fold) and myb28 mutant (~2.5-fold), reaching similar values (Figure 4). The level of the indolic glucosinolates was significantly higher in the myb28myb29 mutant (~1.8-fold), compared to the WT and myb28 mutant, but salinity decreased their content in the double mutant and left it unchanged in the WT and single mutant. Total glucosinolates were lower in the myb28myb29 mutant and salinity had no effect on their content.

The long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates 6MSOH, 7MSOH, and 8MSOO, detected only in the WT, were decreased by salinity, with 6MSOH becoming undetectable. The level of I3M was higher in the myb28myb29 mutant, where it was significantly reduced by salinity (~11.5-fold). Similarly, in the myb28 mutant, I3M was diminished by salt treatment (~1.3-fold), but it remained constant in WT. Under non-saline conditions, the 4MI3M content was similar in the three genotypes but salt stress decreased the level of this indolic glucosinolate in the myb28myb29 (~2.5-fold) and myb28 (~2.8-fold) mutants.. .

PMC2987829	Results. . Conserved catalytic cysteine 321 in PopP2 is required to trigger RRS1-R-mediated resistance. A conserved catalytic triad is present in representatives of the clan CE of cysteine proteases, including the T3Es YopJ from Y. pestis and PopP2 from R. solanacearum (Figure 1A). If PopP2 avirulence function was dependent on its enzymatic activity, mutation of cysteine 321 in the predicted catalytic core to a non-reactive residue such as alanine (PopP2-C321A) should abolish PopP2 ability to trigger RRS1-R-mediated resistance in Arabidopsis. To test this hypothesis, a PopP2-C321A mutant version was engineered. PopP2 and PopP2-C321A were next tagged at their C-terminus with a triple hemagglutinin (3x-HA) epitope, and expressed under the control of the native popP2 promoter. These constructs were introduced in a previously described strain of R. solanacearum (deltapopP2) from which the popP2 gene had been deleted, and therefore no longer recognized by Arabidopsis Nd-1 plants carrying the RRS1-R gene [9]. Nd-1 Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with the deltapopP2 strain expressing either PopP2, PopP2-C321A, or a GUS control. As a consequence of the recognition of PopP2 by RRS1-R, Nd-1 plants remained symptomless 8 days after inoculation with deltapopP2 carrying wild-type popP2, whereas complete wilting was observed after inoculation with the two deltapopP2 strains expressing either mutant PopP2-C321A or the GUS control (Figure 1B,C). These data demonstrate that mutation of the conserved putative catalytic C321 in PopP2 abolishes its ability to trigger an RRS1-R-specific resistance response in Arabidopsis.. . . PopP2 interacts with RRS1-R in living plant cells independent of the presence of its integral catalytic core. PopP2 is targeted to the plant cell nucleus where it is predicted to physically interact with RRS1-R, as indicated by previously published yeast two-hybrid data [9]. The inability of mutant PopP2-C321A to initiate the RRS1-R resistance response is consistent with the hypothesis that PopP2 functions as a cysteine protease and that its enzymatic activity is perceived by RRS1-R. Alternatively, we cannot exclude that the C321A mutation leads to a conformational change in PopP2 that may impair its nuclear targeting and/or its ability to interact with RRS1-R. Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of PopP2 and PopP2-C321A fused to CFP (Cyan Fluorescent Protein), under the control of a 35S promoter, led to detection of a fluorescent signal in the nucleus of both Arabidopsis and N. benthamiana epidermal cells (Figure 2), demonstrating that mutation of the conserved cysteine residue in the catalytic triad of PopP2 does not affect its nuclear targeting.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001202.g002. Figure 2. . Mutation of the conserved cysteine in PopP2 catalytic triad does not affect its nuclear localization in planta.. Confocal images of A. thaliana (A,B) and N. benthamiana (C,D) leaf epidermal cells after Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of P35S:PopP2-CFP and P35S:PopP2-C321A-CFP. Pictures were taken 72 (A, B) or 48 (C, D) hours after agroinfiltration. Bar= 20 m.. . . . A quantitative non-invasive fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) approach was then used to monitor the physical interaction between RRS1-R and PopP2. Expression of RRS1-R fused to YFPv (Yellow Fluorescent Protein venus) was not detectable in Arabidopsis cells whereas a weak fluorescent signal was observed within the nuclei of N. benthamiana cells after transient expression using Agrobacterium (Figure 3A). Therefore, FRET-FLIM studies were conducted by co-expressing PopP2, or PopP2-C321A, fused to CFP, together with RRS1-R-YFPv in N. benthamiana. This transient expression system was previously used to demonstrate the physical interaction between PopP2 and RD19, a vacuolar Arabidopsis cysteine protease that is relocalized to the nucleus in the presence of PopP2 [46]. The average CFP lifetime in nuclei expressing PopP2-CFP was 2.3860.030 ns (mean  SEM). A significant reduction of the average CFP lifetime to 1.9790.024 ns (p-value=6.410-21) was measured in nuclei co-expressing the PopP2-CFP and RRS1-R-YFPv fusion proteins (Figure 3C,4A; Table 1), showing that RRS1-R is able to interact with PopP2 in the nucleus. Mutant PopP2-C321A also interacts with RRS1-R, as shown by a significant reduction of the average CFP lifetime in nuclei co-expressing PopP2-C321A-CFP and RRS1-R-YFPv, as compared to nuclei expressing PopP2-C321A-CFP alone (Figure 3D,4B; Table 1). This result indicates that the nuclear interaction between PopP2 and RRS1-R does not depend on the presence of the conserved cysteine residue in the catalytic triad of PopP2. To confirm that reduction of PopP2-CFP lifetime, in the presence of RRS1-R-YFPv, is not due to non-specific transfer of energy between the two fluorophores, PopP2-CFP was co-expressed with either untagged RRS1-R or YFPv. No physical interaction could be detected in either case, as shown by an average CFP lifetime which is not significantly different from that of PopP2-CFP alone (Figure 4A and Table 1). Importantly, the interaction between PopP2 and RRS1-R was confirmed in Arabidopsis cells after transient co-expression of both proteins (Table 1). Taken together, these data demonstrate a specific interaction between PopP2 and RRS1-R in planta, and strongly suggest that this protein association is independent of the enzymatic activity of PopP2.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001202.g003.

Detection of the RRS1-R/PopP2 interaction prompted us to check whether the RRS1-S protein, present in susceptible Col-0 plants, was also able to associate with PopP2. RRS1-S was previously shown to colocalize with PopP2 in the nucleus of Arabidopsis protoplasts and the interaction between the two proteins was demonstrated in yeast [9]. Lack of in planta association between these two proteins might explain why RRS1-S is not able to trigger the resistance response [38]. To test this idea, RRS1-S-YFPv was co-expressed with PopP2-CFP in N. benthamiana epidermal cells. Reduction of the average CFP lifetime to 1.8890.031 ns (p-value=1.810-22) was detected in nuclei co-expressing PopP2-CFP and RRS1-S-YFPv fusion proteins (Figure 3E,4A and Table 1), demonstrating that, similarly to RRS1-R, RRS1-S associates with PopP2 in the nucleus. This result confirms the previously published RRS1-S/PopP2 interaction in yeast cells and indicates that the susceptibility of Col-0 plants to the Ralstonia GMI1000 strain cannot be explained by the lack of interaction between RRS1-S and PopP2. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that activation of the RRS1-R-mediated resistance response requires not only its physical interaction with PopP2, but also perception of PopP2 enzymatic activity.. . . PopP2 stabilizes RRS1-R and RRS1-S protein accumulation in planta. Protein co-expression experiments in planta indicated that PopP2 may be able to increase the accumulation level of YFPv-tagged RRS1-R and RRS1-S (Figure 3A,C and 3B,E). This observation was further confirmed by transiently co-expressing RRS1-R or RRS1-S, tagged at their C-terminus with a triple Flag epitope (3x-Flag), and PopP2 tagged at its C-terminus with a 3x-HA epitope in N. benthamiana. Immunoblot analysis of total protein extracts showed higher accumulation of RRS1-R and RRS1-S in the presence of PopP2 (Figure 5A). Similar results were obtained with the PopP2 catalytic mutant C321A, suggesting that the ability of PopP2 to enhance in planta accumulation of RRS1 proteins is not dependent on its enzymatic activity.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001202.g005. Figure 5. . PopP2 protects RRS1-R and RRS1-S from proteasome-mediated degradation, independent of the integrity of its catalytic triad.. A: Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of RRS1-R-3x-Flag and RRS1-S-3x-Flag alone (-) or with either PopP2-3x-HA or PopP2-C321A-3x-HA in N. benthamiana epidermal cells. Leaf samples were harvested 48 hours after infiltration and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Flag (top) or anti-HA (middle) antibodies. Rubisco is shown as loading control (bottom). B: Transient co-expression of RRS1-R-3x-Flag or RRS1-S-3x-Flag with GUS-myc in N. benthamiana epidermal cells using Agrobacterium. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (or control DMSO) was applied 24 hours after agroinfiltration. Protein samples were harvested 12 h later and analyzed using anti-Flag (top) or anti-HA (bottom) antibodies.. . . . To investigate the specificity of this observation, we next tested whether PopP2 may also promote stabilization of the previously described PopP2 interacting partner, RD19. No modification of the RD19 protein level was detected after co-expression with PopP2 (Figure S1), indicating that protein stabilization by PopP2 may be restricted to a subset of its interacting partners.. We next studied whether the turnover of RRS1 proteins is post-translationally regulated through proteasomal activity. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, both RRS1-R and RRS1-S accumulated, whereas expression of a GUS control was not altered in the same conditions (Figure 5B).. Taken together, our data (i) show that PopP2 is able to specifically promote the accumulation of its cognate partners, RRS1-S and RRS1-R, regardless of the integrity of its catalytic triad, and (ii) strongly suggest that the interaction between PopP2 and RRS1-R/S may block a molecular mechanism that leads to RRS1-R/S proteasome-dependent degradation.. . . PopP2 displays acetyl-transferase activity leading to autoacetylation of lysine 383. The observation that PopP2-C321A is affected in its avirulence function strongly suggests that perception of the enzymatic activity of PopP2 is required to trigger RRS1-R-mediated resistance. YopJ and VopA are active acetyl-transferases previously described to be able to autoacetylate in vitro [43], [47]. We thus investigated whether PopP2, being a member of the YopJ-like family of effectors, exhibits a similar enzymatic activity. Towards this goal, GST-tagged PopP2 and PopP2-C321A were purified from overexpressing bacteria and subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to assess their acetylated states. Analysis of relative tryptic digestions revealed the presence of four acetylated lysine residues (at positions 268, 285, 335 and 383) in GST-PopP2 (Figure 6A, Table S1 and S2). However, acetylation of lysines 268, 285 and 335 is probably the result of endogenous E. coli acetyl-transferase activity, since it was also detected in mutant GST-PopP2-C321A, whereas acetylation of K383 is dependent on the presence of an integral PopP2 catalytic core. Together, these data strongly suggest that PopP2 is an active acetyl-transferase that autoacetylates at its K383 residue.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001202.g006. Figure 6. . PopP2 is an active acetyl-transferase that autoacetylates on its lysine 383 residue.. A: Mass spectrometric analysis of a PopP2 peptide spanning amino acid residues 381-393. Fragmentation of this peptide led to the identification of an acetylated lysine residue within the sequence MMK(ac)HGQAASSVSR [K(ac) indicates an acetylated lysine], in wild-type PopP2, but not PopP2-C321A. Labels b and y designate the N- and C-terminal fragments, respectively, of the peptide produced by cleavage at the peptide bond in the mass spectrometer. Numbers represent the number of N- or C-terminal residues present in the peptide fragment. B: Recognition of acetylated wild-type PopP2, but not PopP2-C321A or PopP2-K383R, by an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. GST-PopP2, GST-PopP2-C321A, GST-PopP2-K268R, GST-PopP2-K285R, GST-PopP2-K335R and GST-PopP2-K383R proteins were expressed in E. coli and analysed by immunoblot using an antibody that recognizes acetylated lysines. GST-purified PopP2 recombinant proteins are shown after Ponceau staining (bottom).. . . . The differential acetylation status of GST-PopP2 and GST-PopP2-C321A was further investigated by immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed against acetylated lysine residues (alpha-Ac-K). This antibody allowed the detection of a strong signal corresponding to acetylated GST-PopP2 (Figure 6B, lane 1). In contrast, a barely detectable signal was observed in the case of GST-PopP2-C321A (Figure 6B, lane 2), perhaps due to weak acetylation at residues K268, K285, and K335 residues. Lysine to arginine substitutions were next engineered to generate GST-tagged PopP2-K268R, PopP2-K285R, PopP2-K335R and PopP2-K383R mutant versions. Importantly, PopP2-K268R, PopP2-K285R and PopP2-K335R, but not PopP2-K383R, were detected by immunoblot using the alpha-Ac-K antibody (Figure 6B), strongly indicating that only the K383R mutation prevents PopP2 autoacetylation (Figure 6B, lane 6). Furthermore, as in the case of the inactive GST-PopP2-C321A mutant, LC-MS/MS analysis of purified GST-PopP2-K383R led to the detection of a set of three acetylated peptides containing K268, K285 and K335 (Table S3). Together, these data confirm that (i) acetylation of K268, K285 and K335 is most likely due to an endogenous acetyl-transferase activity from E. coli and that (ii) K383 is the amino acid residue specifically targeted by the auto-acetylation activity of PopP2.. . . K383R mutation abrogates PopP2 intermolecular autoacetylation activity. In order to obtain further proof that acetylation of PopP2 at K383 is due to PopP2 autoacetyl-transferase activity, rather than acetylation by an endogenous E. coli acetyl-tranferase unable to target the PopP2-C321A or PopP2-K383 mutants, we next checked whether PopP2 is able to autoacetylate in trans. If this is the case, PopP2 should be able to acetylate the catalytically inactive PopP2-C321A mutant. To be able to distinguish between PopP2 and PopP2-C321A after SDS-PAGE analysis, we used a truncated form of PopP2 that lacks its first 80 amino acids (PopP281-488) but retains its acetyl-transferase activity (Figure 7A, lane 3). Recombinant GST-PopP2 and GST-PopP2-C321A proteins were respectively co-expressed with active GST-PopP281-488 or inactive GST-PopP2-C321A81-488. Purified proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an alpha-Ac-K antibody. In the presence of active GST-PopP281-488 and GST-PopP2, inactive GST-PopP2-C321A and GST-PopP2-C321A81-488 are respectively acetylated, demonstrating that the C321A mutation does not prevent PopP2 autoacetylation in trans. Although this experimental set up does not allow us to exclude the possibility that PopP2 also autoacetylates in cis, our data clearly demonstrate the intermolecular autoacetylation displayed by PopP2.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001202.g007. Figure 7. . Intermolecular autoacetyl-transferase activity of PopP2 is dependent on the integrity of K383 residue.. A: Detection of acetylated forms of GST-PopP2-81-488-C321A and GST-PopP2-C321A upon co-expression with GST-PopP2 and GST-PopP2-81-488, respectively (lane 6 and 7). B: K383R mutation prevents GST-PopP2 to acetylate GST-PopP281-488-K383R in trans. The indicated protein combinations were purified from E. coli and their acetylation status tested by immunoblot with an alpha-Ac-K antibody. The position of acetylated proteins is indicated by dashes (top). GST-purified PopP2 recombinant proteins are shown after Ponceau staining (bottom).. . . . We next investigated whether the K383 residue, which is very likely the main acetyl-CoA acceptor site in PopP2, is required for PopP2 trans-autoacetylation activity. First, when active GST-PopP2 was co-expressed with a truncated form of the K383R mutant (GST-PopP281-488-K383R) no GST-PopP281-488-K383R acetylated form could be detected, strongly indicating that K383R mutation prevents its trans-acetylation by active GST-PopP2 (Figure 7B, lane 3). Second, GST-PopP281-488-K383R behaves like inactive GST-PopP281-488-C321A, which is not able to acetylate GST-PopP2-C321A (Figure 7B, lanes 5 and 6, respectively). Thus, despite the integrity of its catalytic triad, GST-PopP281-488-K383R is impaired in its trans-acetylation activity. Together, our data show that K383 in PopP2 represents an acetyl-CoA binding site that is (i) targeted by autoacetylation and (ii) required for intermolecular acetylation of PopP2.. Finally, the protein sequences of members of the YopJ-like family of T3Es were inspected. Figure 8 shows a sequence alignment of several YopJ-like proteins in the neighbouring region of the conserved residue K383 that is targeted by autoacetylation in PopP2. This analysis showed that the K383 residue in PopP2 is perfectly conserved among all members of the family, strongly suggesting that this residue may represent a key acetyl-CoA acceptor site essential for the trans-acetylation activity of PopP2 and other members of the YopJ family.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001202.g008. Figure 8. . K383 residue is conserved among various members of the YopJ-like family.. The region flanking the residue K383 in PopP2 is aligned with that of YopJ-like representative members from plant and animal pathogens. Common residues among all shown YopJ-like proteins, including PopP2, are shown in bold and highlighted in black. Conserved residues among shown YopJ-like proteins but not present in PopP2 are shown in bold and shadowed in grey. The position of the conserved lysine residue is indicated by a star.. . . . . . Mutation of K383 in PopP2 abolishes RRS1-R-mediated immunity. The effect of the K383 mutation, which compromises PopP2 autoacetylation in E. coli, was further tested after transient expression in N. benthamiana. Expression of a PopP2-K383-CFP fusion was detected in the nucleus of N. benthamiana epidermal cells (Figure S2), confirming that this mutation does not affect nuclear targeting of the protein. In addition, co-expression of RRS1-R-YFPv and PopP2-K383-CFP led to detection of YFP fluorescence within the nucleus indicating that, as wild-type PopP2, PopP2-K383R is able to stabilize RRS1-R expression. Furthermore, significant reduction of the CFP lifetime in FRET-FLIM assays following transient co-expression of PopP2-K383-CFP and RRS1-R-YFPv, as compared to PopP2-K383-CFP expressed alone, demonstrates that PopP2-K383R also interacts with RRS1-R (Figure 4C and Table 1).. In order to investigate whether PopP2 avirulence activity is compromised by mutation of K383, the PopP2-K383R mutant was next used to transform the deltapopP2 strain of R. solanacearum. First, in vitro secretion and stability of wild-type PopP2, PopP2-C321A and PopP2-K383R were tested by immunoblot analysis. Upon incubation of the different complemented deltapopP2 strains in secretion medium, all PopP2 variants were detected in total extracts and in culture supernatants (Figure 9A). To ensure that the signal observed from supernatant was T3SS (Type 3 Secretion System)-dependent, popP2 constructs were also introduced into a deltapopP2/deltahrcV strain mutated both in popP2 and in hrcV, a gene coding for a conserved inner membrane component of the T3SS [48]. As expected, no signal corresponding to PopP2 was detected in culture supernatants of deltapopP2/deltahrcV bacteria cells expressing the various PopP2 variants, demonstrating the proper secretion of PopP2, PopP2-C321A and PopP2-K383R by the T3SS. In addition, to demonstrate that no bacterial lysis had occurred, all protein samples were probed with an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic chaperonin GroEL (Figure 9A).. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001202.g009. Figure 9. . Mutation of lysine 383 in PopP2 abolishes RRS1-R-mediated immunity.. A: PopP2, PopP2-C321A and PopP2-K383R are detected in total extracts and supernatants of deltapopP2 and deltapopP2/deltahrcv bacterial cultures. B: Nd-1 plants expressing the RRS1-R gene were root-inoculated with the deltapopP2 strain-expressing wild-type PopP2 (dark grey bars), PopP2-C321A (black bars), PopP2-K268R, PopP2-K285R, PopP2-K335R (all represented by clear grey bars) or PopP2-K383R (empty bars). Bacterial growth was measured 4, 5 and 7 days after inoculation. Means of colony-forming units per gram of fresh weight (cfu/gfw) were calculated from triplicates of three plants. For each time point, error bars represent standard deviation from three triplicates. Shown values are representative of two additional replicates.. . . . Growth of deltapopP2 expressing PopP2, PopP2-C321A or PopP2-K383R was then measured in root-inoculated Nd-1 plants. Between 4 and 7 days after inoculation, deltapopP2 strains expressing HA-tagged PopP2-C321A or PopP2-K383R reached about ten-fold higher bacterial growth rates than the deltapopP2 strain expressing HA-tagged wild-type PopP2 (Figure 9B), showing that, as previously shown for PopP2-C321A (Figure 1B,C), PopP2-K383R is not able to trigger the RRS1-R-dependent resistance response. High bacterial growth rates observed after inoculation with the deltapopP2 strain expressing mutant PopP2-C321A or PopP2-K383R correlated with the complete wilting of Nd-1 plants 7 days after inoculation (Figure 1B,C, Figure S3). As controls, deltapopP2 strains expressing PopP2-K268R, PopP2-K285R or PopP2-335R were also root-inoculated in Nd-1 plants. Importantly, these PopP2 mutants were able to trigger the RRS1-R resistance response and to multiply to the same extent as wild-type PopP2 expressing strain, demonstrating that these 3 lysine residues are not required for PopP2 avirulence activity.. Together, our data show that substitution of the K383 residue in PopP2 mimics the mutation in catalytic C321, leading to inactivation of the plant immune response. These findings strongly suggest that K383 is an acetyl-CoA-binding site in PopP2, essential for RRS1-R-mediated recognition of PopP2 activity in planta..
PMC4671723	Results. . . alp1 mutants suppress defects in several PRC1 and PRC2 components. . ALP1 was first identified in a genetic screen for suppressors of the Arabidopsis PcG mutant lhp1 [1]. Independently, we identified ALP1 in a second genetic screen [described previously in 40] for suppressors of clf mutants. CLF encodes the catalytic component of the PRC2 and acts largely redundantly with the closely related SWN gene [15,41]. Similar to the results for alp1 lhp1 plants, alp1 partially suppressed the clf mutant phenotype. The suppression was clearest in short day conditions, where the clf phenotype is milder than in long days; the alp1-4 clf-50 double mutants closely resembled wild type plants with larger, less curled leaves than clf-50 mutants (Fig 1A) and were intermediate in flowering time between clf-50 and wild-type in SD (Fig 1B). Molecular analysis indicated that alp1-4 was caused by a T-DNA insertion in the third exon of ALP1 (S1A Fig). To confirm that the suppression of the clf phenotype was caused by alp1-4 rather than any other mutation in the background, we introduced a transgene (gALP1) containing 2.9 kb of genomic DNA spanning the ALP1 locus, into the clf-50 alp1-4 background; this complemented the alp1-4 mutation i.e. clf-50 alp1-4 gALP1 plants, unlike clf-50 alp1-4, showed a severe clf mutant phenotype (Fig 1C). In addition, we found that an independent alp1 mutation isolated in a different genetic background (alp1-3 in Ler) also gave a partial suppression of the clf phenotype (S1B Fig).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005660.g001. Fig 1. . Genetic interaction of ALP1 with PcG.. (A) alp1-4 suppresses the clf phenotype. Short day grown plants at six weeks old. (B) Effect of alp1-4 on flowering time. The alp1-4 mutation partially suppresses the early flowering of clf-50 in short days. (C) The gALP1 transgene complements the alp1-4 mutation. The two plants are clf-50 alp1-4 siblings from a T3 family segregating the transgene. The plant with the gALP1 transgene has a restored clf phenotype i.e. the suppression caused by the alp1-4 mutation has been complemented. (D) FLC activity is not required for the suppression of the clf phenotype by alp1-4. Thus clf-50 alp1-4 flc-3 triple mutants have a similar supressed clf phenotype as clf-50 alp1-4 double mutants but are slightly earlier flowering due to reduced FLC activity. (E-F) Double mutants of alp1-4 with either emf1-1 or emf2-3 fail to suppress the characteristic emf phenotype of minute plants which lack rosette leaves. (G-H) The alp1-4 mutation does not suppress the clf swn phenotype including the pickle root phenotype (arrowed in G) or the proliferation of callus-like tissue (H) when grown in tissue culture. (I) The alp1-3 mutation enhances the short branched phenotype of efs mutants. (J) Western blot analysis of total histone protein extracts analysed with antibodies to H3K36me3. The blot was stripped and reanalysed with an antibody to histone H3 to check the total loading of histone proteins in each lane (lower panel). The level of H3K36me3 is decreased in efs mutants relative to the wild type progenitor. However, neither alp1-4 nor alp1-3 mutations reduce H3K36me3 levels relative to their wild-type progenitors. In addition, removing ALP1 activity in the efs mutant background does not cause any further decrease in H3K36me3 (the apparent slight decrease reflects differences in loading as revealed in the lower panel). Scale bars are 1 cm in A, C, D, I and in E, F, G and H are 1mm.. . . . Our previous analysis showed that many mutants which suppress the clf phenotype are very late flowering in both clf and wild-type backgrounds; their suppression is caused by high levels of the FLOWERING LOCUS (FLC) gene which represses FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and other key targets of CLF [40]. To test whether ALP1 also affected flowering, we characterised alp1 mutants in a wild-type (CLF. +) background. The alp1-4 single mutant had normal flowers and showed no aberrant morphological phenotype (Fig 1A); although leaves of alp1-4 occasionally showed weak downward curling we were not able to reliably distinguish mutants from wild-type siblings in segregating populations. The alp1-4 mutants had normal flowering time in long days, and in short days were on average slightly late flowering (Fig 1B), but there was considerable overlap in flowering time between mutant and wild type. Importantly, the suppression of clf by alp1 was not dependent on FLC activity, as although clf-50 alp1-4 flc-3 triple mutants flowered earlier than clf alp1-4 they nonetheless retained a suppressed clf phenotype (Fig 1D).. To test whether ALP1 interacts more generally with the plant PcG, we combined alp1 with other PcG mutants. The emf2 and emf1 mutants have a more severe phenotype than clf or lhp1, but regulate similar targets in the flowering pathway [33,42]. However, alp1 mutations did not suppress either emf2 or emf1 mutants (Fig 1E and 1F). In addition, alp1 did not suppress the severe clf swn double mutant, in which PRC2 activity and H3K27me3 methylation is eliminated from plants (Fig 1G and 1H) [43]. The MEA gene is closely related to CLF and SWN and is specifically expressed in the central cell of the female gametophyte and the descendant endosperm; in mea/+ heterozygotes about 50% of seeds abort (those inheriting the defective allele maternally) [8]. To test whether alp1 can suppress mea mutations, we made alp1-4 mea-emb173/+ plants. Similar to mea-emb173/+ plants, about 50% of seed on these plants were shrivelled (1778:1522 shrivelled:non-shrivelled, 54%, see also S2A Fig). Thus the alp1 mutation did not obviously suppress the seed abortion phenotype conferred by mea, although we cannot rule out subtle effects on the mea phenotype.. Since the genetic suppression of PcG mutants is a defining property of trxG genes, ALP1 may represent a novel plant trxG member: we therefore tested whether alp1 enhanced plant trxG mutants in double mutant combinations. Double mutants of alp1 with mutants in the ATX1 gene did not enhance the atx1 phenotype (S2B and S2C Fig). By contrast, alp1 enhanced the floral phenotype of mutants in both ULT1 and the closely related ULT2 gene, so that the double mutants had more floral organs than ult1 or ult2 single mutants (S3A, S3B and S4 Figs). Since alp1 single mutants have normal floral organ number, alp1 interacts synergistically with ult1 and ult2. The increased floral organ number in ult mutants is thought to be due to impaired activation of the floral homeotic gene AG, which results in prolonged activity of the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene promoting stem cell activity and increasing meristem size and organ number [44,45]. ALP1 antagonises CLF, which is a repressor of AG expression. The enhancement of ult mutations by alp1 might therefore occur if ALP1 and ULT act in parallel in activating AG. In addition, alp1-3 strongly enhanced the dwarf, branched phenotype of mutants in the EFS gene encoding an H3K36me3 histone methyltransferase, although alp1 single mutants had normal height and branching (Fig 1I): for example, whereas Ler and alp1-3 had a similar mean total branch number (4.0 vs 3.18, P>0.05), alp1-3 efs had significantly more branches than efs plants (34.4 vs 24.4, P<0.05). In progeny of an efs alp1-3/+ individual we observed 17 plants with the enhanced phenotype and 39 with the less severe phenotype; genotyping showing that 16 of the 17 plants with the severe phenotype were alp1-3 homozygotes whereas all 39 of the less severe were ALP1+ homozygotes or heterozygotes, consistent with alp1-3 causing the enhancement. Finally, we made double mutants in Col-0 background between alp1-4 and an independent efs allele and observed a similar enhancement (S3C Fig). Together, these data indicate a non-additive genetic interaction, consistent with ALP1 acting in parallel with EFS on common targets. In western blot analysis of total histone extracts we found that although the efs mutation reduced global H3K36me3 levels as previously reported [37], alp1 mutations did not have any effect (Fig 1J), again suggesting the two genes act independently. Collectively, the fact that the effects of alp1 mutation were most apparent in specific PcG and trxG backgrounds suggested that ALP1 has an activity towards chromatin, and that genetically it behaves as a trxG member.. . . . ALP1 is ancient and conserved throughout land plants. We previously reported that ALP1 is plant-specific, conserved in higher plants (eudicots) and encodes a 396 amino acid protein with similarity to a tranposase encoded by the PIF/Harbinger superfamily of transposons in plants and animals [1]. PIF/Harbinger transposons encode two proteins, one with DNA binding activity and the other a transposase with DNA endonuclease activity [46-48], whereas in most other DNA transposon families both activities are combined in a single protein. ALP1 is related to the transposase component, but is unlikely to retain activity as it has non-conservative substitutions (DGA in place of DDE) for two of the three acidic residues that comprise a highly conserved catalytic triad involved in metal ion co-ordination at the active site of transposases and other endonucleases [1, see also Fig 2 and S5 Fig]. To test whether ALP1 is conserved outside eudicots we queried EST sequence databases from monocots, basal angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, bryophtyes and green algae. We identified proteins similar to ALP1 in all major land plant groups. All the ALP1-related proteins retrieved ALP1 as the best hit in reciprocal BLAST searches against the Arabidopsis genome, suggesting they were ALP1 homologues. Alignments between land plant ALP1 proteins revealed blocks of conserved sequence in similar positions to the regions previously found to be conserved between PIF/Harbinger transposases (S5 Fig). We previously identified a potential DNA binding motif within a conserved region of ALP1 [residues 108-138, see 1]. Structural prediction, using the PHYRE program [49], suggests that an overlapping region (residues 96-142) has a similar structure to the homeodomain of Centromere Protein B, a DNA binding protein also related to transposases. However the sequence similarity between the two proteins in this region is very low (17% identity over 47 amino acids). We were unable to identify any other motifs associated with chromatin modification or transcriptional regulation.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005660.g002. Fig 2. . Phylogenetic analysis of ALP1 sequences from land plants and green algae.. Molecular phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (ML) method implemented in MEGA6 [74]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 200 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The composition of the DDE catalytic triad is indicated on the tips of the branches. The tree is unrooted. The species indicated are Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max (soybean), Vitis vinifera (grape), Prunus persica (peach), Theobroma cacao (cacao), Ricinus communis (castor bean), Populus trichocarpa (poplar), Solanum lycopersicon (tomato), Oryza sativa (rice), Phoenix dactylifera (date palm), Amborella trichopoda, Cycas micholitzii, Picea sitchensis, Ginkgo biloba, Cyathea spinulosa, Psilotum nudum, Marchantia paleacea, Diphyscium foliosum, Nothoceros vincentianus, Chara braunii and Zea mays (maize). PIF/Harbinger transposase branches are coloured in black, those of green algae in red, bryophytes in blue, pteridophytes in orange, gymnosperms in magenta, the angiosperm ALP1 clade in green, the angiosperm At3g55350 clade in light blue. Genbank accession numbers are prefixed GI, others are accession numbers for sequence retrieved from the 1000 plant genomes website (www.onekp.com) with the exception of the Chara braunii sequence which is given the contig number in the transcriptome assembly. The analysis involved 34 amino acid sequences. All positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated. That is, fewer than 5% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous residues were allowed at any position. There were a total of 323 positions in the final dataset.. . . . To further analyse the relationship between ALP1-like proteins and PIF/Harbinger transposases we constructed phylogenetic trees based on the aligned protein sequences. This revealed that the land plant ALP1 proteins form a strongly supported group (bootstrap value 100) distinct from that of PIF/Harbinger transposases (Fig 2). Several other observations further suggested that the ALP1 homologues are unlikely to be components of functional transposons: firstly, they were single copy in virtually all genomes queried, unlike autonomous PIF/Harbinger transposons which typically occur at much higher copy number in plants [50]; secondly, in cases where flanking genomic sequences were available we found that the ALP1 genes lacked the neighbouring gene encoding a DNA binding protein that is characteristic of PIF/Harbinger transposons; finally, comparison of the genomic sequences flanking ALP1 between Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata and Populus trichocarpa (poplar, phylogenetically close to Brassicaceae) reveals that ALP1 is in a syntenic region in all three genomes (S6A Fig) and is therefore immobile. Collectively, these data suggest that ALP1 arose by domestication of a PIF/Harbinger type transposase gene and was present in the common ancestor of all land plants. We further identified a sequence from the green algae Chara braunii with similarity to ALP1. This was not well resolved in our tree, but occupies an intermediate position between ALP1 and PIF/Harbinger, and may share a more recent common origin with ALP1 than the transposases.. Within angiosperms, ALP1 is represented by an ALP1 clade and a sister clade that includes AT3G55350, the Arabidopsis protein most similar to ALP1 (Fig 2). The genes in these two clades contain a single intron which is located at an identical position near the 5-end of the coding sequence, further supporting that they have a recent common origin (S6B Fig). In both clades, one or two of the three residues in the DDE catalytic triad that is conserved in functional transposases have been mutated (Fig 2). By contrast, in all the land plant groups basal to the angiosperms the DDE triad is conserved (Fig 2). This suggests that during angiosperm evolution ALP1 lost endonuclease activity and acquired a novel function.. The similarity between ALP1 and At3g55350 raised the possibility that the two genes act redundantly. To test this we made double mutants between alp1-1 and a T-DNA insertion allele of At3g55350 (Salk 122829), however we did not observe any obvious enhancement of the alp1 mutant phenotype (S1 Fig).. . . ALP1 activates PcG targets in clf mutant backgrounds. The suppression of PcG mutant phenotypes by alp1 suggested that ALP1 is required for the activity of PcG targets. One possibility is that ALP1 acts downstream of targets, for example to mediate their activity in conferring leaf curling. To test whether ALP1 is needed for downstream function of AG, a key target of CLF and LHP1, we introduced the 35S::AG transgene into wild-type and alp1 mutant backgrounds. The 35S::AG transgene confers a strong leaf curling phenotype, similar to that of clf mutants, due to AG mis-expression in leaves [51]. We observed a similar leaf curling phenotype in both wild-type and alp1 backgrounds (Fig 3A) suggesting that ALP1 was not required downstream of AG for its activity. To test whether ALP1 is required upstream of PcG targets for their transcriptional activation we first quantified gene expression of the key CLF targets AG, SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), FT and FLC by real time RT-PCR (Fig 3B). As previously described, expression of all four genes was strongly increased in clf-50 relative to wild-type seedlings. All four genes were less strongly mis-expressed in clf-50 alp1-4 than in clf-50 consistent with ALP1 acting as a transcriptional activator of PcG targets. To test more globally whether ALP1 was needed for PcG target activity, we compared the transcriptomes of wild-type (Ws ecotype), clf-50, alp1-4 and clf-50 alp1-4 plants seedlings. In comparison to wild-type, more genes were mis-regulated in clf-50 than in clf-50 alp1-4 or alp1-4 mutants, consistent with the more severe phenotype of clf-50 (Fig 3C). More genes were upregulated than downregulated in clf-50, consistent with the role of CLF as a repressor, and the up-regulated genes included known CLF targets (Fig 3D, see also S1 Table). Strikingly, of the 331 genes up-regulated in clf-50, the majority (73%) were no longer up-regulated in clf-50 alp1-4 double mutants (Fig 3E). Therefore, ALP1 is generally required for the activation of PcG targets when CLF activity is lacking.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005660.g003. Fig 3. . . ALP1 is required to activate PcG target gene expression.. (A) T1 plants transformed with 35S::AG transgene. The alp1-1 mutation did not suppress the characteristic phenotype of small, early flowering plants with narrow, curled leaves. (B) Real time RT-PCR analysis of SEP3, FT, FLC and AG expression in seedlings of 12 day old short day grown plants. Relative expression was first normalised relative to the EiF4A reference gene and then calculated relative to the wild type value. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean of three biological replicates. All four genes are upregulated in clf-50 but show reduced expression in clf-50 alp1-4 double mutants. One way ANOVA tests indicate that the differences are significant (p<0.05) between clf-50 and clf-50 alp1-4 for SEP3, FT and FLC but not AG.

(F-G) Inflorescences (F) and flowers (G) illustrating the enhancement of the weak lfy-5 phenotype by alp1-3. In lfy-5 flowers, fewer petals and stamens are produced than in wild-type whereas lfy-5 alp1-3 flowers from similar position on the inflorescence had much more severe phenotype with petals and stamens usually lacking and replaced with sepals and carpels, respectively (G). (H) Real time RT-PCR analysis of AP3 and PI expression in inflorescences shows reduced expression of both genes in lfy-5 compared to wild type and a more severe reduction in lfy-5 alp1-3 consistent with the enhanced phenotype. Expression is normalised relative to the reference gene EIF4A. Error bars indicate standard error of mean of three biological replicates. Scale bars are 5mm in A and F, 500mum in G.. . . . In comparisons of alp1-4 with wild-type, more genes were downregulated than up (Fig 3D), suggesting that ALP1 may also have a role as an activator in CLF. + backgrounds. Furthermore, of the 126 genes that are downregulated in alp1-4, 57 are enriched for H3K27me3 (based on [52]), a much higher fraction than the genome average (p<2.6 x E-16, hypergeometric test), consistent with a role for ALP1 in activating PcG targets. Gene ontology enrichment analysis suggested that the genes downregulated in alp1-4 were enriched for a wide range of biological processes particularly those involved in stress response and disease resistance, in contrast to the genes upregulated in clf-50 which were enriched for ones involved in flower development (S2A and S2B Table). Indeed, when we compared genes downregulated in an alp1 background with those up-regulated in a clf background (in order to identify common targets oppositely regulated) the overlap was small (4 genes, S2C Table) but did include a key PcG target, the floral homeotic gene APETALA3 (AP3). Since the effects of alp1 mutation are most pronounced in the clf mutant background, we also searched for genes that are oppositely regulated by CLF and ALP1 relative to the clf alp1-4 double mutant background. We identified a small but significant overlap of 12 genes which included the floral homeotic genes SHATTERPROOF2 (SHP2) and APETALA3 (AP3) (S2D Table). Although these results suggested that ALP1 might play a role in activation of floral homeotic gene expression, we did not observe floral homeotic defects in alp1 single mutant flowers (Fig 3F). To reveal subtle defects, we removed ALP1 activity in the weak leafy-5 (lfy-5) mutant background, which has reduced transcriptional activation of floral homeotic genes and is especially sensitive to any mutation that further weakens activation [53]. Indeed, alp1-4 strongly enhanced lfy-5 mutations, such that double mutant flowers lacked petals (Fig 3F and 3G); consistent with the enhanced floral phenotype, transcription of AP3 and PISTILLATA (PI, like AP3 is required for petal and stamen specification) was severely reduced in alp1-4 lfy-5 double mutant inflorescences compared to lfy-5 single mutants (Fig 3H).. . . ALP1 associates with PRC2 in vivo. . RT PCR suggested that ALP1 was expressed broadly in plants (S1D Fig). To characterise expression further, we made reporters that expressed in-frame fusions of ALP1 with GFP or GUS proteins under control of the native ALP1 promoter. The GFP fusion construct fully complemented the alp1-4 mutation whereas the GUS fusion construct only gave a partial complementation (Fig 4A). Since both constructs had the same ALP1 regulatory sequences, including introns, this suggested that the differences were not in expression but rather in the extent to which the fusions impaired ALP1 protein activity. The pALP1::ALP1-GUS reporter was expressed broadly in leaves, stems, flowers and roots (Fig 4B-4E), with strongest expression in meristems and young leaves similar to the expression of many other plant chromatin regulators (e.g CLF and SWN). The ALP1-GFP fusion was nuclear localised in transgenic plants, consistent with ALP1 functioning as a transcriptional regulator (Fig 4F and 4G), and was also widely expressed (S1E Fig). We also made 35S::ALP1-GFP constructs which complemented alp1-4, however we did not observe ectopic activation of PcG targets suggesting that ALP1 activity is insufficient to overcome PcG repression. To test whether ALP1 was part of a chromatin-related protein complex, we immunoprecipitated GFP-tagged ALP1 from transgenic plants expressing pALP1::ALP1-GFP or p35S::ALP1-GFP constructs and identified co-purifying proteins by mass spectrometry (IP-MS). Strikingly, in both ALP1-GFP lines the core PRC2 components SWN, CLF, EMF2, FIE and MSI1 were identified, but not in extracts from 35S::GFP control plants (Table 1). No trxG components were identified in any of the extracts (S3 Table).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005660.t001. Table 1. . ALP1 co-purifies with Pc-G proteins.. The table summarises the results from three independent replicate experiments (IP1-IP2-IP3) and lists the number of uniquely identified peptides from each protein. The total number of peptides identified in each experiment is also shown (all peptides). In IP1 some of the 35S::GFP lysate was lost during filtration, in IP3 there was considerable loss of all samples except 35S::GFP-CLF during the stage tip purification of in gel tryptic digests, hence the lower total number of peptides.

Scale bars are 1cm in A, 1mm in B-E and 20mum in F,G.. . . . We also performed IP-MS on extracts from 35S::GFP-CLF plants (Table 1). Consistent with the presence of CLF in the ALP1-GFP IP, we found ALP1 in the reciprocal GFP-CLF IP, although we also detected a few ALP1 peptides in 35S::GFP controls in two of three replicates. Furthermore, we identified the core PRC2 complex members FIE, MSI1, EMF2, VRN2 and the plant-specific PRC2 accessory components VERNALIZATION5 (VRN5)/VIN3-LIKE1 (VIL1) and VEL1/VIL2 which are thought to boost activity of the HMTase complex [12]. We also found LHP1 which has been variously associated both with PRC1 components and with PRC2 complexes in IP-MS experiments [32,33]. We did not identify SWN, suggesting that PRC2 complexes contain either SWN or CLF as the catalytic component but not both together, consistent with the 1:1 stoichiometry of PRC2 components in structural models [54]. Lastly, we identified EMF1, which has not previously been shown to associate with the PRC2 in vivo but has been strongly implicated as a PcG component based on interaction of EMF1 and MSI1 in vitro and effects of emf1 mutation on H3K27me3 levels in vivo [28,42]. Strikingly, neither the PRC2 activators VRN5/VIL1 and VEL1/VIL2 nor the alleged PRC1 components LHP1 and EMF1 were present in either the 35S::ALP1-GFP or the pALP1::ALP1-GFP pull-downs suggesting that their presence is mutually exclusive.. To verify the association of ALP1 with the PRC2 in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. To make the co-IP assays and IP-MS independent, we immunoprecipitated extracts from 35S::ALP1-GFP plants using different anti-GFP antibodies from those used in IP-MS and analysed the proteins coimmunoprecipitated with ALP1 using Western blotting. To identify CLF we first generated antibodies to an amino-terminal portion of CLF (see S1 File). The antibodies recognised both CLF-GFP and native CLF in western blots of plant protein extracts although they also cross-reacted with other proteins (Fig 5A). Using these antibodies, we confirmed that CLF was co-immunoprecipitated with ALP1-GFP whereas the cross reacting proteins were not (Fig 5B). In addition we verified that MSI1 is co-immunoprecipitated with ALP1 using a well characterised antibody to MSI1 [55] (Fig 5C). Collectively, these results indicate that ALP1 associates with the PRC2 complex in vivo. Since ALP1 is an activator of PcG targets, it presumably antagonises the function of SWN-PRC2 and/or CLF-PRC2. The clf-50 mutation is a null allele that carries a deletion of the CLF locus so that clf-50 plants have no CLF protein (see Fig 5A) or CLF-PRC2. The most straightforward explanation for the suppression of the clf phenotype by alp1 mutants is therefore that ALP1 normally inhibits SWN-PRC2 HMTase activity, so that in clf alp1 mutants SWN-PRC2 inhibition is alleviated allowing it to repress key targets such as SEP3. To test this we performed ChIP assays on chromatin at the SEP3, AG, AP3 and FLC loci (Fig 5D). In clf-50 H3K27me3 levels were significantly reduced at AG and FLC intron 1, whereas SEP3 and AP3 were less affected. H3K27me3 levels seemed to be increased in alp1-4 compared to Ws and in alp1-4 clf-50 compared to clf-50, but the differences were not statistically significant. Hence, the alp1 mutation does not alleviate the clf phenotype by restoring H3K27me3 levels. In addition, alp1 did not affect H3K36me3, consistent with the immunoblot results (Figs 1J and 4E).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005660.g005. Fig 5. . ALP1 interacts with PRC2.. (A) Western blot of seedling protein extracts analysed using anti-CLF antibodies. The left and right panels show blots with short (right panel) and longer (left panel) chemiluminescent detection times as the two extracts from 35S::GFP-CLF transgenic plants show much higher expression of GFP-CLF than native CLF. The positions of the size markers in the ladder lane have been marked on the image. Both CLF (125kD) and GFP-CLF (155 kD) migrate as larger proteins than their predicted sizes (102 and 129 kD, respectively). When the CLF protein was expressed in E. coli it also migrated larger than predicted, possibly because of the high lysine and arginine content in the N-terminal portion.

The parental genotypes grown simultaneously with the RILs showed the expected phenotypic responses (Fig. 2), whereby Cvi-0 flowered earlier than SG, and Cvi-0 did not show statistical differences in flowering time between 380 and 700 ppm CO2. In contrast, SG flowered significantly later at elevated [CO2] compared with current [CO2] (t[58] =3.33, p=0.002; Fig. 2).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049028.g002. Figure 2. . Time to flower at 380 and 700 ppm CO2 for parental genotypes (SG and Cvi-0), as well as the predicted effect of the SG allele (significant QTL on chromosome 1) on flowering time in Cvi-0 (determined through RIL responses with the SG allele).. Symbols are means 1 standard error.. . . . For the RIL analysis (parents were excluded), there were highly significant effects of RIL, chamber, and growth [CO2] on time to flower. Because we distributed replicates across four chambers, and because each chamber was used for both a 380 and 700 ppm round (in alternating order), the effects of chamber were effectively distinguished from those of RIL and [CO2] treatments. Importantly, there was a highly significant interaction between RIL and growth [CO2] for time to flower (p<0.001), indicating that RILs responded differently to elevated [CO2]. Direct inspection revealed an abundance of responses in both directions, with some RILs flowering earlier and some flowering later at elevated [CO2] (Fig. 3). The responses of RILs relative to the parents indicate transgressive segregation for both earlier and later flowering (Fig. 3).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049028.g003. Figure 3. . Frequency distribution of RIL responses for flowering time.. The x-axis was calculated as days to flower at 700 ppm [CO2] minus days to flower 380 ppm [CO2]. Thus, positive values represent delays in flowering at elevated [CO2] and negative values represent more rapid flowering (with 0 being no change in flowering time due to [CO2]). Differences for parental Cvi-0 and SG are shown with arrows.. . . . Composite Interval Mapping identified only a single major QTL for the differential response of flowering time at elevated [CO2] on chromosome 1 (Fig. 4). A genome-wide threshold for significant LOD values was established at 2.5 by permutation. An interval based on the 2-LOD drop criterion for spatially locating the QTL starts at map location 0.0 and ends at location 26.0 (ending between markers m14 and m15) of chromosome 1. This QTL accounts for approximately 1/3 of the difference in flowering time between 380 and 700 ppm CO2 between the parental genotypes (SG and Cvi-0), and therefore can be considered a QTL of major effect. The QTL mapping results for ln-days to flower within each [CO2] level are reported as Figures S1, S2.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049028.g004. Figure 4. . The LOD score as a function of map location.. The horizontal line at 2.5 is the significance threshold.. . . . The marker most near the significant QTL peak, AT1G04400, is a flowering time candidate known as CRYPTOCHROME 2 (CRY2). Other nearby flowering candidates include GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE, PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA), GIBBERELLIC ACID INSENSITIVE (GAI) and MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (MFT). The estimated effect of the SG allele at the significant QTL on chromosome 1 is illustrated in Figure 2. The dashed line shows the predicted effect on flowering time when substituting the SG allele for the Cvi-0 allele (both homozygous) at the AT1G04400 marker locus. This allele would be predicted to increase the time to flowering in the Cvi-0 genotype by 1.9 d at 380 ppm CO2 and by 3.5 d at 700 ppm CO2 (accounting for a large portion of the differential response). Furthermore, RILs containing the Cvi-0 allele at the AT1G04400 marker locus do not show flowering time differences between [CO2] treatments (p>0.25, data not shown).. There was a strong positive genetic correlation (r=0.81, p<0.001) between days to flower and number of rosette leaves at flowering when including all RILs at both [CO2] treatments (data not shown). On average, RILs with the SG allele at the significant QTL had more than twice the leaf number at flowering (Mean  SE: 311, n=130) compared to RILs with the Cvi-0 allele (Mean  SE: 14.30.3, n=220). Furthermore, genotype (SG versus Cvi-0) had a significant effect on the difference in leaf number at flowering between 700 and 380 ppm CO2 (p<0.0001). On average, RILs with the SG allele had 91 more leaves (n=65) when initiating flowering at 700 versus 380 ppm CO2, whereas RILs with the Cvi-0 allele showed only a modest average increase in leaf number between 700 and 380 ppm CO2 (1.40.3 more leaves; n=110).. For the mutant analysis with flowering time genes under the significant QTL, a difference in the CO2 response between mutant and wild-type plants would be indicative of a potential gene candidate. In other words, a significant interaction (CO2 x genotype) for flowering time would suggest that gene action at a locus is sensitive to elevated [CO2] (regardless of the direction of the response), and our QTL analysis greatly reduced the pool of possible flowering time candidates. Of the five mutants analyzed (see Methods), only MFT showed a significant CO2 x genotype (mutant and wild-type) interaction (p=0.003) for flowering time. Post-hoc analysis did not reveal a significant difference between the MFT mutant and Col-0 wild-type at 380 ppm [CO2], but these plants showed major differences in flowering time at 700 ppm [CO2] (P=0.0001), with the MFT mutant flowering much earlier at 700 ppm [CO2], while the wild-type delayed flowering (Fig. 5). In addition, there was not a significant CO2  genotype interaction between the MFT mutant and Col-0 wild-type for number of rosette leaves at flowering.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0049028.g005. Figure 5. . Response of the MFT knock-out mutant and wild-type (WT), which is Columbia (Col-0) to current (380 ppm) and elevated (700 ppm) CO2.. Symbols are means  1 standard error.. . . . For flowering time, PHYA showed no significant effects of [CO2], genotype or the interaction, and GAI only showed a genotype effect, but was not responsive to [CO2]. CRY2 and GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE only showed an effect of [CO2], and therefore those mutants did not differ from their respective wild-types in response to elevated [CO2]..
PMC3276105	Results. . Verification of NADP-MDH gene knockout in two independent lines of A. thaliana. Two independent nadp-mdh-T-DNA insertion lines were identified in Arabidopsis. The lines At5g58330::tDNA-50 and At5g58330::tDNA-119 harbour a T-DNA insertion at positions 54200 and 55324, respectively, of chromosome 5 (Fig. 1A). The combination of the NADP-MDH-specific primers 119LP and 119RP for line 119 allowed for amplification of the expected PCR product (1028bp) on genomic DNA from the WT, but not on DNA from homozygous nadp-mdh knockout plants from line 119 (Supplementary Fig. S1A at JXB online). For line 50, the gene-specific primers 121 and 84 were used and the corresponding PCR product had a size of 1320bp (Supplementary Fig. S1B). PCR products were amplified in reactions containing the T-DNA left border primer LBa1 and one gene-specific primer on DNA from both homozygous nadp-mdh mutant lines, but not on DNA from WT plants (Supplementary Fig. S1A, B). The PCR result and the sequencing of the PCR products confirmed that in both cases homozygous T-DNA plants had been obtained.. . Fig. 1.. . Genome insertion sites and phenotype of the two independent homozygous nadp-mdh (At5g58330) mutants. (A) Gene structure of the two individual AtNADP-MDH-T-DNA insertion lines Salk 012655 (line 50) and Salk 063444 (line 119). The insertion in line 50 is localized in the fifth intron, whereas in line 119 the insertion is localized in the first exon. The primers used for PCR analysis are marked as arrows. (B) Phenotype of plants of line 50 grown for 8 weeks under standard growth conditions at 50mumol quanta m-2 s-1 under a short-day photoperiod. (C) Plants were grown for 8 weeks under standard growth conditions (50mumol quanta m-2 s-1) and then transferred to HL (750mumol quanta m-2 s-1) for 7d. (D and E) Plants were cultivated under HL (750mumol quanta m-2 s-1) during their entire growth period.. . . . Both homozygous lines lacked the NADP-MDH transcript as indicated by northern blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2A at JXB online) and RT-PCR (data not shown), and were devoid of the NADP-MDH protein as demonstrated by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2B). NADP-MDH activity, when corrected for the unspecific activity with NADPH oxidation derived from NAD-MDH isoforms (Scheibe and Stitt, 1988), was also completely absent (data not shown). The results validated both insertion lines as full nadp-mdh knockout lines. Given that the two insertion lines exhibited identical phenotypes, further work was concentrated on line 50, but selected results were also confirmed using line 119.. . . Phenotypic appearance of nadp-mdh plants. The phenotype of nadp-mdh plants under standard growth conditions (GL: 50mumol quanta m-2 s-1, short-day) on soil was indistinguishable from that of the WT (Fig. 1B). Likewise, Chl a, Chl b, and protein contents as well as fresh weight and water content were not significantly altered in the nadp-mdh plants (Table 1).. . Table 1.. .

After 1d of HL treatment.. . . . Cultivation of WT plants under stress conditions such as HL, low temperature, or fluctuating light stimulates expression of NADP-MDH, indicating the requirement for an increased capacity of the malate valve (Becker et al., 2006). In this study, nadp-mdh plants treated with either HL or low temperature also revealed an unaltered phenotype compared with the WT. The GL-acclimated nadp-mdh mutant plants that were transferred to HL for 1 week (Fig. 1C), as well as the plants that were cultivated under HL for the complete growth period (Fig. 1D, E), developed a WT-like phenotype. Even under the more variable climatic conditions of a greenhouse, the potted mutants developed like the WT (data not shown).. . . HL effects on ROS formation and antioxidative systems. Accumulation of NADPH in the nadp-mdh plants could stimulate the Mehler reaction and concomitantly increase ROS formation during HL conditions. In the mutants, a decreased level of ROS was apparent compared with the WT, in HL as well as GL (Fig. 2A). The reduced and oxidized glutathione increased in both the WT and mutants upon exposure to HL, but the redox state was unaffected by the lack of chloroplast NADP-MDH (Fig. 2B). The protein levels, transcript amounts, and activities of selected Beck-Halliwell-Asada pathway enzymes were examined in WT and nadp-mdh mutant plants. No difference could be detected in either protein levels of the various APX isoforms (Fig. 2D) or the total APX activity (Fig. 2E). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a strong up-regulation of sAPX transcript and a slight up-regulation of tAPX, dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), and glutathione reductase (GR) after HL treatment (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online).. .

RNA was isolated from WT and mutant plants maintained in GL or transferred to HL for 7h, transcribed in cDNA, and amplified by PCR at the linear amplification rate using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online. The following transcripts were analysed: sAPX (At4g08390; chloroplast/mitochondria), tAPX (At1g77490; chloroplast), stromal DHAR (At5g16710; chloroplast), MDAR 6 (At1g63940; chloroplast/mitochondria), GR 2 (At3g54660; chloroplast/mitochondria), and CuZnSOD 2 (At2g28190; chloroplast/apoplast). The result is representative for two independent experiments. (D) Western blot of an SDS-gel with crude extracts from leaves of WT and nadp-mdh plants, and immunodecoration with antiserum against APX isoforms. (E) Total APX activity. . . . To address the ascorbate-independent water-water cycle, the expression of NTRC and the various chloroplast Prx isoforms in leaves of WT and nadp-mdh plants was analysed, after 7h HL. NTRC transcript and protein levels were increased in the nadp-mdh plants after 7h of HL (Fig. 3A, B), as were the transcript levels of chloroplast 2-Cys Prx isoforms PrxIIE and PrxQ (Fig. 3A), whereby the increase of the PrxA/B and PrxIIE transcripts was significant. In contrast to transcript regulation, the amount of 2-Cys PrxA/B protein (named BAS1; Baier and Dietz, 1997) was unchanged in both genotypes after HL treatment (Fig. 3C). Transcriptome profiling revealed an increase in some transcripts, among the most prominent being a C3HC4 zinc finger RING-type protein (At4g26400), a WRKY-family (At4g31550), and a MYB-related (At4g01060) transcription factor (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). These transcription factors are also found to be increased in EXECUTER mutants where signalling from the chloroplast to the nucleus is affected (Lee et al., 2007).. . Fig. 3.. .

Western blot and immunodetection using antiserum against NTRC and 2-Cys Prx were performed with extracts from WT and nadp-mdh knockout plants after 7h of HL treatment.

Asterisks indicate that the differences (P < 0.05) between WT and nadp-mdh mutants are statistically significant as determined by the t-test.. . . . . . Photosynthetic performance and photorespiratory components in WT and nadp-mdh plants under HL conditions. Photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rates as a function of light intensities were quite similar in leaves of nadp-mdh and WT plants (data not shown). Chl fluorescence was used to monitor the redox state of PSII in WT and nadp-mdh plants after growth in moderate light (GL), after growth in HL (750mumol quanta m-2 s-1) for long-term acclimation, and during a HL treatment in the measurement (20-30min) after growth in GL for short-term acclimation. Under all conditions, no significant differences in the efficiency of dark-adapted PSII (Fv/Fm), qP, NPQ, and flux through PSII (phiII) were apparent in the mutants as compared with the WT (Table 2). Also P700 absorption in leaves under GL as well as HL conditions was not significantly altered between the WT and mutant (data not shown). These observations indicate that neither a higher reduction state of the primary electron acceptor QA in PSII, nor a higher rate of cyclic electron transport, nor photoinhibition occurred in the mutants under HL.. .

Each set of data in the three experiments was generated with a different combination of light intensities during pre-treatment and measurement for WT and mutant plants, e.g. 50/50: pre-treatment of the plants at 50mumol quanta m-2 s-1, measurement at 50mumol quanta m-2 s-1.. . . . Excess photosynthetic reductant could be consumed during the reactions of photorespiration, depending on the levels of CO2 and O2. Gas exchange experiments on leaves indicated a possibly increased photorespiratory component in nadp-mdh mutants (data not shown). Therefore, an effect of HL on photorespiratory activity was further investigated in protoplasts of nadp-mdh knockout and WT plants. The photosynthetic rates of mesophyll protoplasts from WT leaves were not significantly changed at low O2 compared with ambient O2 when assayed at 1mM bicarbonate in the assay medium, while in the mutants photosynthesis was strongly inhibited at low O2 compared with normal air (Fig. 4A). Further, the transcript levels of GDC1 and GDC2 (P-protein) were higher in the mutant than in the WT after 7h of HL treatment (Fig. 4B), while the immunoblot indicated only a slight increase or no change in P-protein in the mutant (Fig. 4C). Other activities related to photorespiration, namely catalase and hydroxypyruvate reductase, were not affected in whole leaf extracts following 7h of HL treatment, either in the WT or in the mutant plants (data not shown).. .

Asterisks indicate that the differences (P < 0.05) between normal and low oxygen (in A) and also between WT and nadp-mdh (in B) are statistically significant as determined by the t-test.. . . . . . Effect of lacking a malate valve on mitochondrial activities and metabolite levels upon HL treatment. The AOX1A transcript level increased to a similar extent in both genotypes when transferred from GL to HL (Fig. 5B). However, the inhibitory effect of SHAM on photosynthesis of protoplasts was more pronounced in mutants than in the WT (Fig. 5A), suggesting an important role for mitochondrial AOX in compensating the loss of chloroplast NADPH-MDH. This was true both at low O2 and in normal air (Fig. 5A).. . Fig. 5.. . Components of the mitochondrial electron transport.

(B) Effects of HL treatment on AOX1A expression. Northern blot analysis of WT and nadp-mdh knockout plants after 7h under GL (50mumol quanta m-2 s-1) and after 7h under HL (750mumol quanta m-2 s-1), respectively. Total RNA was extracted from leaves. Ethidium bromide staining confirmed equal RNA loading. The blot was hybridized with an AOX1A-specific probe. Asterisks indicate that the differences (P < 0.05) between normal and low oxygen are statistically significant as determined by the t-test.. . . . Metabolite profiling using GC-MS revealed differences in relative metabolite contents between WT and nadp-mdh plants under GL (the full data set is presented in Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). However, the relative differences in metabolite contents were pronounced following a 7h HL treatment. The most significant metabolic differences between the WT and mutants are presented in Fig. 6 and include increases in aspartate, proline (>2-fold), and succinate, along with decreases in glutamine, 5-oxoproline, malate, and, tentatively, ascorbate (Fig. 6). The levels of sucrose and starch were unaltered between mutant and WT plants (Fig. 6, Table 1). Starch levels decreased to very low levels during the following dark phase in both genotypes (Table 1).. . Fig. 6.. . Normalized metabolite contents of WT and nadph-mdh plants after 7h of HL treatment.

An asterisk indicates values that were determined by the t-test to be significantly different (P < 0.05) from the WT.. . . . The decreased malate level in the mutants after 7h of HL was confirmed by an enzymatic determination yielding 18.0mumol g-1 fresh weight in the WT and 15.0mumol g-1 fresh weight in the mutant (Fig. 7A). Intriguingly, there was a 2.1-fold increase in proline in the mutants following the exposure to HL, while it increased only 1.5-fold in the WT (Fig. 7B).. . Fig. 7.. . Malate and proline content.

Enzyme activities of alternative shuttle systems. Indirect transfer of reducing equivalents from the chloroplast to the cytosol and subsequently into mitochondria might alternatively be mediated by oxidoreductases other than MDH, in conjunction with appropriate transporters. The enzyme activities of NADP-GAPDH of the Calvin cycle, cytosolic NP-GAPDH, and mitochondrial NAD-dependent G3PDH, thought to be involved in a mitochondrial shuttle for reducing equivalents (Shen et al., 2006) were therefore determined. The activity of only NADP-GAPDH was increased in the nadp-mdh mutants (Table 3).. . Table 3.. . Activities (mU mg-1 protein) of oxidoreductases possibly involved in redox shuttles. . . . . .

PMC3610343	Results. . MIR156A and MIR156C have dominant roles within the MIR156 gene family. The transition from juvenile to adult phase in Arabidopsis is accompanied by changes in vegetative morphology. Under long day conditions, the wild type Arabidopsis plants switch from the juvenile to the adult phase from the fifth or sixth leaf. The juvenile leaves are round, smooth on their margins, and barely develop trichomes (leaf hairs) on the abaxial side (lower side). By contrast, the adult leaves are elongated, serrated, and produce abaxial trichomes (Wu et al., 2009).. In the Arabidopsis genome, miR156 is encoded by eight coding loci (MIR156A-MIR156H) (Reinhart et al., 2002). To understand which locus or loci play important roles within this gene family, we identified all available MIR156 transfer-DNA (T-DNA) knockout plants (Samson et al., 2002; Alonso et al., 2003; Woody et al., 2007; Figure 1A and supplementary file 1A). Due to functional redundancy, none of these mutants exhibited visible developmental defects (data not shown). One of the double mutants, mir156a mir156c, displayed a similar, but weak phenotype as the transgenic plant expressing a target mimicry from the constitutively active 35S promoter (35S::MIM156), which reduced miR156 activity (Figure 1D; Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007; Todesco et al., 2010). RNA gel blot demonstrated that the amount of miR156 was moderately decreased in mir156a mir156c in comparison with the wild type (Figure 1B). Accordingly, the transcript levels of two miR156-target genes, SPL3 and SPL9, were much higher in mir156a mir156c than in the wild type (Figure 1C).10.7554/eLife.00269.003Figure 1.Phenotypic analyses of the mir156a mir156c double mutant.(A) MIR156A and MIR156C genomic regions.

Error bars indicate SE.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.003. Compared to the wild type, the mir156a mir156c mutant had a shortened juvenile phase. The appearance of abaxial trichomes in mir156a mir156c was accelerated by 2.1 plastochrons (Figure 1E). In addition, the length-to-width ratios of the blades in mir156a mir156c were much closer to those of the adult leaves in the wild type (Figure 1F). Furthermore, mir156a mir156c flowered earlier than the wild type (Figure 1E). Taken together, these results indicate that MIR156A and MIR156C have dominant roles within the miR156 family in Arabidopsis.. . . Sugar represses MIR156 expression. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the level of miR156 is regulated by age, we performed time course expression assays on miR156 and the primary transcripts of MIR156A and MIR156C (pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C) by RNA gel blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We collected plants grown under long day conditions for 8, 9, and 16 days. As previously reported, the abundance of miR156 gradually declined (Figure 2A,B; Wu and Poethig, 2006; Wang et al., 2009). Interestingly, the transcript levels of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C, but not mature miR156, exhibited damped oscillations with the highest level in the morning and lowest before dark (Figure 2C,E; Figure 2-figure supplement 1). To test whether this expression pattern is generated by the circadian clock, we grew wild type plants for 5 days in long day conditions, and then transferred them to a constant light condition. After the transfer, the oscillating expression pattern of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C was no longer observed (Figure 2D,F), demonstrating a negligible effect of the circadian clock on miR156 expression.10.7554/eLife.00269.004Figure 2.Expression of miR156.(A and B) Accumulation of miR156 in 8-, 9-, and 16-day-old long day plants.

The plants were collected every 4 hr and subjected to qRT-PCR analyses. ZT: Zeitgeber time.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.005. In addition to the circadian clock, endogenous carbohydrates are also able to trigger the oscillation of RNA transcripts (Blsing et al., 2005). To test this possibility, we carried out sugar treatment assays. Five-day-old seedlings grown in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid media were treated with sugars, including two disaccharides (maltose and sucrose) and two hexoses (glucose and fructose). The break-down of maltose results in two glucose molecules, whereas hydrolysis of sucrose produces glucose and fructose. The abundance of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C was greatly reduced after 1 day of treatment with 50 mM sucrose, glucose, or maltose (Figure 3A). A reduction in pri-MIR156A or pri-MIR156C was not detected when the seedlings were treated with the same concentration of mannitol or 3-O-methyl-glucose (3-OMG), suggesting that the repression of pri-MIR156 by sugars is not due to osmotic stress. Consistent with the reduction in pri-MIR156 levels, mature miR156 was decreased after 1 day of sugar treatment (Figure 3A; Figure 3-figure supplement 1). Accordingly, the transcript levels of miR156-targeted genes, SPL9 and SPL15, were markedly increased (Figure 3B).10.7554/eLife.00269.006Figure 3.Sugar represses miR156.(A) Expression of miR156, pri-MIR156A, and pri-MIR156C in response to sugar.

Five-day-old wild type seedlings in 1/2 MS liquid media supplemented with 50 mM sucrose were transferred to 1/2 MS media without sucrose (MS0).

(F) Expression of other pri-MIRNA transcripts. Five-day-old wild type seedlings in 1/2 MS liquid media were treated with 50 mM glucose or mannitol for 1 day.

In the sugar treatment assays, 50 mM sugars were added at Zeitgeber time 12.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.00610.7554/eLife.00269.007Figure 3-figure supplement 1.Sugar represses miR156.Accumulation of miR156 in response to sugar. Five-day-old wild type seedlings were treated with sugar for 1 day and subjected to RNA blot analyses. U6 was monitored as an internal control. Sugar treatment started at Zeitgeber time 12. Man: mannitol; Suc: sucrose; Glc: glucose; Malt: maltose.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.007. To monitor how fast miR156 responds to sugar, wild type seedlings were treated with glucose, sucrose, maltose, fructose, or mannitol for 30 min. A reduction of about 40% in pri-MIR156C was observed in the seedlings treated with glucose, sucrose, or maltose, while the level of pri-MIR156C was not altered in those treated with fructose or mannitol (Figure 3C). These results, together with the fact that glucose is the common hydrolytic product shared by sucrose and maltose, suggest that glucose plays a major role in repressing miR156.. To determine whether all the miR156 coding genes are repressed by sugar, we analyzed the expression of their primary transcripts. pri-MIR156G and pri-MIR156H were not readily amplified, probably due to their very low expression level (data not shown). The expression of other pri-MIR156 transcripts except pri-MIR156B was reduced after glucose treatment (Figure 3D).. To confirm the role of sugar in miR156 expression, we performed a sugar starvation experiment. Five-day-old wild type seedlings were transferred to 1/2 MS liquid media free of sugar and kept in the dark for 2 days. Compared to the seedlings grown in 1/2 MS liquid media supplemented with sugar under normal light conditions, the sugar-depleted seedlings exhibited a higher expression level of miR156 (Figure 3E).. To investigate whether sugar specifically represses miR156, we analyzed the expression of other miRNA primary transcripts, including pri-MIR159A, pri-MIR159B, and pri-MIR165A. The levels of all these transcripts were not reduced after sugar treatment (Figure 3F).. . . Sugar promotes the juvenile-to-adult phase transition. A recent study has shown that the juvenile-to-adult phase transition is mediated by a leaf-derived mobile signal that represses the expression of miR156 in young leaf primordia (Yang et al. 2011). Given the fact that sucrose is able to move within plants through the vascular tissues (Truernit 2001) and that sucrose as well as its hydrolytic product, glucose, repress the expression of miR156, we speculated that sugar is a potential candidate for this mobile signal. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated the relationship between sugar content and the level of miR156 in vivo. Under long day conditions, Arabidopsis plants show a rapid life cycle with very short juvenile and adult phases. For this reason, we grew wild type plants under short day conditions to extend the vegetative phase. Then 15-day-old (in the juvenile phase) and 60-day-old (in the adult phase) plants were collected at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 16. Expression analyses demonstrated that miR156 was highly abundant in 15-day-old plants but less so in 60-day-old plants (Figure 4A). In contrast to this expression pattern, 60-day-old plants exhibited a higher level of glucose, fructose, and sucrose than 15-day-old plants (Figure 4B). These results are consistent with our findings that sugar represses miR156 and indicate an inverse correlation between the level of miR156 and endogenous sugar content in vivo.10.7554/eLife.00269.008Figure 4.Sugar as a mobile signal to trigger vegetative phase transition.(A) Expression of miR156 in 15-day-old and 60-day-old wild type plants grown under short day conditions. (B) Sugar measurement. Fifteen-day-old and 60-day-old short day plants were collected at Zeitgeber time 16. The fructose (Fru), glucose (Glc), and sucrose (Suc) content was analyzed by GC-MS and quantified. **Significant difference from 15-day-old wild type plants, Student t-test, p<0.001.

Seven-day-old wild type seedlings were defoliated and sucrose (Suc) or mannitol (Man) was applied to the defoliated petioles. The shoot apices were collected for expression analyses 2 days after defoliation.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.008. We then performed defoliation assays. The blades of the first two leaves of 7-day-old wild type seedlings were manually removed. Then 50 mM sucrose or mannitol (as control) was applied to the petioles of the defoliated leaves (Figure 4C). Consistent with the previous report (Yang et al. 2011), the removal of the first two leaves resulted in an increased level of miR156 in the shoot apices (Figure 4F). The expression of adult-specific traits was accordingly delayed. Compared to intact plants, the production of abaxial trichomes in the defoliated plants was delayed by 1.0 plastochrons (Figure 4D), and the increase in the length-to-width ratio of the lamina was slower (Figure 4E).. Sucrose application partially suppressed the delay in the juvenile-to-adult phase transition caused by defoliation. The sucrose-treated plants produced the abaxial trichomes 0.8 plastochrons later than intact wild type plants, but 1.6 plastochrons earlier than the mannitol-treated plants (Figure 4D). In addition, the length-to-width ratios of the fifth, seventh, and ninth leaves in the sucrose-treated plants were higher than those in the mannitol-treated plants (Figure 4E). In agreement with these phenotypic differences, the expression of miR156 was reduced in the apices of the sucrose-treated plants but not in those treated with mannitol (Figure 4F).. . . A reduced photosynthetic rate delays the juvenile-to-adult phase transition. To confirm the role of sugar in the juvenile-to-adult phase transition, we analyzed the Arabidopsis cao/chlorina1 (ch1) mutant. A mutation in CAO/CH1 (At1g44446), which encodes chlorophyll (Chl) a oxygenase, causes a reduced level of Chl b and low efficiency of photosynthesis (Espineda et al., 1999). Compared to the wild type, the cao/ch1 mutant developed smaller pale green leaves and had a prolonged juvenile phase (Figure 5-figure supplement 1). The rosette leaves in the cao/ch1 mutant were rounder than those in the wild type plant (Figure 5A,B). Additionally, the appearance of abaxial trichomes in the cao/ch1 mutant was delayed (Figure 5C). Expression analyses indicated that higher levels of miR156 accumulated in the cao/ch1 mutant than in the wild type plant (Figure 5D).10.7554/eLife.00269.009Figure 5.cao/ch1 mutant impairs vegetative phase transition.(A) Leaf morphology of wild type, cao/ch1, and 35S::MIM156 cao/ch1 plants under long day conditions.

Five-day-old wild type and cao/ch1 mutants in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid media were treated with 50 mM glucose or mannitol for 1 day. The expression levels in the mannitol-treated wild type or cao/ch1 were set to 1. The treatment was started at Zeitgeber time 12. **Significant difference from wild type, Student t-test, p<0.001. Error bars indicate SE.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.00910.7554/eLife.00269.010Figure 5-figure supplement 1.Phenotype of cao mutant.Plant morphology of wild type (wt), cao/ch1, and 35S::MIM156 cao/ch1. Scale bar indicates 1.0 cm.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.010. To examine whether the delayed phase transition in cao/ch1 depends on miR156 function, we crossed 35S::MIM156 into cao/ch1. Similarly to 35S::MIM156, 35S::MIM156 cao/ch1 produced the abaxial trichomes on the first leaf, and the leaves were elongated and serrated (Figure 5A-C; Figure 5-figure supplement 1). Compared to the wild type, the cao/ch1 mutants exhibited higher glucose sensitivity. Treatment of cao/ch1 seedlings with 50 mM glucose significantly reduced the level of miR156 (Figure 5E). Taken together, we conclude that sugar from the pre-existing leaves acts as a mobile signal to trigger the juvenile-to-adult phase transition through repression of miR156 in the young leaf primordia.. . . Repression of miR156 by sugar is evolutionarily conserved. miR156 is present in all major plant taxa (Axtell and Bowman, 2008). To test whether the regulation of miR156 by sugar is evolutionarily conserved, we examined the expression of miR156 in response to sugar in other plants, including Nicotiana benthamiana (tobacco), Physcomitrella patens (moss), and Solanum lycopersicum (tomato).. N. benthamiana and S. lycopersicum were grown in 1/2 MS liquid media without sugar. After the first two leaves appeared, the seedlings were treated with 50 mM sucrose for 2 days. The seedlings of N. benthamiana and S. lycopersicum were collected and used for expression analyses. For P. patens, the sugar treatment was conducted during the protonema stage. Compared to those treated with mannitol, the amount of miR156 was greatly reduced in all the sucrose-treated plants (Figure 6), indicating that repression of miR156 by sugar is evolutionarily conserved.10.7554/eLife.00269.011Figure 6.Repression of miR156 by sugar is evolutionarily conserved.Expression of miR156 in Physcomitrella patens, Solanum lycopersicum, and Nicotiana benthamiana. The plants were treated with 50 mM sucrose (Suc) or mannitol (Man) for 2 days. U6 was monitored as the loading control. Treatment was started at Zeitgeber time 12.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.011. . . Sugar regulates miR156 expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. To investigate at which level sugar represses miR156, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses (ChIP) using anti-RNA polymerase II (anti-Pol II) antibody, which recognizes the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat of RNA Pol II and has been used to correlate RNA Pol II binding with gene expression. Enrichment of the promoter fragments of MIR156A and MIR156C was compared between the seedlings treated with mannitol and those treated with glucose. As shown in Figure 7A, the promoter fragments (harboring TATA boxes) of MIR156A and MIR156C were substantially enriched in the mannitol-treated seedlings, but not in those treated with glucose, indicating that glucose induces transcriptional repression of MIR156A and MIR156C (Figure 7A).10.7554/eLife.00269.012Figure 7.Sugar promotes the degradation of miR156 primary transcripts.(A) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses. Five-day-old wild type seedlings were treated with 50 mM glucose (Glc) or mannitol (Man) for 1 day. Anti-Pol II was used for ChIP analyses. The genomic fragments near the MIR156A or MIR156C TATA box were amplified. Relative enrichment was calculated by the ratio of bound DNAs after ChIP to input DNAs. (B) Expression of HXK1 in response to glucose. Five-day-old wild type seedlings in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid media were pre-treated with or without actinomycin (ActD) for 12 hr. The seedlings were harvested at 0, 1, and 3 hr after 50 mM glucose or mannitol was added. The expression level at 0 hr was set to 1.

Sugar treatment was started at Zeitgeber time 12.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.01210.7554/eLife.00269.013Figure 7-figure supplement 1.Effect of CHX on sugar-induced pri-MIR156C degradation.Five-day-old wild type seedlings in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog liquid media were pre-treated with actinomycin-D (ActD) for 12 hr.

Glucose (50 mM) was added at Zeitgeber time 12.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.01310.7554/eLife.00269.014Figure 7-figure supplement 2.Expression analyses of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C in upf mutants.(A) Expression of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C in upf1-5 and upf3-1 mutants. Seven-day-old wild type (WT), upf1-5, and upf3-1 seedlings were used for expression analyses. (B) Glucose response in upf mutants. Five-day-old wild type and upf1-5 seedlings in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog liquid media were pre-treated with actinomycin-D (ActD) for 12 h. The transcript level of pri-MIR156C was monitored at 0, 3, and 6 hr after glucose (Glc) or mannitol (Man) treatment. Glucose (50 mM) was added at Zeitgeber time 12.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.014. We next examined the effect of actinomycin-D (ActD), which blocks transcription. To test transcription blocking efficiency, we analyzed the expression of HXK1, which is rapidly induced by glucose (Price et al., 2004). The transcript level of HXK1 was increased about fourfold after 3 h of glucose treatment. By contrast, the expression of HXK1 was not altered in the seedlings treated with glucose and ActD (Figure 7B).. The addition of ActD did not affect repression of pri-MIR156C by glucose. The transcript level of pri-MIR156C was reduced by about 75% after 3 hr in the presence of glucose, compared to a 30% reduction in the presence of mannitol (Figure 7D). A similar expression pattern was observed in pri-MIR156A (Figure 7C), suggesting that glucose modulates miR156 expression at the post-transcriptional level through the degradation of pri-MIR156.. To investigate whether the reduction in miR156 primary transcripts after glucose treatment was caused by an increase in the processing efficiency of pri-MIR156, we performed the glucose treatment assay using the serrate (se) mutant which is defective in miRNA biogenesis (Grigg et al., 2005; Lobbes et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2006; Laubinger et al., 2008). Similar to the wild type, the amount of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C was markedly decreased in the ActD/glucose-treated se-3 mutant (Figure 7C,D), indicating that glucose regulates the abundance of pri-MIR156 independently of the miRNA processing machinery.. HXK1 encodes a glucose sensor that transduces diverse sugar signals. gin2-1, the HXK1-null mutant (Moore et al. 2003), exhibited a lower level of miR156 than the wild type (Figure 8A). The expression of miR156 still decreased over time in the gin2-1 mutant (Figure 8B). To test whether the repression of miR156 by sugar is mediated by HXK1, we compared the glucose response between the wild type and the gin2-1 mutant. The expression of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C was reduced after sugar treatment in both the wild type and the gin2-1 mutant (Figure 8C,D). Similarly, an evident decrease in pri-MIR156C was observed in the gin2-1 seedlings treated with ActD/glucose (Figure 8E). These results suggest that HXK1 plays a role in miR156 expression but is not absolutely required for the repression of miR156 by sugar.10.7554/eLife.00269.015Figure 8.The role of HXK1 in sugar-induced miR156 repression.(A) Expression of miR156 in the 5-day-old wild type (ecotype Ler) and gin2-1 mutant.

(E) Expression of pri-MIR156C in Ler and gin2-1. Five-day-old seedlings in 1/2 MS liquid media were pre-treated with actinomycin-D (ActD) for 12 hr and then treated with 50 mM glucose or mannitol. The expression level of pri-MIR156C in Ler at 0 hr was set to 1. Sugar treatment was started at Zeitgeber time 12.DOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.015. We then performed the sugar treatment assay in the presence of ActD and cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The level of pri-MIR156C transcripts was greatly reduced in the ActD-treated samples, but not in those treated with both ActD and CHX (Figure 7-figure supplement 1), suggesting that sugar-induced pri-MIR156C degradation requires de novo protein synthesis.. mRNAs can be degraded through several partially independent pathways, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), 5-to-3 mRNA degradation via exonucleases, and 3-to-5 mRNA degradation via the exosome. The UP-frameshift (UPF) proteins, UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3, are essential for the NMD function in plants (Arciga-Reyes et al., 2006; Kurihara et al., 2009). It has been shown that upf1 and upf3 mutants impair the sugar response and over-accumulate sugar-inducible mRNAs (Yoine et al. 2006). Therefore, we investigated the role of UPF in the sugar-mediated repression of miR156. Compared to the wild type, the expression of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C was slightly increased in upf1-5 and upf3-1 mutants (Figure 7-figure supplement 2A). Glucose was still able to repress the accumulation of pri-MIR156C, albeit to a lesser extent (Figure 7-figure supplement 2B), indicating that sugar promotes pri-MIR156 degradation independently of canonical NMD..
PMC4702419	Results. . Vegetative profilin single mutants show defects in leaf and inflorescence development. Initially, we characterized single T-DNA insertion mutants for PRF1, PRF2, and PRF3. The prf1-4 allele has an insertion in the first intron 74 bp upstream of the second exon, prf2-1 has an insertion 113 bp upstream of the translational start site in the promoter, and prf3-2 has an insertion at the end of the first exon (Fig.1a). To ensure that the resulting mutant phenotypes were indeed caused by these specific insertions, we constructed lines that were complemented by overexpressing endogenous PRF1, PRF2 or PRF3 cDNAs, respectively, under the control of the constitutive Actin2 promoter and terminator (A2pt). Two or more independent transgenic complementation lines were analyzed.Fig. 1Analysis of mutants defective in individual vegetative profilins. a Schematic drawings indicating the location of each T-DNA insertion in mutant plants prf1-4, prf2-1, and prf3-2. b Visualization of adult plant morphological phenotypes of profilin T-DNA mutants, wild type (WT), and each mutant (prf1-4, prf2-1, prf3-2) complemented with the appropriate transgene (A2P:PRF1, A2:PRF2, and A2:PRF3, respectively).

Leaf measurements (C and D) were taken on day 28 (4w) (n=52) following seed germination, while plant height measurements (E) were taken on day 40 (~5  w) (n=30). All measurements are in mm. Error bars represent +/- 1 SD. **p-value<0.001. *p-value<0.05. The mutant alleles prf1-4 and prf2-1 displayed significant visible defects in rosette leaf and inflorescence development at day 28 after germination as shown in Fig.1b. At this stage prf3-2 plants appeared to have leaves relatively normal except for slightly elongated petioles. The prf1-4 and prf2-1 plants developed leaves that are significantly shorter in total length, width, and blade length (Fig.1c, d and f). All three mutant alleles produced plants that were shorter in overall plant height (Fig.1e), with inflorescences appearing obviously less physically stable in prf2-1 than that of WT (Fig.1b). Pictures of these mutant plants at other stages of development may be seen in the (Additional file 1: Figure S1).. The levels of profilin RNA and protein in these lines were determined using qRT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The monoclonal antibody mAbPRF1a reacts strongly and specifically with PRF1, while mAbPRF12a reacts strongly with PRF1 and PRF2 and only modestly with PRF3 [19]. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed that these mutants had very little or no detectable RNA or protein expression (Fig.2a-b). Although, based on the location of the insertion, prf1-4 is probably not a null allele and may produce some level of RNA, the PRF1 protein expression was below our detection limit. The prf2-1 line has very little vegetative profilin protein and similarly low PRF2 RNA. The prf3-2 line does not show a reduction in protein but a substantial reduction in RNA. Based on the site of insertion prf2-1 and prf3-2 are most likely null for functional profilin protein expression. We also demonstrated that the complement lines contained much higher levels of RNA and protein than WT (Fig.2a-b). While these complemented lines appear to bolt slightly earlier than WT (Fig.1b), no statistically significant phenotypes were observed in these lines overexpressing any of the three vegetative profilins (Fig.1c-e).Fig. 2Analysis of profilin RNA and protein expression for vegetative PRF single T-DNA mutants and complement lines. a The Relative Quantities (RQ) of PRF1 RNA for WT, prf1-4, and A2p:PRF1 plants were determined by quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR). The RQ of PRF2 RNA for WT, prf2-1, and A2p:PRF2 plants and the RQ of PRF3 RNA for WT, prf3-2, and A2p:PRF3 plants are also shown. Error bars represent +/- 1 SD. b Profilin protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis: WT, prf1-4, and A2p:PRF1 plants using the PRF1 specific monoclonal antibody mAbPRF1a; WT, prf2-1, and A2p:PRF2 plants using the PRF1 and PRF2 specific monoclonal antibody mAbPRF12a; WT, prf3-2, and A2p:PRF3 plants using the PRF1 and PRF2 specific monoclonal antibody mAbPRF12a, which also has weak affinity for PRF3. Coomassie stained gels showing rubisco protein expression are located beneath each blot to show equal loading across lanes. All samples were taken from 4w old leaf tissue. To independently confirm the major phenotypes produced by deficiencies in PRF1 and PRF2, we created single RNAi silencing epialleles (PRF1-RNAi and PRF2-RNAi). We developed a new efficient method for constructing RNAi genes that expressed simple stem-loop structures with tetra-adenosine in the loop, to silence RNA expression (see Methods). These stem-loop structures were designed to target and silence the 3-UTR of each gene. A series of epiallelic lines expressing these constructs were isolated. Most of the lines produced morphological phenotypes indistinguishable from the T-DNA insertion mutants. The resulting measurements of leaf length, width, and plant height for selected lines are presented in Additional file 2: Figure S2. qRT-PCR of these epiallelic lines revealed that PRF1 and PRF2 transcript levels were less than 10% of WT (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Unfortunately, we were unable to create a successful, clean RNAi line for PRF3 using various methods.. . . Vegetative profilin double mutants and double/ triple RNAi lines show more severe. . Effects on development. In order to assess both functional redundancy and quantitative effects of the vegetative profilins in Arabidopsis development, three double T-DNA mutants were generated: prf1-4 prf2-1, prf1-4 prf3-2, and prf2-1 prf3-2. The phenotypes shown in Fig.3 make it clear that all three double homozygous mutants exhibit even stronger and more distinct developmental phenotypes than any single PRF1, PRF2, or PRF3 defective plant. The double mutant plants that are noticeably smaller than wild-type (Fig.3a) had leaves that are remarkably shorter in total length, blade length, and width than the wild type (Fig.3b and c) or the single mutants. These defects are seen throughout development (Fig.3a and c). Interestingly, double mutants containing the prf3-2 allele show longer petioles (Fig.3b and c, see the next section). The double mutants are also shorter in overall plant height (Fig.3e).Fig. 3Morphological analysis of vegetative profilin double mutants. a Visualization of morphological phenotypes observed for profilin double T-DNA mutants.

Leaf measurements were taken on day 28 (4w, n=52 for each measurement), while plant height measurements were taken on day 40 (~5  w, n=30). All measurements are in mm. Error bars represent +/- 1 SD. **p value <0.001, *p<0.05. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis (with mAbPRF12a) again revealed that these mutants had very little to no detectable profilin RNA and even more greatly reduced profilin protein expression (Fig.4a and d). Notice how the prf1-4 prf3-2 double mutant had the strongest profilin expression among the three double mutants tested (Fig.4d), which is in agreement with PRF2 being the most highly expressed member of the gene family. prf1-4 prf2-1 had the lowest profilin expression (Fig.4d), consistent with known expression levels for these two genes, and therefore produced the most drastic developmental phenotypes. prf2-1prf3-2 plants also have a faint profilin band, possibly representing PRF1 protein. These data suggested that unlike Arabidopsis vegetative actin ACT7, which is up-regulated in response to deficiencies in ACT2 and ACT8, none of the vegetative profilins were significantly up-regulated in response to profilin deficiency.Fig. 4qRT-PCR data and western blot analysis for double and triple mutant/ RNAi lines.

Coomassie stained gels showing rubisco protein expression are located beneath each blot to show equal loading across lanes. All samples were taken from 4w old leaf tissue. Based on previous studies that silenced four late pollen actins and four Actin Depolymerizing Factors (ADFs) by stacking four different 100 bp 3-UTR sequences in the stem of a stem-loop RNA interference construct [29, 30], we used simplified construct designs (described above) to silence PRF1 and PRF2 (PRF1 PRF2-RNAi), as well as PRF1, PRF2, and PRF3 (PRF1 PRF2 PRF3-RNAi), simultaneously (see Methods). Based on qRT-PCR analysis of profilin transcript levels, we selected independent strongly silenced transgenic lines (#23 and #6 for PRF1 PRF2-RNAi, #26 and #19 for PRF1 PRF2 PRF3-RNAi) and intermediately silenced lines (#11 for PRF1 PRF2-RNAi, #6 for PRF1 PRF2 PRF3-RNAi) for detailed analyses. The strongly silenced lines were severely dwarfed throughout development, with the triple RNAi epiallele showing much more drastic phenotypes than the doubly silenced line or any of the double mutants (Fig.5). qRT-PCR and western blot analysis of these lines show minute levels of RNA and no detectable protein expression (Fig.4b, c, e). The dwarf PRF1 PRF2 PRF3-RNAi plants had fewer siliques that produced hardly any seeds, and the plants were significantly shorter than any of the other single or double mutant lines (Fig.5d). These results indicated that when Arabidopsis plants were deficient in all three vegetative profilins there appears to be a quantitative genetic effect leading to severely dwarfed and less fertile plants. A wide range of tissues and organs were not fully developed (see below for example lateral root and leaf epidermal cell development). Interestingly, the double PRF1 PRF2-RNAi line exhibited slightly more radical phenotypes than the prf1-4 prf2-1 double mutant. Perhaps this is due to a low but barely detectable level of PRF1 expressed in prf1-4 allele. However, by looking at the western blot data (Fig.4d-e) we saw that the PRF1 PRF2-RNAi line had even less protein than the prf1-4 prf2-1 double mutant, which explains the more severe phenotypes.Fig. 5Morphological analysis of PRF double and triple RNAi lines. a The morphology of PRF double and triple RNAi lines (lines silenced for PRF1 and PRF2 and for PRF1-3, respectively) were examined 4 weeks (4w) post-germination. b Leaf length, leaf width, petiole length, and leaf blade length for PRF double and triple RNAi lines. c PRF double and triple RNAi plants show severe morphological phenotypes at 5 weeks (5w). d Mature plant height for double and triple RNAi lines. Leaf measurements were taken on day 28 (4w) during development (n=52), while plant height measurements were taken on day 40 (~5  w, n=30). All measurements are in mm. Error bars represent +/- 1 SD. **p value <0.001, *p<0.05. . . PRF3 deficient plants exhibit slightly elongated petioles. While PRF3 deficient plants did not seem to display the strongly dwarfed leaf phenotype similar to plants deficient in PRF1 or PRF2, they did exhibit elongated petioles compared to WT (Fig.6a). The elongated petiole phenotype can be seen in all plant lines that have the PRF3 gene knocked down (prf3-2, prf1-4 prf3-2, and prf2-1 prf3-2), with the exception of PRF1 PRF2 PRF3-RNAi plant lines whose leaves and petioles were so dwarfed that this difference was not statistically significant (Figs.3b, 5b, and 6a). Previous experiments using PRF3 promoter-GUS fusion constructs confirmed that PRF3 was being expressed in petioles [31]. Our data suggest that PRF3 may play a distinct role in petiole development.Fig. 6PRF3 knockout displays elongated petioles, while PRF3 overexpression results in no phenotypic effects. a Petiole length for vegetative PRF T-DNA mutant prf3-2 and its complement lines. b Day 14 primary root length comparison between WT, prf3-2, and three independent A2p:PRF3 overexpression lines. c Day 10 hypocotyl length comparison between WT, prf3-2, and three independent A2p:PRF3 overexpression lines.

Leaf measurements (a) were taken on day 28 (4w) during development, primary root length measurements (d) were taken on day 15, and hypocotyl length measurements (e) were taken on day 10. All measurements are in mm. Leaf measurements were generated with a sample of n=52, while root and hypocotyls measurements have an n=30. Error bars represent +/- 1 SD. *p value<0.05. . . PRF3 overexpression analysis. Multiple independent PRF3 overexpression lines were analyzed by growing them vertically on plates containing 0.5 MS salts and 1% sucrose germination media, yielding no phenotypic result (Fig.6b). Three independent A2p:PRF3 overexpression lines showed 8 to 20-fold increases in PRF3 transcript expression (Fig.6f). Two lines examined, #1 and #3, with immunochemical staining of a Western blot with mAbPRF12a monoclonal antibody, showed about 1.6 and 2x higher levels of total profilin over WT (Fig.6g). Considering that this antibody recognizes PRF3 more weakly than PRF1 or 2, these Western data suggest the actual levels of profilin protein may be significantly higher in these lines. Despite previously published data indicating that the overexpression of PRF3 causes stunted roots [31]; we saw no related phenotype in our PRF3 overexpression lines (Fig.6b). In addition, no effects were seen on hypocotyl development in PRF3 overexpression plants (Fig.6c). These contrasting phenotypic results could be due to differences in how PRF3 was overexpressed. PRF3 RNA expression levels in these lines were demonstrated using qRT-PCR (Fig.6f). Western blot analysis was unable to clearly determine the extent of PRF3 protein present, since PRF3 represents such a small part of total profilin expression, and because mAbPRF12a reacts stronger with the more highly expressed PRF1 and PRF2 proteins than PRF3 (Fig.6g). For this reason we rely more on our qRT-PCR analysis for gauging PRF3 levels. A complete list of phenotypic measurements for all plant lines is presented in Additional file 3: Table S1.. . . Vegetative profilins are essential to lateral root initiation. We grew all mutant and epiallele plant lines vertically in plates on germination media containing 0.5 MS salts and 1% sucrose to look for defects in root growth. Most single profilin-deficient lines showed no significant root growth and lateral root formation phenotypes (not shown). However, the RNAi lines lacking PRF1 and PRF2, the two most highly expressed profilins, had normal primary roots (Fig.7a and b), but the lateral roots were slightly shorter than wild type as shown in Fig.7a and d. However, multiple PRF1 PRF2 PRF3-RNAi plant lines revealed severe lateral root phenotypes. They formed primary roots of normal length, but showed drastic differences in their lateral root initiation and architecture (Fig.7a, b, c). They not only produce a lower numbers of lateral roots (Fig.7c), but these lateral roots were also much shorter (Fig.7d), indicating that there could likely be a problem in cell elongation among these lateral roots. Root architecture of the intermediately silenced PRF1 PRF2-RNAi and PRF1 PRF2 PRF3-RNAi epialleles revealed intermediate phenotypes that appear proportional to PRF expression levels (Additional file 4: Figure S3). While primary root length appears slightly longer in the two intermediately silenced PRF1 PRF2-RNAi lines shown, they were not statistically significant (not shown).Fig. 7Vegetative profilin double and triple RNAi lines show defects in lateral root formation and growth. a Visualization of defects in root development for PRF double and triple RNAi lines. b Quantification of primary root length. c Quantification of the number of lateral roots formed/ initiated. d Quantification of lateral root length.

PMC3212813	Results. Two highly homologous cDNAs coding for putative NDR1 proteins were identified and cloned from leaves of coffee plants. One of the candidate coding sequences was then expressed in the Arabidopsis knock-out null mutant ndr1-1. Upon a challenge with a specific strain of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae (DC3000::AvrRpt2), analysis of both macroscopic symptoms and in planta microbial growth showed that the coffee cDNA was able to restore the resistance phenotype in the mutant genetic background. Thus, the cDNA was dubbed CaNDR1a (standing for Coffea arabica Non-race specific Disease Resistance 1a). Finally, biochemical and microscopy data were obtained that strongly suggest the mechanistic conservation of the NDR1-driven function within coffee and Arabidopsis plants. Using a transient expression system, it was indeed shown that the CaNDR1a protein, like its Arabidopsis counterpart, is localized to the plasma membrane, where it is possibly tethered by means of a GPI anchor..
PMC4406451	Results. . Early and late generations of ddm1 mutants show distinct genomic DNA methylation patterns. To understand the changes in DNA methylation patterns during self-pollinations of ddm1 mutant genome-wide, we compared DNA methylation before and after the self-pollination of the mutant. We examined DNA methylation in four individuals of ddm1 homozygous mutants segregated in progeny of a heterozygote (hereafter called 1G for the 1st Generation) and also four lines of ddm1 plants independently self-pollinated eight times (hereafter called 9G) (S1 Fig). In 1G, the ddm1 mutation already induced reduction of DNA methylation in heterochromatic regions [10,25,26]. Methylation in repetitive sequences, such as transposable elements (TEs) (Fig 1D-1F), was much more severely affected than that in low copy sequences, such as genes (Fig 1A-1C). The reduction was found for both CG sites (Fig 1A and 1D) and non-CG sites. In non-CG sites, both CHG sites (Fig 1B and 1E) and CHH sites (Fig 1C and 1F) were affected (H can be A, T, or C). When we compared average DNA methylation of 9G to 1G, two features were noted for both genes and TEs: further decrease of CG methylation and an increased methylation at non-CG sites (Fig 1).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005154.g001. Fig 1. . DNA methylation in ddm1 mutants before and after repeated self-pollination.. DNA methylation patterns of WT, 1G ddm1, and 9G ddm1 mutants for cellular genes (A-C) or genes within transposable elements (transposable element genes, or TEGs, D-F). WT is a DDM1/DDM1 plant segregating as a sibling of the 1G ddm1/ddm1 plants. The black bars in the bottom represent transcribed regions. A chromosome-wide view of DNA methylation is also shown in S2 Fig.. . . . . . Progressive reduction of CG methylation in the self-pollinated ddm1 lines. Although the ddm1 mutation immediately induces a drastic loss of DNA methylation in repeats, further reduction of methylation in later generations has been reported for a few CG sites [30]. Our genome-wide analysis revealed that many loci behave in a similar manner (Fig 2A). The progressive reduction of DNA methylation can have significant phenotypic effects; for example, the promoter of the imprinted gene FWA remains methylated in the 1G ddm1 but the methylation is lost stochastically in 9G ddm1 (Fig 2B), generating heritable epialleles that cause late-flowering phenotype [31,36,38]. The progressive reduction is seen genome-wide for both genes and TEs (Fig 1A and 1D).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005154.g002. Fig 2. . Change of CG methylation during self-pollination of ddm1 mutants.. (A) CG methylation level compared for each transcription unit. Each dot represents the DNA methylation level in a gene (black dot) or a transposable element gene (TEG, red dot). The top half shows effects in four different 1G ddm1 plants, while the bottom half shows effects in four different 9G ddm1 plants. Each of the 9G plants was originated from independent self-pollinations. Comparison of the 9G ddm1 plants to independently self-pollinated 9G DDM1 plants (S1 Fig) is shown in S3 Fig. WT is a DDM1/DDM1 plant segregating as a sibling of the 1G ddm1/ddm1 plants. (B, C) Genome browser views of loci with CG methylation reduced in 9G ddm1 using the Integrated Genome Browser [74]. FWA locus (B) and AT2G04350 locus (C) are shown. The FWA gene has dense CG methylation around the 5 end, which is lost during self-pollination of the ddm1 mutant. (D) H3K9me2 level of differently hypo-methylated regions (hypo-DMRs) in CG context. Left (1G - WT): Distribution of 119,883 DMRs between WT and 1G ddm1 mutant. Center (9G - specific): Distribution of 25,861 DMRs between WT and 9G ddm1, excluding DMRs between WT and 1G ddm1. Distribution of 100,000 randomly chosen 100 bp regions is also shown as a control (right). H3K9me2 level of wild type is shown by reads per million (RPM) in ChIP-seq data obtained from GEO (GSE28398 [72]). (E) Change in CG methylation level in 1G ddm1 (left) and 9G ddm1 (right) from wild type, plotted against enrichment of H3K9me2 in wild type (data from Inagaki et al. 2010).. . . . To compare the features of the regions hypomethylated immediately or gradually, we defined differentially methylated regions (DMRs; details in Materials and Methods). The regions ddm1 affects immediately (1G-WT DMRs) were enriched in dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) (Fig 2D left and 2E). H3K9me2 is a mark of silent heterochromatin, and these results are consistent with previous reports [10,26]. In marked contrast, however, regions affected slowly (9G-specific DMRs) have much lower level of H3K9me2 in wild type (Fig 2D middle). DDM1 gene function is necessary for CG methylation in heterochromatin, but in the long-term DDM1 also has significant effects on CG methylation in less heterochromatic regions including gene bodies (Fig 2C).. . . Accumulation of non-CG methylation in ddm1 lines after propagation by self-pollination. More counter-intuitively, our genome-wide analysis revealed a large number of genes and TEs ectopically hypermethylated at non-CG sites in the self-pollinated ddm1 lines (Figs 3A, 3B, 4A and 5A-5E). The regions CHG hypermethylated also showed hypermethylation at CHH sites (Figs 3D, 5A-5D, and S6A Fig). In addition, although genic CG methylation tends to decrease progressively from 1G to 9G on average (Figs 1 and 2), non-CG hypermethylated regions show an increase in CG methylation (Fig 3D). The CG and non-CG hypermethylation was found reproducibly at specific loci (S8 Fig). The affected loci include BONSAI and other sequences we have reported previously [37,39], but the majority of the affected loci could only be detected by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), because that can detect increased non-CG methylation with high sensitivity even at loci already CG methylated. In addition to genes, a large number of TEs showed increase in non-CG methylation (Figs 3A,3B, 4E, and S9-S11 Figs).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005154.g003. Fig 3. . Change of non-CG methylation during self-pollination of ddm1 mutants.. (A, B) Effects of 1G and 9G ddm1 mutation on CHG methylation (A) and CHH methylation (B). The format is as shown for CG sites in Fig 2A. Comparison of the 9G ddm1 plants to independently self-pollinated 9G DDM1 plants is shown in S3 Fig. (C) The number of genes that gained non-CG methylation in ddm1 mutant (methylation level < 0.1 in WT and  0.1 in ddm1). Results for the four 1G and four 9G of ddm1 mutants are shown for CHG and CHH sites. (D) Coordinated hypermethylation of CG, CHG and CHH sites. Genes CHG-hypermethylated in 9G ddm1 are those with methylation level < 0.1 in 1G ddm1 and  0.1 in 9G ddm1. DNA methylation levels for three contexts are shown for WT, 1G ddm1, and 9G ddm1. On the right, total genes are shown as controls. Although CHG hypermethylated genes tend to have more CG methylation in wild type, the body methylation is not an absolute requirement; even genes without CG methylation occasionally non-CG hypermethylated in 9G ddm1 (S4 Fig). Pattern of CG methylation change from 1G ddm1 to 9G ddm1 is further characterized in S5 Fig.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005154.g004. Fig 4. . . BONSAI hypermethylation in self-pollinated ddm1 mutants is associated with H3K9 methylation.. (A) Genome browser views of CHH and CHG methylation in AT1G73177 (BONSAI) locus. (B) H2K9me detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP). input is the sample before IP; mock denotes samples after IP procedure without antibody. H3mK9me1 and H3K9me2 are samples after IP with the respective antibodies. Amplified regions around the BONSAI locus are indicated in (A). LINE and ACT2 are used as positive and negative controls, respectively. 11G plants are the ddm1 mutants in the 11th generation. 11G #1 and 11G #3 samples are prepared from progenies of direct sibling of 9G ddm1 #1 and #3 plants (shown in A), respectively. Results for other loci are shown in S6 and S7 Figs. Although the BONSAI locus accumulated both CHG and CHH methylation, some of the CHG hypermethylated loci have less CHH methylation than others (S6A Fig). In our preliminary analyses, H3K9me1 is more prevalent in those loci than H3K9me2 (S6 and S7 Figs).. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005154.g005. Fig 5. . Spread of non-CG methylation in self-pollinated ddm1 mutants.. (A-E) Genome browser views of loci with non-CG methylation in the 9G ddm1 plants. AT5G16880 (A-B), AT3G06480 (C-D), and AT4G07518 loci (E) are shown for CHG (A, C) and CHH (B, D, E) contexts. Direction of transcription is shown by an arrow in A-D. (F) Histogram of correlation coefficient between the CHG methylation level and the relative centroid position of CHG methylation within the DMR. The centroid position was determined by averaging relative position of the methylated cytosine weighed with the methylation level for each residue. The coefficient was calculated among the four 9G ddm1 plants in each conDMR for CHG methylation between 9G and 1G ddm1 (details in Materials and Methods section) overlapping with genes. The coefficient becomes negative when the centroid moves to the 5 regions as the average level of CHG methylation in the conDMR increase. A large proportion of the contiguous DMRs with the coefficient near -1 reflects spread of CHG methylation from 3 to 5 regions as the CHG methylation levels increase.. . . . A very unexpected feature revealed by WGBS is that non-CG hypermethylation of genes is almost undetectable in the first generation of ddm1 but is specifically and reproducibly seen in the repeatedly self-pollinated ddm1 lines. In Fig 3A and 3B, many black dots can be seen along the vertical axis in the panels for 9G but not for 1G. The non-CG hypermethylation of genes is not a simple extension of the effect seen in the first generation. This feature can only be detected in later generations (Fig 3C). In order to further understand the transgenerational dynamics, we examined four independently self-pollinated 2G ddm1 plants. If the hypermethylation proceeds equally at each self-pollination, the increase from 1G to 2G would be 1/8 or more of the increase from 1G to 9G, provided that the methylation level should saturate at specific level (the methylation level can not exceed 100%). Interestingly, although hypermethylation proceeded in 2G, the difference between 1G and 2G was much less than 1/8 of that between 1G and 9G, suggesting that the increase is slow initially but accelerated in later generations (S12 and S13 Figs).. . . Spread of H3K9me and non-CG methylation in ddm1 mutants. How is this non-CG hypermethylation induced? Our genome-wide bisulfite analyses revealed that the genes non-CG hypermethylated in the self-pollinated ddm1 tend to have low levels of non-CG methylation already in wild type plants (Fig 3D), suggesting that preexisting small heterochromatin domains may function as seed for further heterochromatin formation. Interestingly, distribution of H3K9me2 around the DMR is asymmetric; it is enriched in the 3 of the DMRs (S14 Fig). We have previously shown that the BONSAI gene is flanked by insertion of a heterochromatic LINE in the 3 region [37] (Fig 4A and S13A Fig). The BONSAI hypermethylation in ddm1 is induced in a strain with the LINE insertion but not found in a strain without the LINE insertion [37]. The DNA methylation spreads from the 3 LINE to the BONSAI region during repeated self-pollination of ddm1 mutants [37]. Spread of non-CG methylation from 3 to 5 regions was also noted at other loci (Fig 5A-5D). When the methylation level differs among the four 9G ddm1 plants, plants with stronger signals tended to show relative centroid positions more upstream than plants with weaker signals, suggesting that the signal spreads from 3 to 5 (Fig 5F). These observations suggest that common mechanisms may operate in BONSAI and many, even if not all, affected loci.. We have previously shown that the de novo non-CG methylation in the self-pollinated ddm1 does not require components of the RdDM machinery, such as RDR2, DCL3, and DRM2 [39]. On the other hand, the non-CG methylase CMT3 and H3K9 methylase KYP are necessary for the de novo methylation, suggesting that the ectopic methylation occurs by mechanisms mediated by the heterochromatin marks H3K9me and non-CG methylation [39]. Indeed, the non-CG hypermethylation at the BONSAI locus is associated with ectopic H3K9me (Fig 4B).. The self-reinforcing loop of non-CG methylase and H3K9 methylase activities could be the basis for the acceleration of hypermethylation as the generation proceeds (S13B Fig). As the two processes enhance each other, the positive feedback would accelerate the spread of the heterochromatin in later generations [12, 13].. . . Properties of loci hypermethylated in the self-pollinated ddm1. . Increased non-CG methylation has been reported in mutants of the CG methyltransferase gene MET1 [40-42], which results at least in part from a reduction of full-length IBM1 transcript [43]. The IBM1 gene encodes a demethylase for histone H3K9; and mutation in this gene induces accumulation of H3K9me2 and non-CG methylation in gene bodies. Interestingly, developmental phenotypes of the ibm1 mutation also become progressively stronger during self-pollinations [15]. We compared the regions of non-CG hypermethylation in the ibm1 and self-pollinated ddm1. Although an overlap can be detected, the majority of the DMRs in ddm1 mutants before and after the self-pollinations were distinct from the DMRs of ibm1 mutants (Fig 6B and S16 Fig). Just as progressive loss of CG methylation in the ddm1 mutant, ibm1 mutant shows progressive accumulation of non-CG methylation in later generations (Fig 6A, S15 and S16 Figs). This is consistent with a recent report [44] and likely accounts for the progressive developmental defects in the ibm1 mutant.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005154.g006. Fig 6. . Hypermethylated regions in ddm1 and ibm1 mutants.. (A) Increase of CHG methylation in 1G and 3G ibm1 mutants. Genes hypermethylated in 1G ibm1 (CHG methylation level < 0.1 in WT and  0.1 in 1G ibm1) are shown (right) with total genes (left). Profiles for multiple 1G and 3G ibm1 mutant plants are shown in S15 Fig. (B) Comparison of regions CHG hypermethylated in ibm1 and 9G ddm1. DMRs between 9G and 1G ddm1 (blue), between 1G ibm1 and WT (orange), and between 3G ibm1 and WT (red) are shown. Heat map of CHG methylation for these DMRs are shown in S16B Fig. (C) DNA methylation profile for the genes CHG hyper-methylated in 9G ddm1 (shown in Fig 3D). The top and bottom half represent genes and TEGs, respectively. In these regions, CHH methylation also increased in 9G ddm1.. . . . We examined DNA methylation patterns of the genes and TEs hypermethylated in the self-pollinated ddm1 lines (Fig 6C). Compared to the ibm1 mutant, the peak in the ddm1 was shifted toward 3 end. Interestingly, the shift of the peak in the hypermethylation was also found for CG methylation (S5D Fig). Although CG methylation of gene body in wild type peaks around the center (S5C Fig), increase of genic CG methylation in 9G ddm1 was not proportional to the methylation of wild type; instead, the increase of CG methylation was shifted toward 3 regions (S5D Fig). Together with the observation that CHG-hypermethylated genes tend to show CG-hypermethylation (Fig 3D), these results suggest a link between the ectopic CG methylation and non-CG methylation, as we discussed previously [39].. The bias of the hypermethylation signal toward the 3 region in 9G ddm1 is especially evident in the hypermethylated TEs; the peak was often located outside of the transcription unit for both CHG and CHH methylations (Fig 6C, bottom half). When different families of TEs are compared, the peak in the downstream region was especially evident in the GYPSY-like LTR retrotransposons (S10 Fig). Generally, these TEs lost DNA methylation in 1G ddm1, but regained methylation during the self-pollinations (S5A and S9-S11 Figs).. . . The hypomethylated chromosomes from a ddm1 mutant could induce hypermethylation in trans even in a DDM1 wild type background. The ddm1 mutation can induce increased DNA methylation at hundreds of genes and TEs. The hypermethylation can be a direct consequence of impaired DDM1 function, or alternatively, an indirect effect of disruption of heterochromatin in the mutants. To test these possibilities, we examined the effect of chromosomes introduced from ddm1 into wild type DDM1 background. Chromosomes losing DNA methylation in the ddm1 mutants remain unmethylated even after introduction into wild type DDM1 background [25,45]. We examined DNA methylation data of epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) [46]. In the epiRILs, a ddm1 mutant plant was crossed to wild type plant twice to segregate DDM1/DDM1 lines with around one quarter of chromosome segments derived from ddm1. Although remethylation can be induced in regions associated with small RNA, hundreds of DMRs remain unmethylated in the wild type DDM1 background [46,47]. Each of these segregating lines have been self-pollinated seven times, which makes most of the genomic regions fixed in ddm1-derived haplotype or wild-type derived haplotype [46].. We examined if the loci exhibiting hypermethylation in the self-pollinated ddm1 lines also showed hypermethylation in some of the epiRILs. We utilized DNA methylation data for the 123 epiRILs, which are based on immunoprecipitation (IP) of genomic DNA by anti-methylcytosine antibody. As the context of methylation cannot be distinguished, we examined seven loci that show increased methylation in 9G ddm1 but a relatively low level of methylation at CG sites in wild-type. In six out of the seven loci examined, we could detect hypermethylation in multiple epiRILs, suggesting that the hypermethylation can be induced or maintained in the DDM1 background (Figs 7A, 7C, 7E and S17 Fig). In all of them, the hypermethylation showed a strong positive correlation with the amount of disrupted heterochromatin in each of these lines (Fig 7, S17 Fig and S1 Table), suggesting that the hypermethylation was induced or maintained in the background of disrupted heterochromatin in other genomic regions.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005154.g007.

In each panel, the chromosome including the target locus (arrowhead) is shown. Haplotypes of all five chromosomes are shown in S18-S23 Figs. The filled circles indicate centromere positions. The haplotypes are predicted from stably hypomethylated markers [46]. The regions not covered by any markers are indicated in gray. Names of epiRILs numbered 1-6 in each panel are in Materials and Methods. Data of epiRILs were obtained from GEO (GSE37284 [46]).. . . . The hypermethylation could be induced de novo or alternatively maintained from the parental ddm1. The parental ddm1 plant originally used for making epiRILs was already self-pollinated three times (4G) and that plant also show low level of ectopic methylation at some loci (S17 Fig), which may have the potential to be maintained in DDM1 background [37]. Very importantly, however, the hypermethylation was found even in chromosome segments originated from wild type DDM1 (Figs 7B, 7D, 7F and S18-S23 Figs), demonstrating that the hypermethylation could be induced de novo after the initial crosses and subsequent repeated self-pollinations in the background of functional DDM1.. In order to confirm and extend this observation, we used WGBS for an epiRIL with genome-wide reduction of heterochromatic DNA methylation. The epiRIL98, which contains large amount of chromosomes with reduced DNA methylation, showed CHG hypermethylation in many genes (Fig 8A), which include BONSAI gene (S24A Fig) and genes with body methylation (S24B-S24C Fig). In the CHG hypermethylated genes, the CHG methylation level was generally much higher than that of the parental 4G ddm1 plant (Fig 8B), suggesting that the hypermethylation was amplified or induced de novo in the background of functional DDM1. A large number of CHG hypermethylated genes were found in chromosome regions of wild type haplotype (Fig 8C and S25 Fig), again suggesting that they can be induced de novo. In control epiRILs with much lower levels of disrupted chromatin, the hypermethylation was undetectable, confirming that the disrupted heterochromatin was responsible (Fig 8A). Taken together, these results indicate that the hypermethylation can be induced de novo by trans-acting effects of disrupted heterochromatin.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005154.g008. Fig 8. .

PMC2837260	Results. . Identification of Arabidopsis mutants with delayed leaf senescence. Arabidopsis, a representative monocarpic plant, is a favoured model for molecular and genetic studies of leaf senescence because its leaves readily undergo easily distinguishable developmental stages and show a well-defined and reproducible senescence programme (Hensel et al., 1993). Arabidopsis populations mutagenized with EMS for delayed leaf senescence mutants were screened, which allowed us to identify positive elements of senescence. Initial screening was carried out by visual evaluation of the degree of yellowing caused by chlorophyll loss when detached leaves were incubated in the dark. This technique is widely used for the consistent acceleration of leaf senescence (Oh et al., 1997). One of the mutants, ore14-1, which exhibited a delayed leaf senescence phenotype, was selected for further study. This mutation has a pleiotropic effect on vegetative and reproductive development, including the increased growth of aerial organs, inhibited floral bud opening, late flowering, and a delay in stem senescence (Fig. 1). These traits co-segregated with the delayed leaf senescence phenotype (data not shown). Genetic segregation analysis of the senescence phenotype was performed in F1 and F2 progeny derived from crosses between wild-type plants and the ore14-1 mutant. All F1 plants had normal phenotypes, including senescence symptoms, demonstrating that the ore14-1 mutation is recessive. In the F2 generation, 99 plants exhibiting wild-type phenotypes and 29 mutant plants were scored, indicative of 3:1 segregation (chi2=0.37, P >0.05). This showed that the mutation is inherited as a monogenic recessive trait.. . Fig. 1.. . Whole-plant phenotypes of Arabidopsis wild-type (Col, left) and ore14-1 mutant (right) plants at 35, 46, and 65 d after germination (DAG).. . . . Another mutant, ore14-2, with a phenotype similar to that of the ore14-1 mutant was also isolated. Genetic complementation tests revealed that these two mutations were in fact allelic (data not shown).. . . ORE14 is allelic to ARF2, which encodes an auxin response factor. The gene responsible for the ore14-1 mutation was identified by map-based cloning (Fig. 2A). An initial genetic mapping, with CAPS markers, located ORE14 close to the LFY locus on Chromosome 5. CAPS markers were also generated using the genomic sequences of bacterial artificial chromosome clones (Fig. 2A). Among 1391 F2 progeny, one and two recombinant chromosomes were observed for the markers MTG10-M and K22G18-A, respectively. These mapping data located ORE14 at approximately 0.03 cM and 0.07 cM from these respective markers (Fig. 2A). The wild-type and mutant nucleotide sequences for the region around the map location of ORE14 were then compared. A single base change in the ore14-1 mutant-a G to A substitution-was identified at position 1673 from the translational start of the gene At5g62000 (Fig. 2B), which encodes auxin response factor 2 (ARF2). This mutation was expected to result in a premature stop codon at position 558 (Trpstop) in the ARF2 protein. The same region was then sequenced from the ore14-2 mutant and it was found that a mutation here led to an early termination of translation at position 115 (Argstop) (Fig. 2B). Although the levels of ARF2 transcript of both mutants were comparable to that of wild-type plants (data not shown), these mutations probably cause a complete loss of function through premature translation termination. We simultaneously investigated a T-DNA insertion line in the At5g62000 gene, Salk_041472 line (arf2-5). The arf2-5 plants also exhibited phenotypes similar to those with the ore14 mutation, including delayed leaf senescence (data not shown). Several arf2 alleles were previously identified and designated as arf2-1 to arf2-9 (Ellis et al., 2005; Schruff et al., 2006); the ore14-1 and ore14-2 alleles are arf2-10 and arf2-11, respectively.. .

(B) Schematic representation of ORE14 with positions of the ore14-1 and 14-2 mutations; B3, DNA binding domain; ARF, auxin response region; AUX/IAA, domain involved in dimerization with other ARFs or Aux/IAA.. . . . Auxin response factor 2 (ARF2) belongs to a family of transcription factors that bind to auxin-responsive elements (AuxREs) in the promoters of auxin-regulated genes (Ulmasov et al., 1997). In previous studies utilizing T-DNA insertion lines, the ARF2 gene was suggested to play a role in several developmental processes, such as cell division, organ growth, flowering, senescence, and abscission (Ellis et al., 2005; Okushima et al., 2005a; Schruff et al., 2006). However, the effect of ARF2 on leaf senescence has not been extensively examined. This led us to examine further the phenotype of the ore14/arf2 mutant with several senescence parameters under various senescence induction conditions.. . . The ore14/arf2 mutant exhibits extended leaf longevity during age-dependent senescence. The senescence symptoms of the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant were first examined in detail during age-dependent in planta senescence. For an accurate assay, two factors were considered. First, in our experiment, leaf senescence was measured on a single leaf base with its age information. Measuring senescence parameters with a mixture of several leaves at a given plant age is not a valid analysis for leaf senescence, since the individual leaves of a plant have different ages. Only the third and fourth rosette leaves of a given plant were used here. The emergence time and growth rate of the fourth leaf was almost identical in wild-type plants and the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant. Second, the senescence symptom was measured with various parameters that cover various aspects of senescence physiology.. Leaf yellowing is a convenient visible indicator, mainly reflecting the chloroplast senescence of mesophyll cells. Age-dependent leaf yellowing using the fourth rosette leaf of mutant and wild-type plants were examined first. Wild-type leaves started to turn yellow at the leaf age of 20 d. Leaf age here means the age of the leaf under assay, counting from its visible emergence. After 20 d, yellowing gradually spread to the whole leaf. Wild-type leaves finally showed signs of necrosis at the age of 36 d (Fig. 3A). By contrast, ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant leaves started to turn yellow at the age of 28 d, i.e. 8 d later than wild-type leaves. They progressed more slowly, so that complete yellowing was not seen in the mutant until 44 d after emergence (DAE). Even then, however, the integrity of the mutant leaf shape was still maintained (Fig. 3A). When the point was determined at which the survival of the entire leaf population per plant was 50%, it was found that the leaf longevity of the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant was extended by 35%, from 26 DAE to 35 DAE (Fig. 3B).. . Fig. 3.. . Extended leaf longevity in ore14/arf2 mutants. (A) Age-dependent senescence phenotype of the third and fourth rosette leaves of wild-type (Col) and ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant plants at different ages. The photographs show representative leaves at each time point. (B) Survival curve. Values indicate the percentage of leaves alive on a given day after emergence (DAE). n=100. (C-E) Chlorophyll content (C), photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of PSII (D), and membrane ion leakage (E) were measured from the third and fourth leaves starting at 12 DAE, when leaves had just reached full growth. Error bars indicate standard deviation (SD, n=30). (F) Age-dependent changes in gene expression. Total cellular RNAs isolated at the indicated ages were probed with CAB, RBCS, SEN4, and SAG12.. . . . Symptoms of age-dependent senescence were then quantitatively investigated by measuring changes in several parameters, such as chlorophyll content, photochemical efficiency, membrane ion leakage, and the expression of senescence-associated genes. Chlorophyll amounts in wild-type leaves started to decrease rapidly after 20 DAE. By the age of 28 d, the chlorophyll content was reduced to 27% of that of 12 DAE leaves (mature green stage). By contrast, losses in the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant were slower, with 52% of its chlorophyll remaining at 36 DAE (Fig. 3C). The change in the photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of PSII was also monitored as an index of functional leaf senescence (Oh et al., 1997). As shown in Fig. 3D, the photochemical efficiency of wild-type leaves declined to 38% by the age of 32 d, whereas that of ore14-1/arf2-10 leaves remained almost unchanged until the age of 32 d and declined only to 39%, even at the age of 44 d. This showed that the functional integrity of PSII was maintained much longer in mutant leaves. Similar observations were made for these two parameters with the ore14-2/arf2-11 mutant (Fig. 3C, D). Senescence also involves the disruption of plasma membrane integrity as the final step in cell death. This can be conveniently quantified by monitoring ion leakage. It was found that leaf senescence was delayed in the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant, as shown by slower increases in membrane ion leakage of the leaves with aging (Fig. 3E).. Moreover, in the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant, a photosynthesis-related chlorophyll a/b-binding protein gene (CAB) and a ribulose biphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene (RBCS) were expressed at higher levels at the later stages, while the induction of two senescence-associated genes, SEN4 and SAG12, was delayed (Fig. 3F). These results indicated that the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutation considerably extends leaf longevity and delays leaf senescence, controlling various senescence-associated physiological and molecular symptoms. Thus, these results suggest that ORE14/ARF2 plays an important role in regulating the leaf senescence process.. . . Delays in artificially induced senescence. Darkness is one of the most potent external stimuli that accelerate leaf senescence. The responses were compared of the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant and wild-type plants during dark-induced senescence. To minimize developmental effects, fully grown third and fourth leaves were detached at 12 DAE (mature green stage). Those from the wild-type plants lost 90% of their chlorophyll after 6 d of dark incubation. However, for the mutant, the chlorophyll content declined much more slowly; even after 6 d, over 70% was retained (Fig. 4A, B). Measurement of the photochemical efficiency showed that, after 8 d of incubation, ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant leaves still maintained over 65% of their initial PSII activity, while wild-type leaves completely lost this activity (Fig. 4C). A relatively slower increase in membrane ion leakage in the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant was also observed (Fig. 4D). Consistent with these physiological data, the induction level of SEN4, a molecular marker for dark-induced senescence, was much lower in the mutant during dark incubation (Fig. 4E).. . Fig. 4.. . Delayed leaf senescence of ore14/arf2 mutants during dark-induced senescence. (A) Phenotypes of wild-type and ore14 mutant leaves. The third and fourth rosette leaves were detached at the age of 12 d and incubated in darkness; DAT, days after treatment. (B-D) Chlorophyll content (B), photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of PSII (C), and membrane ion leakage (D) were examined every 2 d after dark treatment. Error bars indicate SD (n=24). (E) Expression of SEN4. Total cellular RNAs were isolated from wild-type and ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant leaves at the days indicated.. . . . It was then tested whether the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutation affects phytohormone-induced leaf senescence. Three hormones in particular-ABA, MJ, and ethylene- strongly hasten leaf senescence (He et al., 2001; Woo et al., 2001; Lim et al., 2007b). Before examining hormone-induced leaf senescence symptoms, the effect of light alone was evaluated first as a control experiment. When detached leaves were exposed to light in the presence of MES buffer alone, no significant changes in chlorophyll content and PSII activity in wild-type or mutant leaves were observed (Fig. 5A). To determine whether ORE14/ARF2 is involved in the senescence process induced by senescence-accelerating phytohormones, the senescence symptoms of the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant were examined after treatment with these hormones. When detached leaves were treated with MJ, ABA, or ethylene, a rapid decrease in chlorophyll was observed in wild-type leaves and, 5 d after incubation, the chlorophyll of wild-type leaves was reduced to less than 20%. However, ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant leaves retained more than 80% of chlorophyll following treatment with these hormones at 5 d after incubation (Fig. 5B-D). A similar pattern was observed when PSII activity was measured. These data clearly showed a delay of leaf senescence in the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant during plant hormone-accelerated senescence. These results imply that ORE14/ARF2 might be a regulator in controlling the senescence process modulated by these hormones, as well as in age-dependent and dark-induced senescence.. . Fig. 5.. . Delay of leaf senescence in the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant during senescence accelerated by phytohormones. The third and fourth rosette leaves were detached at the age of 12 d and incubated under continuous light in MES buffer alone (A), with 50 muM ACC (B), 100 muM MJ (C), or 50 muM ABA (D). Chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency are presented as average percent values SD, relative to those of leaves incubated in light; n=24. DAT, days after treatment.. . . . . . Resistance of the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant to oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species play a critical role in mediating oxidative damage and accelerating senescence in a variety of organisms (Reilly et al., 2004). Potential life spans are positively correlated with plant tolerance to oxidative stress. The oxidative stress tolerance of the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant was therefore assessed. For this experiment, the procedure that was used for assaying phytohormone-induced senescence symptoms was adapted and hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidant. Under such exposure, both chlorophyll content and PSII activity declined rapidly in the wild type. By contrast, the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant retained over 80% of its chlorophyll and 95% of the original PSII activity, even at 5 d after treatment (Fig. 6A, B). Thus, the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutation conferred greater resistance to oxidative stress, one of the major determinants of senescence. These results further indicate that ORE14/ARF2 might be a central regulator of leaf senescence. The data also support our previous finding that oxidative stress tolerance is linked to the control of leaf longevity (Woo et al., 2004).. . Fig. 6.. . Delay of leaf senescence in the ore14-1 mutant during senescence accelerated by oxidative stress. The third and fourth rosette leaves were detached at the age of 12 d and incubated under continuous light in MES buffer alone (A) and with 15 mM hydrogen peroxide (B). Chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency are presented as average per cent values SD, relative to those of leaves incubated in light (n=24). DAT, days after treatment.. . . . . . ARF2 is a repressor of auxin signalling. The ARF family of transcription factors regulates many responses to auxin. These proteins bind to auxin response elements in the promoters of auxin-regulated genes and activate or repress transcription (Ulmasov et al., 1997). Most ARFs have three domains: an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a C-terminal dimerization domain, and a middle region (MR) that activates or represses transcription (Ulmasov et al., 1999). ARFs containing glutamine-rich MRs, for example, ARF5 and ARF19, function as activators of auxin-responsive gene expression in vivo (Nagpal et al., 2005; Okushima et al., 2005b; Wilmoth et al., 2005) and in transiently transfected protoplasts (Ulmasov et al., 1999). By contrast, ARFs containing proline- and/or serine-rich MRs, such as ARF1 and ARF2, have been suggested to repress auxin-responsive gene expression in protoplast transient assays (Tiwari et al., 2003, 2004).. To test whether ARF2 represses auxin signalling in vivo, the growth responses of ore14-1/arf2-10 hypocotyls to exogenous phytohormones was examined. In wild-type seedlings, exogenous NAA (a synthetic auxin) inhibits hypocotyl growth. This response was enhanced in the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant (Fig. 7A). The hypocotyl growth inhibition responses of the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutant to cytokinin and ethylene was also examined. Exogenous applications of BA (a synthetic cytokinin) or ACC (an immediate biosynthetic precursor of ethylene) inhibited wild-type hypocotyl growth. However, in contrast to the case with NAA, ore14-1/arf2-10 hypocotyls showed a nearly normal inhibition response to BA or ACC (Fig. 7B, C), although they were slightly more sensitive at >1 muM ACC. These results indicate that the ore14-1/arf2-10 mutation does not cause defects in the known signal transduction pathways that underlie the perception and response to ethylene or cytokinin. They also suggest that ore14-1/arf2-10 preferentially alters the auxin response, at least with regard to hypocotyl growth. Together, these data demonstrate that ARF2 is a true repressor of auxin signalling, supporting previous results from protoplast transient assays (Tiwari et al., 2003).. . Fig. 7.. . Hypocotyl growth inhibition responses to exogenous phytohormones. Seedlings of wild type (Col) and the ore14-1 mutant were grown for 4 d in various concentrations of NAA (A), ACC (B), or BA (C).

PMC2607017	Results. . Generation of a Hypomorphic Mutant Reveals Different CUL3 Functions during Arabidopsis Development. Previously it was shown that the combined disruption of both Arabidopsis CUL3A and CUL3B genes causes embryo lethality [15]-[17]. To further investigate the function of CUL3 in plants, we searched for additional Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines. One line was of particular interest as the T-DNA was inserted at the very end of the CUL3A coding sequence. This mutant allele, called cul3a-3 was further characterised. The T-DNA insertion creates a mutation, in which the last two amino acids of the protein are replaced by an eight-residue peptide (Figure 1A). The cul3a-3 mutant line produces a lower abundant truncated transcript (Figure 1B). Interestingly, the CUL3A protein detected by a specific anti-peptide antibody [18] was not only less abundant, but was also hyper-rubylated (Figure 1C), suggesting that the truncated CUL3A protein is less prone to de-rubylation. It is noteworthy that cycles of rubylation/de-rubylation are important for CRLs activity (reviewed in [22]).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000328.g001. Figure 1. .

G. 58-day-old wild type and cul3hyp mutant plants under short days conditions.. . . . Homozygous cul3a-3 mutant plants are fertile and do not show morphological defects under normal growth conditions. As CUL3A and CUL3B genes are functionally redundant, we generated a double mutant using the previously characterized cul3b-1 knockout line [17]. The double homozygous cul3a-3 cul3b-1 mutant, hereafter called cul3 hypomorph (cul3hyp), was viable, but exhibited several developmental defects. Approximately 10% of homozygous cul3hyp seedlings displayed altered cotyledon phenotypes (Table 1). Some seedlings exhibited a single cotyledon while others, at a lower frequency, had three cotyledons (Figure 1D); seedlings with partially or totally fused cotyledons were also observed (not shown). In addition, the vascular patterning of cotyledons was often abnormal (Figure 1E). In particular, we observed interrupted and freely ending veins. In less than 1% of these seedlings we observed other abnormalities, such as root-less seedlings (not shown). The absence of root meristem was previously revealed in some of the Arabidopsis cul3a-1 cul3b-1 double null mutants that could complete their embryonic development [17].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000328.t001.

The subset of cul3hyp seedlings that had normal organ patterning displayed epinastically curled cotyledons and shorter roots when grown in the light (Figure 1F). At a latter stage of development, the most striking phenotype was a reduced rosette size and a delay in flowering (Figure 1G). Consistently, a slight delay in flowering was observed in single cul3a-1 loss-of-function mutant [18].. Overall, our data indicate that Arabidopsis CUL3A and CUL3B are important for plant growth and development, both during embryogenesis and at post-embryonic stages.. . . The cul3hyp Double Mutant Displays a Triple Response in the Absence of Ethylene. Because ETO1 is involved in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway and physically interacts with Arabidopsis CUL3A [20], most likely through its BTB domain, we investigated whether the cul3hyp mutant is affected in ethylene-mediated processes. In accordance with this speculation, etiolated cul3hyp mutants displayed a typical triple response in the absence of ethylene, which is characterized by short hypocotyls, short roots, and exaggerated apical hooks (Figure 2). The phenotype was similar to that of eto1-1, though less severe than the constitutive triple response1 (ctr1-1) mutant. It is noteworthy that the single cul3a-3 mutant displayed a weak triple response. Moreover, when germinated in the presence 5 M ACC, the cul3hyp mutant was still responsive to ethylene in a root elongation assay (Figure S1).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000328.g002. Figure 2. . The cul3hyp mutant exhibits the triple response in the dark.. A. Phenotypes of 3-day-old etiolated seedlings of the indicated genotypes grown without ACC. B. Hypocotyl (light grey) and root (dark grey) length measurements of 3-day-old etiolated seedlings of the indicated genotypes grown without ACC. Values are average lengths (meansSD) of >30 hypocotyls or roots. T-tests were performed for each value compared to WT (the triple mutants were compared to their corresponding ethylene-insensitive mutants) indicating significant differences (p<0.05). The (*) symbol highlights values for which p>0.05.. . . . To better characterize whether the CUL3A and CUL3B genes are involved in the control of ethylene biosynthesis or might also play functions further downstream in the signalling cascade, we first used a pharmacological approach. We found that treatment with 2 M aminoethoxyvinyl glycine (AVG), which inhibits ACC synthase and hence ethylene biosynthesis [23], significantly reversed the cul3hyp triple response (Figure S1). However, AVG has toxic effects and it inhibited root elongation of wild-type plants even at low concentrations (not shown).. Thus, we undertook a genetic approach and generated triple mutant combinations with ethylene-insensitive or resistant mutants in the ethylene-signalling cascade. In all triple mutants, etr1-1 cul3hyp, ein2-1 cul3hyp and ein3-1 cul3hyp, the triple response observed in the cul3hyp hypomorph was significantly, but not entirely suppressed (Figure 2). We conclude that the triple response phenotype of cul3hyp can be mostly explained by a function of CUL3A and CUL3B upstream of ethylene perception. However, the fact that both hypocotyl and root length were slightly reduced in all three triple mutants compared to their corresponding single ethylene insensitive or resistant mutants indicates that Arabidopsis CUL3 genes act also at other levels, which are ethylene independent.. . . Ethylene Production of cul3hyp Is Significantly Enhanced by the eto1-1 and etr1-1 Mutations. We generated an eto1-1 cul3hyp triple mutant and found only a slight additive effect on the triple response regarding root growth (Figure S1). These data indicate that the triple response observed in cul3hyp is mainly attributed to a defect in the CUL3ETO1 E3 ligase, but does not exclude the possibility that the two ETO1-related proteins, EOL1 and/or EOL2 [20] may also play some minor roles in this process.. As a next step, we measured ethylene emission between day 3 and day 4 in the etiolated mutant seedlings. Consistently, the cul3hyp mutant accumulated two to three-fold more ethylene gas than did the wild type control (Figure 3A), but significantly less than eto1 seedlings. To further confirm that the triple response observed in the etiolated seedlings is the consequence of CUL3A/B knockdown, we transformed the cul3hyp double mutant with a binary vector spanning a CUL3A genomic fragment [18]. Several transformants were recovered, which suppressed the triple response (not shown) as well as ethylene overproduction (Figure 3A).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000328.g003. Figure 3. . Ethylene production and ACS5 turnover in the cul3hyp mutant.. A. Ethylene emission from combinatorial mutants of the indicated genotypes. Etiolated seedlings were grown in sealed vials and the amount of ethylene released was quantified by gas chromatography (pL, pico Liter). Each bar represents the average (SE) of three separate vials with each vial measured in triplicate. B. The half-life of myc-ACS5 is increased in cul3hyp mutant seedlings. Wild type (left panel) or cul3hyp mutant (right panel) seedlings harbouring the myc-ACS5 transgene were grown for 4 days on MS medium containing either 1 nM DEX (wild type) or 10 nM DEX (cul3hyp) in the dark. The seedlings were washed in liquid MS medium lacking DEX and then suspended in liquid MS medium lacking DEX but containing the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide at time 0. At various times (indicated in minutes above each lane), the seedlings were harvested, and protein extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-myc monoclonal antibody. C. Phenotypes of 3-day-old etiolated seedlings of the indicated genotypes grown without ACC (left panel). Hypocotyl (light gray) and root (dark gray) length measurements of 3-day-old etiolated seedlings of the indicated genotypes grown without ACC (right panel). Values are average lengths (meansSD) of >30 hypocotyls or roots. For all mutants (except cin5-3) p<0.05 compared to wild type plants.. . . . Because the triple response of the eto1-1 cul3hyp triple mutant was slightly more severe than in the eto1-1 single mutant (Figure S1), we measured ethylene production in the triple eto1-1 cul3hyp mutant (Figure 3A). There was an increase of about 3-fold in ethylene production as compared to the eto1-1 parent, suggesting that CUL3A/B controls ethylene production by both ETO1-dependent and independent mechanisms.. There was also an increase of about 3-fold in ethylene production in the etr1-1 cul3hyp mutant compared to etr1-1 (Figure 3A). Likewise, ethylene production was increased in the ein3-1 cul3hyp triple mutant compared to the cul3hypparent, despite the fact that ein3-1 does not overproduce ethylene. This data indicates that CUL3A/B acts additively with the autoinhibition control of ethylene biosynthesis.. . . ACS5 Is a Target of CUL3 in Arabidopsis. ETO1 directly interacts with ACS5 to inhibit its activity, but also mediates ACS5 26S proteasome-dependent degradation, most likely via CUL3A/B [20]. Moreover, the cin5-3 mutation, which disrupts the ACS5 gene [24], significantly reduces ethylene production in eto1-1 and partially suppresses its constitutive triple response [25]. Thus, we speculated that the constitutive triple response observed in CUL3A/B knockdown was mainly the consequence of ACS5 protein stabilisation. To address this issue, we first introgressed a transgenic line expressing a Dex-inducible myc-tagged ACS5 [25] into the cul3hyp double mutant background. Due to partial silencing of the ACS5 reporter construct in the cul3 hypomorph, we could not compare directly the myc-ACS5 protein accumulation in cul3hyp and wild-type backgrounds at identical concentrations of dexamethasone (Dex). However, by increasing Dex levels, we could normalize the expression of myc-ACS5 in cul3hyp and compare myc-tagged ACS5 protein half-lives in both genetic backgrounds (Figure 3B). After Dex-induction and subsequent removal, seedlings were incubated in presence of cycloheximide, which blocks de novo protein synthesis, and the myc-tagged ACS5 protein levels were then determined by immunoblot analysis. Whereas ACS5 protein in the wild type background had a very short half-life of 15 min as previously reported [25], there was no decrease in the level of ACS5 protein after 1 hour. Thus, Arabidopsis CUL3A and CUL3B are involved in the turnover of the ACS5 isoform. Furthermore, we produced the cin5-3 cul3hyp triple mutant and found that cin5-3 suppresses partially the triple response of cul3hyp (Figure 3C). Overall, we conclude that ACS5 is a primary target of CUL3A/B and ETO1 in seedlings, but other ACSs, in particular of the type-2 class, are most likely also degraded by this E3 ligase.. . . . CUL3A and CUL3B Regulate Primary Root Growth by a Mechanism Different from ETO1. . The cul3hyp mutant exhibits a shorter root (Figure 1F) and CUL3A/B genes are essential during embryogenesis for proper patterning of the hypophyseal lineage, important founders of the future root meristem [17]. Furthermore, the role of ethylene on primary root growth was recently emphasized by several reports [26]-[29]. To characterize the function of CUL3A/B during root development, the work focused on primary root growth.. At 11 days post-germination, the elongation of cul3hyp primary root showed a reduction of about 80% as compared to wild type (Figure 4A and Figure S2). The root growth defect was similar to ctr1. ein2-1 and ein3-1 (not shown) significantly suppressed this phenotype, but these mutations were unable to restore wild type root growth. Thus, CUL3A and CUL3B regulate primary root growth via both ethylene-dependent and independent mechanisms.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000328.g004. Figure 4. . The cul3hyp mutant affects primary root meristem size and cell number.. A. Kinetic analysis of primary root elongation of wild type compared to the indicated genotypes. Values are average lengths of >16 roots. B. Cortical cell lengths in the differentiation zone of 7-day-old wild type and mutant roots.

The (*) symbol highlights values (meristem size/cell number) for which p>0.05. E. Mitotic activity in wild type and cul3hyp mutant root meristems, which is monitored by the proCYCB1;1-GUS reporter. Values in the right panel are average numbers of stained cells (meansSE) of more than 18 roots.. . . . To better characterise this phenotype, we measured the length of cells in the cortex in the differentiation zone, because it was found that ethylene stimulates auxin biosynthesis and its basipetal transport to the root elongation zone, where auxin inhibits cell elongation [27],[29]. Consistent with such a scenario, we observed a 50% reduction in length of these cells in eto1-1 (Figure 4B). However to our surprise, cortical cell length in the differentiation zone was only marginally affected in the cul3hyp mutant. This suggests that the mechanism by which ethylene inhibits root growth in a CUL3-deficient mutant background is different from that reported for eto1 mutants and ACC-treated wild-type plants [27],[29].. Root growth depends on cell elongation and on cell production rates in the root apical meristem. Therefore we investigated whether CUL3A/B knockdown affects the meristem size and/or activity. Strikingly, we observed that in cul3hyp the meristem size and cell number was reduced compared to wild-type plants (Figure 4C-D). Interestingly, in the ctr1-1 mutant, there was also a significant reduction in both meristem size and cell number. Conversely, in eto1-1, the root meristem size and cell number were even slightly increased in comparison to wild-type plants, suggesting that ethylene overproduction in this mutant can have opposite effects in the root, negatively affecting cell expansion in the elongation zone but positively affecting root meristem size.. Importantly, the meristem phenotype of cul3hyp was suppressed by the ein2-1 and ein3-1 mutations and therefore is dependent on ethylene signalling. We investigated whether this phenotype in cul3hyp was the consequence of reduced cell cycle activity. To this end we introduced the pCYCB1;1::GUS reporter construct [30] into cul3hyp mutant background. The Destruction box of plant B-type mitotic cyclins targets proteins for degradation after mitosis [31] and thus the pCYCB1;1::GUS reporter is a suitable marker to identify cells in G2-to-early M phase. The number of CycB;1:GUS expressing cells was not significantly reduced in the root apical meristem of cul3hyp compared to wild-type plants (Figure 4E). Thus, the most likely explanation of the ethylene-dependent inhibition of root growth is that cells in the cul3hyp mutant prematurely exit the meristem and make the transition to cell expansion.. . . The cul3hyp Mutation Affects Distal Root Patterning in an Ethylene-Independent Manner. To get more insights into the mechanism(s) by with CUL3A/B regulate root growth, we determined the expression pattern of both genes in Arabidopsis roots by using promoter-GUS fusions. After short GUS staining, we observed the strongest histochemical pCUL3A::GUS localization in the stele, but also in the distal part of the root (Figure 5A). A similar expression pattern was also observed for the pCUL3B::GUS reporter, although the signal was weaker in the stele. In the cul3hyp mutant, this region revealed clear defects of cell division patterns in the quiescent center (QC), other cells of the root stem cell niche and the columella root cap (Figure 5B-E). Starch granule staining, which marks only differentiated columella cells, showed premature differentiation of the columella root cap initials (Figure 5B). To investigate whether this defect in root meristem patterning is associated with mis-specification of the QC or columella cells, we examined the expression of different markers in the cul3hyp mutant background. In cul3hyp plants expressing QC-specific marker QC46 (Figure 5B) or endodermis and QC marker pSCR::H2BYFP (Figure 5C), we could identify signal in cells of the QC region, even when their morphology or cell number was altered. However, when we used columella-specific markers (Figure 5D-E) and in particular Q1630, which is only expressed in layers C1 and C2 in wild type (n=21), we observed a different pattern in the cul3hyp mutant plants. The marker was in general expressed in additional columella cell layers (50%, n=32) or showed a patchy distribution (22%, n=32).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000328.g005. Figure 5. .

Columella-specific enhancer trap Q1630 and PET111 in wild type (left) and cul3hyp mutant (right) roots. Q1630 is only expressed in columella layers C1 and C2.. . . . It was recently reported that ethylene modulates cell division in the QC, which can eventually lead to additional columella cell layers [26]. Therefore we investigated whether the phenotype observed in cul3hyp is dependent on ethylene signalling. However, this was not the case as defects of cell division in the QC and columella remained in the ein3-1 cul3hyp triple mutant (Figure 5B). Moreover, contrarily to the report of Ortega-Martinez et al. [26], we did not observe deregulated QC cell divisions in the eto1-1 mutant. Thus, we conclude that the knockdown of CUL3A/B function in Arabidopsis disturbs distal root patterning by a mechanism that is ethylene independent.. . . PIN7 Protein Accumulates in cul3hyp Collumella Cells by a Post-Transcriptional Mechanism. Auxin is involved in distal pattern formation of Arabidopsis roots [32]. To investigate whether auxin signalling is affected in cul3hyp, we introduced the DR5rev-GFP reporter construct into the cul3hyp mutant and monitored GFP expression in the root tip (Figure 6A). The spatial distribution of DR5 expression in the mutant was more narrow and also reduced in intensity in comparison to wild type roots (Figure 6A), indicating that auxin signalling is reduced in the distal part of cul3hyp roots.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000328.g006. Figure 6. . The cul3hyp mutant accumulates PIN7 in the root cap.. A. On the left panel, expression of the auxin-sensitive reporter DR5rev-GFP in wild type (left) and cul3hyp mutant (middle and right) roots.

PIN2 expression and polarity monitored by the pPIN2::PIN2-GFP reporter in wild type (left) and cul3hyp mutant (right) roots. D. PIN7 expression and polarity monitored by the pPIN7::PIN7-GFP reporter in wild type (left) and cul3hyp mutant (middle and right) roots. E. Ratio of the GFP signal between the stele and the columella tissues. F. Relative levels of PIN7 transcripts (determined by real-time RT-PCR) in 10 day-old root tips (1 cm of the root starting from the root tip) in cul3hyp and Col control plants. Data are meansSE.. . . . PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are rate-limiting factors catalysing polar auxin transport [33]-[34]. These proteins are crucial for auxin distribution and as such provide positional information to coordinate plant development. Because auxin signalling was reduced in the cul3hyp distal part of the root, one possibility is that the auxin gradient is disturbed in this mutant. Thus, we introduced into the cul3hyp mutant background different PIN::PIN-GFP reporters, consisting of their endogenous promoters and translational fusions between PIN1, PIN2 and PIN7 proteins and GFP. Whereas PIN1 and PIN2 expression patterns and levels were similar to wild type in cul3hyp (Figure 6B-C), we observed a higher expression level of PIN7 in columella cells (Figure 6D). The ratio of the GFP signal between the stele and the columella tissues was four-to-five times higher in cul3hyp roots in comparison to wild type (Figure 6E). PIN gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional, but also post-transcriptional levels [35]. Thus we performed quantitative RT-PCR assays on PIN7 gene expression on isolated wild type and cul3hyp root tips. In contrast to the PIN7 protein accumulation in columella cells, the PIN7 transcript level in cul3hyp was slightly reduced in comparison to wild type (Figure 7F). Our data indicate that CUL3A/B knockdown induces in the highest CUL3 expression domain PIN7 accumulation, most likely by a post-transcriptional mechanism.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000328.g007. Figure 7. . Models for CUL3A/B action in ethylene biosynthesis and root growth.. A. Proposed model based on our genetic interactions to explain the role of CUL3A and CUL3B in ethylene biosynthesis. ETO1-dependent and independent effects on ethylene emission have been observed. (1) CUL3A/BETO1 controls ACS5 and most likely other type-2 ACSs protein stability. (2) ETO1 inhibits ACSs also independently of CUL3A/B [20]. The negative feedback mechanism from ethylene perception and signal transduction to ethylene biosynthesis is also shown. B. We propose a model in which the ethylene pathway acts at two different levels to inhibit primary root growth. The first mode of action triggered by ethylene is an inhibition of cell elongation as earlier reported [27],[29]. This mechanism most likely involves ETO1 and can be mimicked by exogenous application of ethylene. The second mechanism affects cell differentiation at the exit of the meristem and involves CUL3A/B..
PMC4910468	Results. . Root Morphometric Analyses of the Arabidopsis Accessions. Arabidopsis has been collected from a wide range of habitats distributed mainly over the Northern hemisphere, thus each accession has acquired some specific characteristics in response to environmental conditions. For this work, we selected 12 accessions from different habitats and regions with contrasting environmental conditions, including accessions from America (Columbia, Col-0), Asia (Pamiro-Alay, Sha; and Wassilewskija, Ws), Africa (Cape Verdi Islands, Cvi-0) and Europe (San Eleno, Se-0; Bayreuth, Bay; Frankfurt, Fr-2; Ovelgoenne, Ove-0; Landsberg erecta, Ler; Ascot/Berks, CIBC10 and HR5; and Tabor, Ta-0) (Table 1). Their root phenotypes were studied under our plant growth conditions. We found a wide range of root architectures and variation in other root traits as well (Supplementary Figure S1).. Quantitative analyses of root system architecture of the Arabidopsis accessions used were obtained with geometric morphometrics. For this, we defined six landmarks (Figure 1A), which cover the root architecture including: a position on the transition between shoot and root (landmark 1), the initiation of the first lateral root (landmark 2), the tip of the longest lateral roots in each side (landmark 3 and 4), the initiation of the latest lateral emerged root (landmark 5) and the apex of the primary root (landmark 6). According to these landmarks we obtained the morphological pattern, in where all accessions fit (Figure 1B). To eliminate variation in size, position and orientation of each accession, and thereby obtain the coordinates superimposed landmarks, that are the core of geometric morphometric for multivariate analysis (Klingenberg, 2011), we performed the least-squares procrustes superimpositions (Dryden and Mardia, 1998) to fitting a model that completely describes the differences between Arabidopsis root shapes of each accession to fit a very simple model that only takes into consideration global parameters such as differences in rotation, translation and scale. Each Arabidopsis accession was pairwise-compared, except for HR5, because it has very few and short lateral roots, which do not fit in the landmarks coordinates (Supplementary Figure S1). According to procrustes distances obtained in these analysis (Supplementary Table S1), we selected accessions with higher (Cvi-0 and Ws), intermediate (Sha) and lower (Fr-2 and Col-0) procrustes distances to identify the morphometric patterns from each Arabidopsis accession and its differences in the multivariate state-space by analysis of CVA. This parameter maximizes the differences among accessions relative to the variation among them, identifying groups according to their morphology. The scatter plot shows a similar distribution among accessions, although the accession average shapes (P < 0.05) were clearly distinct for Cvi-0 and Ws, that form two different clusters which are separated from Col-0, Fr2 and Sha overlapping clusters, being Sha accession the most distal one (Figure 1C). The score of CV1 (first axis) indicates that root morphology differs mainly in the vertical displacement of the first longest left lateral roots, whereas CV2 (second axis) was associated to differences in the orientation of lateral roots, which are closer to primary root, and the displacement of the last lateral root (Figure 1C).. To display the main patterns of variation in shape space, we used global PCA (Klingenberg et al., 1996). In this analysis we identified that the first three principal components (PCA1 to 3) covered over 72.96% of variation of root morphology among Arabidopsis accessions. PCA1 accounted for 37.03% of the observed variation, whereas PCA2 and PCA3 accounted for 21.72% and 14.21%, respectively (Figure 2). Using eigenvalues higher than 0.3 (ter Braak, 1988), we identified that the landmarks associated to main variation of PCA1 were the distance and orientation between the longest left lateral root and the primary root, as well as the orientation of the primary root, while for PCA2 the landmarks were the distance between the longest right and left lateral roots and primary root (Figure 2A). The landmarks for PCA 3 were the orientation between the longest right lateral root and the primary root (Figure 2B). The morphology variations for PCA1 were more evident in the pairwise comparisons between contrasting shapes, like Cvi-0 with Col-0, Fr-2 or Ws (Figure 3), whereas for PCA2 were more evident between Ws with Fr-2, and Col-0 or Cvi-0 with Fr-2 (Figure 3).. .

Arabidopsis Root Length Variation and Its Relationship to Environmental Conditions. According to root length at 9 dag, we classified Cvi-0 and Ws as short root plants, whereas Ler, Col-0 and CIBC10 as long root plants (Figure 4). We also found that the roots of the Fr-2, HR5 and Ove-0 were short but slightly longer than Cvi-0 and Ws, whereas the ones from Se-0 and Sha were long but slightly shorter than Ler, Col-0 and CIBC10, while the roots of the remaining accessions were of intermediate length (Figure 4). Normally, the root length is associated with its growth rate; however, in the first 24 h after germination, the growth rate of some accessions is not correlated with their root length at 9 dag, such as shown for Cvi-0 and Ws, that had a growth rate of 0.1  0.02 mmh-1, similar to Col-0 and Ler, while the former two accessions have short roots (Figure 5A). In contrast, CIBC10 growth rate was 0.07  0.02 mmh-1, like that of HR5 and Fr-2, which are slightly short root accessions (Figure 5A). These discrepancies were due to the fact that the growth rate of Cvi-0 and Ws, two short root plants, were faster only in the first 24 h, but after that, growth rate was slightly lower than the long root accessions, exhibiting a non-linear trend between root length and growth rate with R2= 0.62 and 0.59 (P < 2.2  10-16), respectively (Figures 5B,C). Whereas CIBC10 and Col-0, two long root accessions, grew at a constant rate as shown in Figures 5D,E, in which the root length is proportional to the growth rate with R2= 0.86 and 0.83 (P < 2.2  10-16), respectively.. . FIGURE 4. . Arabidopsis root length variations. Box plot for root length size in centimeters (cm) from Cvi-0, Ws, Fr-2, HR5, Ove-0, Ta-0, Bay-0, Se-0, Sha, Ler, Col-0 and CIBC10 at 9 dag.

Root growth rate variation among Arabidopsis accessions.

Correlation plots between root length and growth rate for Cvi-0 (B), Ws (C), CIBC10 (D), and Col-0 (E). Lineal correlation (R2) at P value < 2.2  10-16 is indicated in each plot.. . . . Root growth and morphology depend partly on environmental conditions and these characteristics can frequently be retained and inherited in populations as an adaptive trade (Richards et al., 2012). To assess the relationship between root length and environmental conditions (Table 1), we obtained Spearman linear correlation coefficients to analyze the influence of temperature and precipitation in the root length. No correlation was found between root length and temperature (Supplementary Figure S2). However a positive Spearman rank correlation of rs= 0.60 (P < 2.2  10-16) was found between root length and precipitation (Figure 6), indicating that low levels of precipitation are associated with short root accessions and vice versa. This is well exemplified with Cvi-0, Sha and Col-0 accessions. Cvi-0 comes from Cape Verdi Island a habitat with lower levels of precipitation and the accession collected from here has a short root accession compared to Col (or the others), while Col-0 and Sha have long roots and come from Columbia and Pamiro-Alay, respectively, two habitats with high precipitations (Figure 6). Although not all accessions showed high correlations between their root length and precipitation conditions, these data indicate that annual precipitation levels, especially the most extreme conditions, are a more determinant factor than mean annual temperature in affecting root length in these Arabidopsis populations.. . FIGURE 6. . Arabidopsis root length variation and its relationship to precipitation. Spearman correlation analysis between root length and the average annual precipitation from habitats of each Arabidopsis accession (n > 30), rs = 0.60 at P-value <2.2  10-16. The red lines represent the root mean lengths for each accession. The gray line shows the mean root length of all Arabidopsis accessions (mean = 5.07).. . . . . . Arabidopsis RAM Size Variation and Its Association with Root Length. Root growth depends on the balance between cell proliferation and cell expansion, two processes associated with RAM homeostasis. Generally, a high proliferation rate at the RAM produces more cells that are able to differentiate and expand, resulting in a high growth rate (Baskin, 2013). To analyze the association of the RAM size with root length, we first evaluated the size of the RAM based on its length and the number of cortex cells from the QC to the first elongated cortex cell, separating small proliferative cells from large fast expanding cells, found in the elongation zone (Casamitjana-Martinez et al., 2003; Hacham et al., 2011). Interestingly, we found in some Arabidopsis accessions that the number of cortex cells in the RAM does not determine the RAM length. This was the case of Cvi-0 and Ws that share the same number of meristem cortex cells (37.67  3.16) but their RAM length differs by 33.06 mum; likewise Sha and Se-0 as well as Ler, CIBC10 and Ta-0, that contain 40.73  4.53, and 51.30  6.06 cortex cells and their RAM length differ 44.31 and 71.88 mum, respectively (Figure 7A). The differences in RAM length were due to variation in the size of cells close to elongation zone (the transition domain), as it is shown in Cvi-0, Ta-0 and Sha, which have larger cells than Ws, CIBC10 or Ler and Se-0, respectively (Figure 7B). The statistic analysis in all comparisons indicate that the differences on cell length was significantly associated to the accession rather than its position (P-value Cvi-0/Ws = 1.24  10-09, P value CIBC10/Ler/Ta-0 = 2.68  10-15, P-value Sha/Se-0 = 9.06  10-09), thus the differences between meristematic cell length in transition zone were due to intrinsic factors of each accession, and not to the position of the cells in the meristematic zone (P-value Cvi-0/Ws = 0.87, P-value CIBC10/Ler/Ta-0 = 0.32, P-value Sha/Se-0 = 0.67) or to the interaction of both factors (P-value Cvi-0/Ws = 0.84, P-value CIBC10/Ler/Ta-0 = 0.75, P-value Sha/Se-0 = 0.30). These data reveal that the discrepancies between RAM cortex cell number and length seem to be due to differences in the size of cells from the transition zone.. . FIGURE 7. . Arabidopsis root apical meristem variation and its association with root length. (A) The RAM length in micrometers (mum) and RAM cortex cell number of Ws, Ove-0, Cvi-0, Fr-2, Se-0, Sha, Col-0, HR5, Bay-0, CIBC10, Ler, and Ta-0; (n > 30). (B) Cell position from QC and the length of each cell from RAM of Cvi-0 (green), Ws (purple), CIBC10 (red), Ta-0 (pink), Ler (light blue), Sha (orange) and Se-0 (gray). For better visualization, each plots only show a representative sample of n = 10. The P-value of two-way ANOVA analysis is shown on each plot and represents the differences in cell length as an effect of belonging to each accession (C) Root length in centimeters (cm) and RAM cortex cell number of Arabidopsis accessions; (n > 30). Seedlings of 5 dag were used. Bars represent standard error.. . . . We then decided to evaluate the association between RAM and whole root length, considering only the cortex cell number. This was motivated by the fact that it has been reported that the number of cells in the RAM reflects its proliferative capacity, which has an important impact in root growth modulation (Baskin, 2013). Thus, RAM length was directly related with root length in Fr-2, Ws, Ove-0, and Se-0, as well as in Ta-0 and Ler (Figure 7C), whereas the number of RAM cortex cells in Cvi-0 and HR5 were similar to Fr-2, Ws or Ove-0, however, their roots were shorter than the latter accessions, and similar behavior was observed in Bay (Figure 7C). We also found that Sha and Col-0, two long root accessions have a small RAM in comparison to Ler, Ta-0 and CIBC10, which have largest RAM and long roots (Figure 7C). These results suggest that the number of RAM cortex cells is not always directly proportional to root length. In some Arabidopsis accessions other events occurring at the differentiation zone may be more relevant in determining root length. On the other hand, it is important to note that at this time (5 dag), the comparative analysis in root length among accessions differs from the results of roots at 9 dag (Figure 4). This is mainly so, in Ws and Ta-0, which at 9 dag have short and intermediate roots, respectively; whereas at 5 dag their length was intermediate for Ws and long for Ta-0. This provides additional evidence concerning the impact of a non-constant root growth rate.. . . Root Stem Cell Niche Structure Variations among Arabidopsis Accessions. The root stem cell niche organization of Arabidopsis has been described for Col-0, Ler and Ws accessions (Tapia-Lopez et al., 2008; Kornet and Scheres, 2009). As it can be seen in Figure 8, the QC cells are surrounded by one layer of initial/stem cells of cortex/endodermal, as well as of columella and epidermal/lateral root cap cells, that can differentiate into different cell types (Dolan et al., 1993). When the stem cell niche of the different Arabidopsis accessions was analyzed, we found that the stem cell niche of Bay-0, CIBC10, Fr-2, Ove-0, Se-0 and Ta-0 has a similar organization as that of Col-0, in which generally a single layer of columella stem cells immediately distal to the QC (65%) are observed. While 48% of Cvi-0 and 34% of HR5 roots contain two layers of undifferentiated cells; in addition 80% of Cvi-0 and 73% of HR5 roots contain four tiers of differentiated columella cells with their characteristic starch granules stained with lugol (purple cells), in contrast to Col-0 in which 57% contain five and only 40% contain four differentiated columella layers (Figures 8B,C). Interestingly, we found that the stem cell niche of Sha has an uncommon organization, since the QC and columella stem cells are not well defined probably because they have aberrant divisions (Figure 8). In 90% of plants from the Sha accession we were unable to defined the columella stem cells, but interestingly, we could still find six layers of columella cells in 76% of the roots analyzed. These analyses indicated that the main natural variation in stem cell niche organization is in the columella stem and differentiated cells, however, molecular analysis will be necessary to determine the impact of these stem cell variations in root development.. .

PMC3017837	Results. Here, we completely sequenced 1047 Thellungiella full-length cDNAs representing abiotic-stress-related genes, transcription factor genes, and protein phosphatase 2C genes. The predicted coding sequences, 5'-UTRs, and 3'-UTRs were compared with those of orthologous genes from Arabidopsis for length, sequence similarity, and structure. The 5'-UTR sequences of Thellungiella and Arabidopsis orthologs shared a significant level of similarity, although the motifs were rearranged. While examining the stress-related Thellungiella coding sequences, we found a short splicing variant of T. halophila salt overly sensitive 1 (ThSOS1), designated ThSOS1S. ThSOS1S contains the transmembrane domain of ThSOS1 but lacks the C-terminal hydrophilic region. The expression level of ThSOS1S under normal growth conditions was higher than that of ThSOS1. We also compared the expression levels of Na+-transport-system genes between Thellungiella and Arabidopsis by using full-length cDNAs from each species as probes. Several genes that play essential roles in Na+ excretion, compartmentation, and diffusion (SOS1, SOS2, NHX1, and HKT1) were expressed at higher levels in Thellungiella than in Arabidopsis..
PMC3664179	Results. . Bur-0 is partially resistant to the eH isolate, but susceptible to the e2 isolate. The behavior of the Bur-0 accession was estimated from 21dpi with P. brassicae isolates. As previously reported (Jubault et al. 2008b; Alix et al. 2007), the Bur-0 accession had an intermediate behavior in response to inoculation with the eH isolate, with a mean DI of 66 at 21dpi. Bur-0 plants infected with this isolate typically showed only tiny clubs confined mainly to the secondary root systems and well-developed green rosettes (Fig.1a and Table1). On the contrary, Bur-0 was susceptible in response to inoculation with the e2 isolate, with a mean DI of 90 at 21dpi. The plants infected with this isolate exhibited a big club replacing the main and secondary root systems and smaller rosettes (Fig.1b and Table1). A set of differential hosts, including susceptible and resistant genotypes of different Brassica species, was also evaluated at 49dpi to characterize the isolates pathogenicity. This confirmed that both isolates, eH and e2 (Fhling et al. 2003), used in this study belong to the P. brassicae pathotype P1 (Som et al. 1996).Table 1Evaluation of Bur-0 gall and leaf areas during partial resistance (inoculated with the eH isolate) and susceptibility (inoculated with the e2 isolate) responses to P. brassicaeIsolateGall area, GaRosette leaf area, LaGa/La pathological indexeH0.060.0325.61.7613.638.41e20.130.0116.81.0249.093.2Means are estimated from 18 plants at 28dpi. The Ga/La pathological index reflects the ratio between Ga and rosette La. Results are reported in square centimetersstandard deviation. . . Analysis of global changes in gene expression in partial resistance and susceptibility responses to P. brassicae infection. We know relatively little about changes in gene expression that occur during partial resistance response to P. brassicae infection and their specificity in comparison to the susceptible response. Thus, to gain insights into the transcriptional changes specifically associated with partial resistance, genome-wide expression analyses were carried out at the whole-plant level on the Bur-0 accession infected either with water, eH, or e2 isolates. First, to investigate the timing and extent of transcriptional changes associated with partial clubroot resistance response, comparisons were made between the transcript profiles of Bur-0 plants inoculated with the isolate eH and water-inoculated plants (i.e., control plants) over the time course of infection. To specifically relate host responses to the pathogen life cycle, comparisons were made during the symptomless phase at 1, 2 (corresponding to the primary phase), and 7dpi (corresponding to the initiation of secondary infection in the cortex; Mithen and Magrath 1992; Puzio et al. 2000; Devos et al. 2006; Fig.2, comparisons 1-3). Statistical analysis of these comparisons revealed that 822 genes were significantly differentially expressed. Thus, 4% of the 22,089 Arabidopsis genes represented on the CATMA chip displayed changes in mRNA levels in the plants inoculated with the eH isolate. Among the 822 differentially expressed genes in partial resistance response to P. brassicae, 329 were up-regulated whereas 483 were down-regulated. In addition, the expression of ten genes was initially induced, but was then down-regulated (or vice versa) during the time course. A Venn diagram of comparisons 1-3 (Fig.3) showed that the pattern of host gene expression in partial resistance response became increasingly complex over the time course, with 66, 174, and 706 genes differentially expressed at 1, 2, and 7dpi, respectively.Fig. 3Venn diagram showing the differential distribution with time point of differentially expressed genes in eH-inoculated plants (partial resistance). dpi days post-inoculation. In order to identify specific transcript changes between partial resistance and susceptibility responses, the transcript profiles of Bur-0 plants inoculated with either the eH isolate (leading to partial resistance) or with the e2 isolate (leading to complete susceptibility) were compared. Comparisons between the non-inoculated and eH-inoculated plants (described above) showed that host response at the whole-plant level was mainly induced at 7dpi, which corresponds to the initiation of secondary infection in the cortex. Thus, we chose this kinetic point to make comparisons between responses to the eH and e2 isolates (Fig.2, comparison 6). Statistical analysis of this comparison revealed 210 genes displaying significant differential expression at 7dpi. Thus, only 1% of the 22,089 Arabidopsis genes represented on the CATMA chip displayed changes in mRNA levels between susceptible and partial resistance responses. Among these, 120 genes were expressed at a higher level in eH-inoculated plants compared to the e2-inoculated ones, whereas 90 genes were expressed at a lower level. Only 94 genes showing differential expression were common to both experiments (comparison between non-inoculated and eH-inoculated plants and comparison between eH- and e2-inoculated plants).. To investigate which biological processes the differentially regulated genes may be involved in, we classified genes according to the functional categories defined by the Functional Catalogue (FunCat) in the MatDB database (MIPS A. thaliana Database; Fig.4). This functional categorization carried out on all the genes identified in the time course comparisons between Bur-0 eH-inoculated and control plants showed that genes belonging to all functional groups were affected during the increasing host response to P. brassicae infection in the partial resistance response. Furthermore, for almost all biological processes, genes were more often seen to be repressed than induced, with the exception of genes involved in cellular rescue, defense, and cellular communication which were induced. Functional categorization carried out on the genes identified in comparisons between eH- and e2-inoculated plants showed that most of these genes are involved in cellular rescue and defense, metabolism, and transcription-related processes (Fig.4). A similar number of genes were expressed at a higher or lower level in almost all categories, except for cellular communication and hormone metabolism for which genes were predominantly up- and down-regulated, respectively.Fig. 4Distribution of the differentially expressed genes classified into functional categories. Genes were assigned to functional categories based on the Functional Catalogue (FunCat) scheme in the MatDB database (MIPS Arabidopsis thaliana Database). Genes of unknown function are not shown. The number of genes identified by the Functional Catalogue is indicated on the x-axis. . . Differential expression in microarrays was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. In order to validate the microarray data, a number of genes differentially expressed in at least one of the two studies were selected from different functional categories and their expression measured in control and infected tissues using quantitative RT-PCR. The RT-PCR profiles of these genes revealed that they exhibited the same temporal patterns and direction changes (up- or down-regulated) in gene expression as observed in the microarray experiments (Fig.5).Fig. 5Validation of microarray data by quantitative RT-PCR. Microarray (gray) and quantitative RT-PCR (black) results are expressed in a log2 ratio obtained for comparisons between eH-inoculated (eH-I) and non-inoculated (NI) plants at 1, 2, and 7dpi for the first experiment and between eH-inoculated (eH-I) and e2-inoculated (e2-I) plants at 7dpi for the second one. A positive ratio indicates that the gene is significantly induced in eH-inoculated plants in comparison to non-inoculated or e2-inoculated plants; a negative ratio means that the gene is significantly repressed in eH-inoculated plants in comparison to non-inoculated or e2-inoculated plants. dpi days post-inoculation. . . The molecular basis of clubroot partial resistance response. We then analyzed the role played by metabolic pathways using the MAPMAN software (Thimm et al. 2004; Fig.6). MAPMAN is a user-driven tool that displays large data sets, such as gene expression data from Arabidopsis microarrays, onto diagrams of metabolic pathways or other processes in order to highlight general trends. Detailed numeric data are also presented in ESM TablesS2-B to S2-E.Fig. 6Schematic representation of the gene expression profiles of metabolic and defense pathways in eH-inoculated plants (partial resistance) at 7days post-inoculation. Differential gene expression in tetrapyrrole synthesis (A), light reaction enzymes (B), Calvin cycle enzymes (C), starch and sucrose synthesis (D), starch and sucrose degradation (E), sugar transporters (F), glycolysis enzymes (G), fermentation enzymes (H), tricarboxylic acid cycle (I), electron transport enzymes (J), redox status regulation (K), signaling pathways (L), WRKY transcription factors (M), PR proteins (N), isoprenoid metabolism (O), lignin metabolism (P), wax metabolism (Q), flavonoid metabolism (R), cell adhesion (S), cell wall modification (T), and cell wall degradation (U). Each square symbolizes a differentially expressed gene. Numbers +2 to -2 on the color scale represent log2 of the fold change between the inoculated and non-inoculated plants. A positive ratio (red square) indicates that the gene is induced in eH-inoculated plants in comparison to non-inoculated plants; a negative ratio (green square) means that the gene is repressed in eH-inoculated plants in comparison to non-inoculated plants. C chloroplast, M mitochondrion, Pb Plasmodiophora brassicae. . Hosts primary metabolism regulation in response to eH infection. Major transcriptional changes in photosynthetic light reactions and carbohydrate metabolism occurred in the partial resistance response. Indeed, 22% of all genes differentially expressed in the Bur-0 plants inoculated with the eH isolate were primary metabolism-related genes. The transcript levels of 18 genes involved in tetrapyrrole synthesis and photosynthesis (both the photochemical process and the Calvin cycle) were down-regulated mainly at 7dpi (Fig.6 and ESM TableS2-B). Probably linked to this decrease in photosynthesis, the transcript levels of seven genes involved in starch and sucrose synthesis and in the pentose phosphate pathway were also repressed at 7dpi. In contrast, we found that genes coding starch-degrading enzymes, including BAM3 (At4g20270) and PWD (At5g26570), and sucrose-degrading enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of hexose sugars and several sugar transporters were induced in infected plants at 7dpi. In addition, the expression of genes involved in energy production was also altered. Several genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in the respiratory chain were repressed. On the contrary, fermentation and production of ethanol appeared to be enhanced as genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase PDC1 (At5g54960) and PDC2 (At4g33070) were up-regulated.. . . Transcription factor regulation in response to eH infection. The expression of many transcription factors and signaling components was altered in response to P. brassicae inoculation. Of the overall genes, 13% were putative transcription factors differentially expressed mainly at 7dpi. These transcription factors belong to several major families, including WRKY, MYB, Basic-Helix-Loop-Helix, Homeobox, and zinc-finger family proteins (Fig.6 and ESM TableS2-C). Overall, the expression of transcription factors was down-regulated, with the exception of the WRKY class which was up-regulated in eH-inoculated plants. The fact that the transcription factors represent a wide distribution of gene families and that different expression profiles were observed may suggest that these are involved in controlling different processes and/or different phases of the response.. . . Host defense responses to eH infection. Further analysis showed that most of the 822 clubroot-induced Arabidopsis genes are potentially involved in host defense responses. In addition to WRKY transcription factors, some other signaling components, such as the calcium signaling pathway, were differentially expressed (Fig.6 and ESM TableS2-D). Whereas two genes encoding calmodulins and calcium-binding proteins were down-regulated at the first two time points, seven were up-regulated at 7dpi. Lastly, genes known or predicted to encode kinases were particularly abundant among the clubroot-induced genes. Numerous known or putative kinases were induced by P. brassicae inoculation at the end of the time course analysis. Of particular interest were 12 leucin-rich repeat (LRR)-containing receptor-like kinases. In contrast, four genes encoding G-proteins were down-regulated at 7dpi.. The third largest functional class (12%) contained genes involved in cell rescue and defense. Two thirds of these genes were up-regulated. At the first two time points post-inoculation, the defense-related group mainly included genes that were previously shown to be induced during abiotic stress, such as heat shock proteins or dehydrins. In contrast, at the later time point, the defense-related group was predominantly composed of genes encoding proteins frequently described during plant-pathogen interactions, such as enzymes involved in the removal of reactive oxygen species (ascorbate peroxidases, glutathione peroxidase, peroxidases, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferases) or pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins such as beta-1,3-glucanases, chitinases, thaumatin, and defensins.. The transcript levels of some genes involved in secondary metabolism were also modulated in the partial resistance response. Two branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway were altered upon eH inoculation. In the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, flavonol production appeared to have been favored since the gene encoding the flavonol synthase (At5g08640) was slightly up-regulated from 2dpi. On the contrary, a gene encoding dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (At4g27250), which drives the same substrate (dihydroflavonol) into another pathway leading to anthocyanins and tannins, was down-regulated at 7dpi. Among the flavonoid-related gene subset, DMR6 (At5g24530) exhibited the highest induction level at 7dpi. This gene, encoding an enzyme whose exact substrate is suspected to be a flavonoid, is known to be induced by the salicylic acid analogue BTH treatments and was reported to be involved in resistance to Hyaloperonospora parasitica (van Damme et al. 2008). Flavonoid accumulation was also reported in Arabidopsis roots following P. brassicae infection and was associated with the modulation of auxin efflux (Pasold et al. 2010). The lignin biosynthesis pathway was also affected; however, because genes involved in the same biosynthesis step showed conflicting differential regulations, the physiological impact of this pathway is unclear. Lastly, the expression of genes involved in isoprenoid and wax biosyntheses were down-regulated.. Analysis of the data also indicated that P. brassicae challenge significantly targeted several plant hormone signaling and stress response pathways. The down-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, such as the lipoxygenase LOX2 (At3g45140), in the JA signaling pathway, such as the desaturase SSI2 (At2g43710), or jasmonate-inducible genes such as beta-glucosidase BG1 (At1g52400), jacalin lectin proteins (At3g16450, At3g16470), hydroperoxide lyase HPL1 (At4g15440), and the GH3 family member JAR1 (At2g46370) suggested a down-regulation of the JA pathway at 2 and 7dpi. The gene encoding WRKY70 (At3g56400), a transcription factor which is well known to suppress jasmonic acid responses (Li et al. 2006), was up-regulated at 7dpi. Interestingly, in contrast, three ethylene (ET)-related genes involved in either synthesis, such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (At1g03400) and ACC oxidase (At5g43440), or response were up-regulated at 7dpi.. Several genes related to the acid salicylic (SA) pathway were also induced, such as the isochorismate synthase ICS1 (At1g74710) involved in SA biosynthesis and the lipase-like protein PAD4 (At3g52430) and two NPR1-interacting proteins-NIMIN1 (At1g02450) and NIMIN2 (At3g25882)-components of this defense signaling pathway. Furthermore, the genes SSI2 (At2g43710) and JAR1 (At2g46370), previously shown to negatively interact with the SA pathway (Thatcher et al. 2005), were down-regulated.. . . Cell division and expansion regulation in response to eH infection. Several genes involved in growth and cell cycle control, including cellular organization and cell division, were also differentially expressed, mainly at 7dpi (Fig.6 and ESM TableS2-E). Furthermore, three members of fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins, involved in cell adhesion, were also repressed at 7dpi. Numerous genes involved in cell wall modification were differentially expressed in the plants inoculated with the isolate eH, such as expansins and xyloglucan endotransglycosylases, which were down-regulated from 2dpi. Pectinesterases were mainly up-regulated at 7dpi. Genes involved in cell wall degradation such as beta-1,4-endoglucanase, glycosyl hydrolases, polygalacturonase, and pectate lyase were also differentially expressed.. P. brassicae inoculation modulated the stress hormone response pathway (JA, ET, SA), but plant host physiology also experienced specific shifts in auxin and cytokinin responses as well. Twelve auxin-related genes were differentially expressed following infection by P. brassicae isolate eH. Several auxin-related genes were differentially expressed at 1dpi, and their number increased with the infection. These include genes involved in auxin synthesis, such as nitrilase NIT1 (At3g44310) and myrosinase-binding proteins (At2g39310, At2g39330), as well as auxin transport and response, and these were mostly down-regulated. Only three auxin-related genes were up-regulated at 7dpi. Two genes involved in cytokinin metabolism were repressed at 7dpi: the isopentenyltransferase IPT9 (At5g20040), involved in cytokinin biosynthesis, and the response regulator ARR4 (At1g10470).. . . . What are the differences between partial clubroot resistance and susceptibility responses?. . Hosts primary metabolism regulation. Thirteen percent of all the genes that are differentially expressed between eH and e2 responses are predicted to function in primary metabolism. Almost all of them were found to be e2-specific or e2-enhanced regulations (ESM TableS2-B). As reported above, several genes involved in photosynthesis were repressed by eH at 7dpi. Among those, the gene GUN4 (At3g59400) involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis was found to be more repressed by e2 than by eH, and four other genes (At5g24120, At5g13630, At1g58290, and At2g21330) involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, photosynthesis regulation, and Calvin cycle were specifically repressed by e2. Similarly, the e2-specific induction of DPE (At2g40840) and the e2-enhanced induction of PWD (At5g26570), both involved in starch degradation, may suggest that e2 infection could result in an enhanced starch degradation process. The level of induction of the gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase PDC1 (At5g54960) was lower in the eH response, suggesting that the metabolic shift from aerobic to anaerobic fermentation associated with P. brassicae inoculation reported in the first microarray comparisons was also less pronounced in the partial resistant response than in the susceptible one.. . . Transcription factor regulation. Several putative transcription factors, representing almost 11% of the differentially expressed genes, showed differential expression depending on response type. Seven transcription factors belonging to the WRKY, MYB, bZIP, and zinc finger families were specifically repressed by e2 infection, and two were specifically induced by eH infection (WRK46 and At5g10380 coding a C3HC4-type RING finger protein).. . . Host defense responses. Compared to the gene expression patterns observed in response to eH, defense responses upon inoculation with the more aggressive isolate e2 were lower. Six percent of the genes which were differentially expressed between eH- and e2-inoculated plants are involved in signal transduction. Three genes coding kinases and three genes coding calmodulin-binding proteins were repressed specifically by infection with the isolate e2. Two genes coding protein kinase were also induced specifically by e2. One gene coding a calmodulin, one DUF receptor kinase, and one LRR-containing receptor kinase were specifically induced by eH. The second largest functional class (15%) contained genes involved in cell rescue and defense. Approximately half of these genes were previously shown to be induced during abiotic stress and were mainly induced in the e2-inoculated plants. The others have been frequently described during plant-pathogen interactions, such as genes involved in the removal of reactive oxygen species (glutathione peroxidase, peroxidase, catalases, and glutathione-S-transferase) or genes encoding pathogenesis-related proteins (thaumatin and defensin). Few genes involved in secondary metabolism such as the phenylpropanoid and the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways were differentially expressed between eH and e2 responses. Two genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway displayed e2-specific or e2-enhanced induction. The transcript levels of the genes At1g06570 and At4g32770 encoding 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and tocopherol cyclase, respectively, were specifically repressed in response to e2, suggesting that this regulation might be involved in susceptibility. Lastly, the repression of the CER1 gene (At1g022050) involved in wax biosynthesis was enhanced in response to eH, suggesting that this regulation could be involved in partial resistance.. At 7dpi, several JA-related genes were found to be specifically induced by e2 (ESM TableS2-D and Fig.S3), such as the JA biosynthetic genes LOX2 (At3g45140), encoding lipoxygenase, and AOS (At5g46250), encoding allene oxide synthase, and the JA-inducible genes BG1 (At1g52400) encoding a beta-glucosidase and CYP81D1 (At3g28740). The induction of the SA pathway appeared to be enhanced in eH response as the lipase-like protein PAD4 (At3g52430) and the NPR1-interacting protein NIMIN2 (At3g25882) inductions were found to be clearly specific or enhanced in response to eH. e2-specific repression, at the transcriptional level of few ethylene-related genes in at least one replicate (At5g25190, At5g61590, At5g47220, and At2g27050) may suggest also an enhanced ET pathway in eH response.. . . Cell division and expansion regulation. Four genes involved in cell growth and cycle control display e2-specific or e2-enhanced induction: the annexin ANN4 (At2g38750), the expansin EXP16 (At3g55500), a caldesmon-related protein (At1g52410), and a nodulin mtN3 family protein (At5g23660). The genes At4g02330 encoding a putative pectinesterase and FLA9 (At1g03870) encoding a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein were specifically repressed in the e2 response. The gene SEN4 (At4g30270) encoding an endo-xyloglucan endo1,4-beta glucanase was more repressed by e2 than by eH.. Lastly, several auxin-related genes were differentially affected by eH and e2 isolates in at least one replicate. These include genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, such as nitrilase NIT1 (At3g44310) and myrosinase-binding proteins (At1g52000, At2g39330), which were more repressed in response to eH than to e2. Genes involved in auxin response (At1g16510, At2g33830) were also repressed in response to the eH isolate. In particular, the gene At2g33830 encoding a dormancy/auxin-associated protein, previously reported as induced by eH inoculation, showed lower expression in response to eH than to e2..
PMC1779593	Results. To generalize this conclusion, 137 metabolites were profiled using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy. The amplitudes of the diurnal changes in metabolite levels in pgm were (with the exception of sugars) similar or smaller than in the wild type. The average levels shifted towards those found after several days of darkness in the wild type. Examples include increased levels of amino acids due to protein degradation, decreased levels of fatty acids, increased tocopherol and decreased myo-inositol. Many metabolite-transcript correlations were found and the proportion of transcripts correlated with sugars increased dramatically in the starchless mutant..
PMC4955218	Results. Three types of pretreatment dependent responses were observed: (1) The CBF-regulon controlled gene COR15A was stronger activated only after long-term cold pretreatment. (2) The non-chloroplast specific stress markers PAL1 and CHS were more induced by cold after long-term and slightly stronger expressed after short-term cold priming. (3) The chloroplast ROS signaling marker genes ZAT10 and BAP1 were less activated by the triggering stimulus in primed plants.. The effects on ZAT10 and BAP1 were more pronounced in 24h cold-primed plants than in 14day long cold-primed ones demonstrating independence of priming from induction and persistence of primary cold acclimation responses. Transcript and protein abundance analysis and studies in specific knock-out lines linked the priming-specific regulation of ZAT10 and BAP1 induction to the priming-induced long-term regulation of stromal and thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase (sAPX and tAPX) expression..
PMC3130182	Results. . Functional comparison of green microalgal BKTs in an E. coli system. beta-Carotene ketolase is the rate-limiting enzyme for astaxanthin biosynthesis in transgenic plants (Zhu et al., 2008). To engineer an efficient biosynthetic pathway in plants, a search was conducted for novel BKT cDNAs from green microalgae encoding enzymes with high efficiency for converting zeaxanthin to astaxanthin. The functionality of BKT cDNAs from the green microalgae H. pluvialis (HpBKT3) (Huang et al., 2006a), C. zofingiensis (CzBKT) (Huang et al., 2006b), and C. reinhardtii (CrBKT) (Lohr et al., 2005) were compared using beta-carotene or zeaxanthin as substrate in E. coli. The results are summarized in Table 2. All the three BKT enzymes are able to convert beta-carotene to canthaxanthin via echinenone efficiently with the C. zofingiensis BKT having lower efficiency. However, the BKT function varied greatly in ketolating zeaxanthin to astaxanthin. H. pluvialis BKT3 catalysed this reaction poorly and the C. zofingiensis BKT moderately. In contrast, high activity for zeaxanthin conversion (85% conversion rate) was found for C. reinhardtii BKT. Therefore, HpBKT3 is a beta-carotene ketolase while CzBKT and CrBKT are beta-carotene/zeaxanthin ketolases.. . Table 2.. .

Carotenoids accumulated in a strain of E. coli harbouring the plasmid pACCAR16deltacrtX or pACCAR25deltacrtX (Missawa et al., 1990), which accumulate, respectively, beta-carotene or zeaxanthin. Car, beta-carotene; Ech, echeninone; Can, canthaxanthin; Zea, zeaxanthin; Ado, adonixanthin; Ast, astaxanthin; pHPBKT3, pCZBKT, and pCRBKT represent pBluescript II KS vectors harbouring H. pluvialis BKT3, C. zofingiensis BKT, and modified C. reinhardtii BKT, respectively.. . . . . . Construction of transgenic A. thaliana overexpressing different BKT cDNAs. To address whether the functionality of BKT enzymes is the limiting step for plants to accumulate astaxanthin, three expression cassettes were constructed containing each of the BKT coding sequences fused to the transit peptide sequence of A. thaliana ribulose-1,5-biosphosphate carboxylase small subunit 1 (RBCS1) and driven by the cauliflour mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (Fig. 2A). The constructs, namely pHpBKT3, pCzBKT, and pCrBKT, were delivered to wild-type A. thaliana by the Agrobacterium-mediated method. Transformations per construct generated 48, 42, and 47 kanamycin-resistant lines, respectively. Marked differences in performance of the BKTs were observed in terms of the transgenic plant phenotypes (Fig. 2B). pHpBKT3 transformants had the same green leaves as wild type. pCzBKT transformants exhibited a light-green leaf pigmentation, whereas pCrBKT transformants displayed reddish brown leaves, inflorescence, and flowers (Fig. 2B, CR-5). Encouraged by these results, pCrBKT was also introduced into zeaxanthin-accumulating A. thaliana (npq2 mutant) due to a mutation in the zeaxanthin epoxidase gene (ZEP) to investigate whether zeaxanthin is a preferred precursor for astaxanthin (Fig.1). Thirty-three transgenic lines of npq2 plants were obtained which also showed reddish brown leaves. Selected transformants HP-13 directed from HpBKT3, CZ-3 from CzBKT, two lines, named CR-4 and CR-5, from CrBKT, and a transformant of the npq2 line named NPQ2-9 were further analysed. Transcripts of BKT genes were detected by RT-PCR in all transgenic lines but were absent as expected in non-transformed controls (Fig. 2C).. . Fig. 2.. .

Error bars indicate SEM.. . . . . . Carotenoid composition of transgenic A. thaliana. To reveal the functionality of the various BKTs in A. thaliana, the carotenoid composition in the leaves (4 weeks old) of representative transgenic lines was analysed. The results are listed in Table 3. No ketocarotenoids were found in leaves of wild type or npq2 controls or in transgenic lines overexpressing the H. pluvialis BKT3 (Table 3). In contrast, astaxanthin and other ketocarotenoids mainly adonixanthin, adonirubin, and canthaxanthin were detected in the leaves of transformants carrying either the C. zofingiensis or the C. reinhardtii BKT (Table 3). The reddish leaves of CR-4 and CR-5 lines accumulated larger amounts of the red pigment astaxanthin [1.37 and 0.85 mg g-1 (DW)] together with other ketocarotenoids. Astaxanthin and other ketocarotenoids are the major carotenoids in the leaves of CR-4 and CR-5 accounting for 75% and 73% of total carotenoid, respectively. The transformants of the npq2 line (NPQ2-9) accumulated even higher amounts of astaxanthin (2.07 mg g-1 DW) and total ketocarotenoids (4.51 mg g-1 DW). Astaxanthin existed predominantly in a free form (84-96%) with the rest being in monoester or diester form in young leaves. Astaxanthin from the transformants was identified mainly as the trans-isomer (95%) with minor amounts of 9-cis- and 13-cis-isomers according to the method of Yuan and Chen (1999b). Surprisingly, all the transformants with C. reinhardtii BKT accumulated much more total carotenoids than wild type, e.g. NPQ2-9 accumulated total carotenoids up to 4.82 mg g-1 DW, which is >2-fold higher than in wild type. Much lower amounts of ketocarotenoids and astaxanthin were synthesized in the C. zofingiensis BKT transformants. CR-4 was detected as a heterozygous line harbouring a T-DNA insertion at the +3530 bp site of the Toc159 gene, which is required for the quantitative import of photosynthetic proteins (Bauer et al., 2000). Its homozygous plant had an albino phenotype and did not survive.. . Table 3.. . Carotenoid content (mg g-1 DW of tissues) in leaves of wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis. . . . . . Wild-type.

Since astaxanthin was not sequestrated by esterification, this non-native pigment may be specifically recruited into photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes as is the case for non-native capsanthin and capsorubin in transfected tobacco leaves (Kumagai et al., 1998). To prove this expectation, the location of ketocarotenoids was determined by analysing the pigment composition of different photosynthetic complexes and the result is shown in Table 4. As expected, ketocarotenoids were only found in monomers and trimers of light harvesting centre II (LHCII), the complexes of PSII antenna.. . Table 4.. .

The increase in total carotenoid content in CrBKT transformants may be due to a transcriptional deregulation of the pathway resulting from the engineered formation of ketocarotenoids as observed before for tobacco plastid transformants (Hasunuma et al., 2008). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the transcript levels of PSY, PDS, and CRTISO in CrBKT transformants are 2- to 3-fold that in wild type (Fig. 2D). An increase in other carotenogenic genes including 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS3), and beta-carotene hydroxylase1 (CHY1) was not statistically significant.. During ageing, the green leaves of wild-type A. thaliana gradually turned yellow. In contrast to wild type, CR-4 and CR-5 developed orange senescent leaves. Carotenoid composition and content in senescent leaves of wild type and CR-5 were analysed and shown in Fig. 3A. Carotenoid content is lower in both wild-type and transgenic senescent leaves than in young leaves. However, senescent leaves of CR-5 transformant kept 70% of total carotenoids of young leaves with 85% being ketocarotenoids, whereas wild-type senescent leaves maintained only 30% of total carotenoids of young leaves (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, 88% of astaxanthin was found in ester forms in CR-5 senescent leaves; in contrast, astaxanthin was found predominantly in free form in young leaves (Fig. 3A, Table 3). To locate the storage site of astaxanthin and adonixanthin, cryostat microtome section was performed for senescent leaves (7 weeks old) of wild type and CR-5 at a similar site on their rosettes. The wild-type leaves contained only some yellow grains, whereas CR-5 contained many more grains in red (Fig. 3B). In senescent leaves, chloroplasts degenerate to gerontoplasts with the disappearance of thylakoids and an increase in plastoglobulins (PGs) that contain a variety of compounds including carotenoids (Biswal et al., 2003). TEM study showed that many more PGs occurred in CR-5 gerontoplasts than in wild-type ones (Fig. 3B). This result indicated that esterified astaxanthin might be stored in PGs together with other carotenoid esters.. . Fig. 3.. .

It is interesting to investigate the ketocarotenogenesis in seeds that contain different content and profiles of carotenoids from leaves. The carotenoids from mature seeds of wild type, npq2, CZ-3, CR-5, and NPQ2-9 were measured by HPLC (Table 5). A. thaliana contains much lower amounts of total carotenoids in seeds (e.g. 32.63 mug g-1 DW in wild type and 66.62 mug g-1 DW in npq2) than in leaves (2110 mug g-1 DW in wild type and 2260 mug g-1 DW in npq2). Total carotenoids in the transformants were 2-fold higher than controls with about half being ketocarotenoids and a quarter being astaxanthin. The efficiency of astaxanthin biosynthesis in seeds of C. reinhardtii BKT transformants was much lower than in leaves, possibly resulting from the different status of BKT cofactors between the two organs.. .

Growth, photosynthesis, and high-light tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis plants. To study the impact of carotenoid alteration in leaves on plant growth and photosynthesis, the maximum diameter, chlorophyll content, and the photosynthetic parameter Fv/Fm were measured for maximum quantum yield of wild type and transgenic CR-4 and CR-5 plants grown at 22 C under a light intensity of 250 mumol m-2 s-1 (Table 6). Compared with the wild type, the values for all these parameters were slightly but not significantly lower for the transformants. This result indicates that the drastic changes in carotenoid composition do not affect photosynthesis and growth of the transgenic plants.. . Table 6.. .

Astaxanthin was proposed to protect algal cells from high-light stress (Wang et al., 2003). To investigate whether the accumulation of astaxanthin and other ketocarotenoids confers any improvement in stress tolerance, the amount of MDA, a product of the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, as stress indicator (Davison et al., 2002) was determined in wild-type, CR-4, and CR-5 plants exposed to high light (1000 mumol m-2 s-1). As shown in Table 6, the mean values for wild type, CR-4, and CR-5 were 16.43, 9.28, and 9.71 ng cm-2 leaf area, respectively. This resembles at least a 40% decrease in lipid peroxidation in the transgenic lines, indicating higher tolerance of CR-4 and CR-5 to high-light stress than wild type..
PMC4200376	Results. . Mutants in the Arabidopsis pectin acetylesterase gene family have walls with increased acetate content and reduced inflorescence stem growth. The A. thaliana genome contains 12 annotated CE13 genes [Fig.1; CAZY.org; (Henrissat et al. 2001)]. Based on the availability of T-DNA insertion lines with altered gene expression, the function of nine of those genes (At2g46930, At3g09410, At3g62060, At4g19410, At4g19420, At5g23870, At5g26670, At5g45280, At3g05910) was investigated. Gene expression in mutant lines was established by RT-PCR and at least one line per gene showed reduced expression (Table1; Fig.2). Since rosette leaves are rich in pectic polymers (Zablackis et al. 1995) this tissue was chosen for biochemical analyses. Wall material of 5- to 6-week-old leaves was prepared and its alkali labile acetate content determined (Table1). Some T-DNA lines affected in gene expression exhibited a significant alteration/increase in acetate content including pae3-2 (SALK_137505C), pae7-2 (GABI_272B08) pae8 (At4g19420; SALK_132026), pae9-1 (At5g23870; SALK_046973C), pae9-2 (At5g23870; GABI_803G08) and pae11-2 (GABI_505H02). PAEs, whose second allel mutants represent a knock-down rather than a knockout allel (PAE3; PAE5; PAE7), or where one or both of the allels did not display a statistically significant increase in acetate content (PAE6, PAE10, PAE11, PAE12) were due to their genetic inconsistencies not further pursued here. Should more knock-out lines become available in the future many of those PAE would certainly be of interest for a follow-up.Fig.1Phylogenetic tree of gene family related to a pectin acetylesterase.

PTB-housekeeping gene. WT=Col-0 plants of same age as insertion lines being tested. Primers used for each reaction are listed in Suppl. Table S2. Two knockout alleles of PAE9 were available (Figs.2, 3a). When leaf material was tested for altered wall acetate content an approximate 20% increase was found in both mutant alleles (Fig.4a). Three independent PAE9 overexpression lines in the pae9-1 background revealed complementation of the wall acetate back to WT levels. The overexpression lines were shown to have at least 3 times higher transcript levels than WT plants (Fig.3b). These results indicate that PAE9 is also responsible for modulating leaf wall acetate levels.Fig.3Gene models for PAE8 and PAE9 and Q-RT-PCR of complementation and overexpression lines. a Gene model for PAE8 and PAE9;. boxes indicate exons (gray, translated regions); black line in between exons indicate introns.

Error bars indicate standard deviation; letters indicate statistical significant differences based on one-way ANOVA (P<0.05); n4. Since only one pae8 knock-out allel was available (Table1; Fig.3a), genetic complementation of this pae8 mutant was performed by transforming the genomic WT PAE8 sequence under the control of the native PAE8 promoter into the mutant. Three independently obtained T3 complementation lines were subjected to Q-RT-PCR analysis confirming that the PAE transcript was expressed (Fig.3b). The pae8 mutant exhibited an approximate 20% acetate increase in its leaf walls compared to WT (Fig.4a). The complementation lines were shown to rescue the mutant phenotype, i.e. wall acetate levels were reduced down to WT levels (Fig.4a). These data demonstrate that PAE8 modulates the wall acetate level of leaves.. A double mutant, pae8/pae9-2, was generated and analysis indicated a 37% increase in total wall acetate content (Fig.4a), a near additive level compared to the two single mutants.. No morphological changes could be observed in the rosette leaves of these Arabidopsis mutants. However, publically available gene expressiondata indicated a high expression of both PAE8 and PAE9 in the lower internode of Arabidopsis inflorescences (Fig. S1). Indeed, upon examining the inflorescence height of 35-day-old Arabidopsis plants a reduction was observed for pae8 (10%; Fig.5a, b) and the pae8/pae9-2 double mutant (21%; Fig.5a, b). The complementation lines for pae8 restored inflorescence heights to WT levels (Fig.5b). The double mutant exhibited twice the reduction in height of the one exhibited by the pae8 single mutant suggesting an additive effect caused by the pae9-2 mutation even though no consistent height reduction was found for the PAE9 mutants. Due to this developmental alteration acetate content was determined in the stem lower internode of the lines, but no differences in acetate content could be observed between the mutant lines and WT (Fig.5c).Fig.5Inflorescence stem heights and stem acetate content. a General appearance of 35-day-old Arabidopsis plants; white bar 5cm. b Inflorescence height in cm; n26. c Acetate content in the second internode of 35-day-old stems; n6. Error bars indicate standard deviation; letters indicate statistical significant differences based on one-way ANOVA (P<0.05). . . The pae8 and pae9 mutants have increased pectin acetate content. An attempt was made to identify the wall polymer with enhanced acetyl-substituents in the pae8 and pae9 mutants. Since VrPAE1 has been shown to have pectin acetylesterase activity (Bordenave et al. 1995; Breton et al. 1996) the initial investigation focused on the pectic polysaccharides. An enzymatic pectin digest was performed on leaf wall material to extract pectic polymers and its alkali labile acetate content was determined. Indeed, the pectic extracts derived from pae8, pae9-1, pae9-2 and pae8/pae9-2 exhibited an increased acetate content compared to WT (Fig.4b). In the PAE8 complementation lines and in the PAE9 overexpression lines in the pae9-1 background the acetate content was equal to WT levels (Fig.4b). The monosaccharide composition of the pectic extract of the various mutant lines revealed as expected a dominance in galacturonic acid and rhamnose (Tables2, 3, Supplemental Fig.S2) indicative of pectins. However, a reduction in the rhamnose content of pae8 (-12%) and pae8/pae9-2 (-17%) in the pectin extracts was observed, but not galacturonic acid, suggesting that RGI in these mutants could be less extractable.Table2Rhamnose content of cell wall, pectin extract, residue and fractions in pae8, pae9 and double mutant (mgg-1 cell wall)WT. pae9-1. . pae9-2. . pae9-1/ox9-1. pae9-1/ox9-2. pae9-1/ox9-3. pae8. . pae8/comp-1. pae8/comp-2. pae8/comp-3. pae8/pae9-2Cell wall21.751.9721.440.7421.521.1823.610.6422.971.6022.11.0520.88*1.5921.460.8721.940.5521.523.7220.511.12Pectin extract12.560.5812.250.3713.913.8915.23*0.2714.68*0.4711.862.5111.04*0.7111.530.7211.740.6612.10.5110.37*0.60Pectin residue9.471.6311.490.5410.860.6610.691.5510.841.6310.580.689.331.477.650.937.790.568.680.1512.541.31Fraction I3.200.403.340.192.840.424.00*0.112.850.343.040.042.650.15Fraction II2.970.662.170.091.930.203.110.182.620.343.740.351.77*0.19Fraction III2.670.162.650.082.490.203.05*0.042.540.102.630.142.33*0.09Fraction IV0.540.080.570.050.520.010.600.100.500.100.500.050.490.03Fraction Vn.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.The entire monosaccharide composition of these fractions can be found in Figs.

The remaining wall residue after pectin extraction was also analyzed for acetate content (Fig.4b). All remaining residues still contained acetate with changes among the different mutants that were similar to the pectin extracts. The monosaccharide analysis of these residues revealed still the presence of the pectic monosaccharides rhamnose and galacturonic acid demonstrating that the enzymatic pectin extraction conditions used did not lead to the entire solubilisation of pectins and thus removal from the residues (Tables2, 3; Fig. S2c).. The origin of the increase of pectic acetate in the mutants was investigated by fractionation of the pectic extract through size exclusion chromatography (Fig.6). Distinct peaks were observed for pectic fragments of different molecular weights. The eluted pectic compounds were pooled into five fractions as indicated in Fig.6. Monosaccharide analysis of the pectin fractions indicates a qualitative separation of pectic domains (Tables2, 3; Fig. S3; Fig. S4). Fractions I and II contain large molecules (fraction I>147.5kDa; fraction II 147.5-23kDa; Fig.6), which are enriched for monosaccharides present in RGI structures (galacturonic acid, rhamnose, arabinose and galactose). The ratio between galacturonic acid and rhamnose in fractions I and II is larger than 1 suggesting that these fractions also contain HG. Fraction III (23.2-4.6kDa) is enriched with galacturonic acid when compared to fractions I and II, however, still containing monosaccharides representative of RGI. In fractions IV (4.6-1.5kDa) and V (1.5-0.6kDa) the abundance of galacturonic acid suggests small homogalacturonan fragments. The concentration of sugars in each fraction is also consistent with the chromatogram profiles obtained (Tables2, 3; Fig.6; Fig. S3; Fig. S4). Based on the content of acetate per galacturonic acid the degree of acetylation of the polymers in the large-molecular-weight fractions is higher than the lower molecular weight fractions (Tables3, 4; Fig. S3; Fig. S4). Similar chromatograms (Fig.6) and monosaccharide content (Tables2, 3; Fig. S3; Fig. S4) were obtained for the WT and the various mutant lines indicating that no detectable change occurred in the overall pectic polymer size of the single mutants.Fig.6Size exclusion chromatography of pectic extracts.

In pae8 all fractions with the exception of fraction III exhibit a significant increase in acetate content (Table4), while the corresponding complementation lines restored the fractions acetate to WT levels (Table4). In contrast, the pae9 mutants display an increase in acetate specifically in fraction I by approximately 30% (Table4). The PAE9 overexpression lines in the pae9-1 background show that acetate in this fraction is restored to WT levels (Table4).. The pae8/pae9-2 double mutant exhibits increased acetate phenotypes in all fractions with the exception of fraction III, which is in agreement with an additive phenotype of the single mutants (Table4). In the double mutant the rhamnose content is also reduced in fractions II (40% reduction) and III (13% reduction) as is the galacturonic acid content in fraction II [(30% reduction); Tables2, 3; Fig. S3b, c]. All results are consistent with the proposed pectin acetylesterase activities.. . . Recombinant PAE8 and PAE9 release acetate from mutant pectin fractions in vitro. In vitro activity assays of heterologously expressed proteins were performed to investigate the biochemical activity for PAE8 and PAE9. Both proteins were tagged (6XHis) and transiently expressed in N. benthamiana (Figs.7b, 8b). The chimeric PAE8 and PAE9 proteins were purified using affinity chromatography, and as a control the empty vector (EV) protein extract was processed in the same manner. Both proteins expressed with slightly higher molecular weights (~55kDa) than the predicted sizes of 45.3 and 46.8kDa for PAE8 and PAE9, respectively (Figs.7b, 8b). As expected, no His-tagged proteins were detected in empty vector transformed tobacco (Figs.7b, 8b).Fig.7PAE8 releases acetate in vitro from pae8 pectin fractions. a Percentage acetate released from pectin fractions (I-V) and Amorphophallus konjac acetylated glucomannan by heterologously expressed PAE8.

In vitro activity assays were designed to investigate pectin acetylesterase activity by utilizing the pectin fractions derived from the mutants as substrates (Fig.6). When PAE8 and PAE9 were incubated with the corresponding mutant pectic fractions, acetate was released from fractions I and II, but not from other fractions (Figs.7a, 8a; Table S1). PAE9 was able to release more acetate from its corresponding substrate in vitro than PAE8. The observed activities are consistent with the phenotypes of increased acetate found in the pectic fractions I and II of pae8 and pae9 mutants (Table4), but not for pae8 in fractions IV and V (Table4).. The transcriptome analysis of the developing corms of Amorphophallus konjac revealed the presence of an acetylesterase within the 100 most abundant transcripts that have high protein sequence similarity to PAE8 [VLAE, vodoo lily acetyl esterase; Fig.1; (Gille et al. 2011a)]. Since Amorphophallus konjac contains mainly O-acetylated glucomannan as a storage polymer (Chua et al. 2010; Li et al. 2005) this protein was designated as a putative glucomannan O-esterase [Fig.1; (Gille et al. 2011a)]. Hence O-acetylated glucomannan was also tested as a substrate for PAE8 and PAE9. However, neither enzyme exhibited any activity against this substrate under the conditions tested (Figs.7a, 8a)..
PMC3321683	3.. Results. . (a). The shy2-101 mutation inhibits lateral root primordium development and lateral root emergence but increases the number of lateral root founder cells. The shy2-101 mutant was screened from EMS-mutagenized Col M2 seedlings and selected based on having fewer LRs than wild-type (figure 1a). Genetic and sequence analyses showed that shy2-101 has a gain-of-function mutation in domain II of IAA3 that changes the 70th amino acid from proline to serine (P70S), thereby stabilizing the IAA3 protein in a manner similar to the shy2-2 mutation [38] (figure 1c). As observed in the other gain-of-function shy2 mutants (shy2-2, shy2-3) isolated from the Ler background [30], shy2-101 showed a dwarf shoot phenotype with curled-up leaves and an abnormal gravitropic response in the root (data not shown). Because most of the auxin-related mutants and reporter lines in Arabidopsis are produced in the Col accession, the shy2-101 allele will be useful in comparing phenotype and reporter expression with other mutants isolated in the Col background as described below.. Figure1.Lateral root (LR) formation is inhibited by the gain-of-function shy2/iaa3 mutants. (a,b) 10-day-old seedlings of Col and shy2-101 (a), and those of Ler and shy2-2 (b). Scale bar = 10 mm. (c) Amino acid sequences of the conserved region in domain II of the SHY2/IAA3 protein. The shy2-101 mutation changes the 70th amino acid from proline to serine (P70S), whereas the shy2-2 mutation changes the 69th amino acid from proline to serine (P69S) [30]. (d,e) Primary root length (d) and emerged LR number (e) of Col, shy2-101, Ler and shy2-2 seedlings at 10 days after germination (n = 15). Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate a statistical difference (*p < 0.01 by a two-sided t-test).. First, we compared the primary root length and number of LRs in 10-day-old wild-type Col and shy2-101 seedlings grown under standard conditions (constant light, 1 MS medium). Compared with wild-type Col, the primary root length of shy2-101 seedlings was shorter (figure 1a,d). In addition, shy2-101 seedlings had no emerged LRs, whereas the wild-type seedlings had many LRs (figure 1a,e). These shy2-101 phenotypes were similar to those of the shy2-2 mutant in Ler (figure 1b,d,e); however, the degree of primary root growth inhibition was higher in shy2-101 (root growth was 51.3% of Col root length) than in the shy2-2 (root growth was 77.9% of Ler root length), suggesting an accession-specific effect on the shy2 mutant phenotype. The LR density (number of emerged LR per portion of the primary root where LRs are present) was zero in both shy2 mutant alleles, indicating that SHY2/IAA3-mediated auxin signalling is important for LR formation.. Next, we examined whether LR primordium formation occurred in the shy2-101 mutant. The 12-day-old seedlings were cleared, and non-emerged LR primordia were observed microscopically. In the Col, a few LR initiation sites were observed in the distal primary root region where asymmetric cell divisions occur (figure 2a). In contrast, the shy2-101 roots had more LR initiation sites in the same distal root region but subsequent periclinal cell divisions were inhibited (figure 2b). Interestingly, in the proximal regions of the shy2-101 primary root, many early-stage LR primordia were observed but LR emergence was significantly inhibited (figure 2c,d). These results strongly suggest that the shy2-101 mutation increases the number of LR initiation events with anticlinal cell divisions of xylem pole pericycle, but inhibits/retards subsequent LR primordium development and LR emergence. Similar LR phenotypes were also observed in shy2-2 (data not shown), confirming that SHY2/IAA3-mediated auxin signalling is important for LR primordium development and LR emergence in both Col and Ler genetic backgrounds..

(a-d) Nomarski images of Col (a) and shy2-101 (b-d) primary roots at 12 days after germination (DAG).

(b). The shy2-101 mutation increases the number of lateral root initiation sites expressing LBD16/ASL18, a key gene for lateral root initiation. To determine whether the shy2-101 mutation increases the activity of LR initiation genes, we monitored the expression of the pLBD16::GUS reporter that was constructed in the Col background [25]. LBD16/ASL18 is one of the direct target genes activated by ARF7 and ARF19 and functions in LR formation downstream of ARF7/ARF19 [25]. In 7-day-old wild-type Col seedlings, pLBD16::GUS was specifically expressed in the LR founder cells and LR initiation sites along the xylem pole pericycle (figure 2e) [25]. This strong GUS activity was never observed in the slr-1/iaa14 mutant (Goh et al. 2011, unpublished results). Surprisingly, 7-day-old shy2-101 seedlings already had many LR initiation sites with pLBD16::GUS activity (figure 2f). These results indicate that the shy2-101 mutation significantly increases LR initiation events with the activation of LBD16, suggesting that SHY2/IAA3-mediated auxin signalling is necessary for inhibiting LR initiation in the pericycle cells.. The shy2-101 mutation also inhibited LR primordium development and LR emergence after LR initiation in 12-day-old seedlings (figure 2), whereas at 15 days post-germination the shy2-101 mutation often caused clustered LRs, where numerous LRs emerged from a limited region of the primary root (figure 3a). We hypothesize that these clustered LRs are already initiated at a younger age and eventually develop LR primordia and emerge at an older age.. Figure3.Genetic interactions between shy2-101 and slr-1, arf7-1 and arf19-1. (a) 15-day-old seedlings of shy2-101, shy2-101 slr-1, and shy2-101 arf7-1 arf19-1 mutants. Scale bar = 10 mm. (b) Nomarski images of roots from shy2-101, shy2-101 slr-1, and shy2-101 arf7-1 arf19-1 mutants at 9 days after germination. Enhanced lateral root (LR) initiation in shy2-101 is blocked by the slr-1 mutation or the arf7 arf19 double mutation. Blue arrowheads indicate LR initiation sites, and black arrowheads show pericycle cell layers adjacent to the xylem pole. Scale bar = 100 m.. . . (c). Enhanced lateral root initiation in shy2-101 is dependent on activation of the SLR/IAA14-ARF7-ARF19 auxin-signalling module. The SLR/IAA14-ARF7-ARF19 auxin-signalling module is necessary for LR initiation [9,18,20,24,25]. To determine whether enhanced LR initiation in shy2-101 depends on the SLR/IAA14-ARF7-ARF19 auxin-signalling module, we constructed the shy2-101 slr-1 double and shy2-101 arf7-1 arf19-1 triple mutants in the Col background, and analysed their LR phenotype. As shown in figure 3, the shy2-101 slr-1 double-mutant seedlings had no LR initiation sites, resulting in the slr-1-like LR phenotype in 15-day-old seedlings (figure 3a,b). These observations indicate that the slr-1 mutation blocks the enhanced LR initiation in shy2-101. Similarly, the 15-day-old shy2-101 arf7-1 arf19-1 triple-mutant seedlings had no LRs, whereas the shy2-101 seedlings had clustered LRs (figure 3a). There were no LR initiation sites in either shy2-101 slr-1 or shy2-101 arf7-1 arf19-1 primary roots (figure 3b). These results also indicate that the enhanced LR initiation in the shy2-101 mutant is dependent on activation of the SLR/IAA14-ARF7-ARF19 signalling module, suggesting that the shy2-101 mutation acts on LR formation downstream of SLR/IAA14-ARF7-ARF19 module-dependent LR initiation.. . . (d). The shy2 mutations strongly elevate endogenous indole-3-acetic acid level in the roots. Our genetic evidence that enhanced LR initiation in the shy2-101 mutant depends on the SLR/IAA14-ARF7-ARF19 auxin-signalling module suggests the possibility that the shy2 mutant might contain higher auxin levels in the roots, thereby increasing the number of LR initiation sites. To clarify this point, we measured endogenous IAA levels in the roots of 7-day-old wild-type and shy2 seedlings by LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis (see 2). As shown in figure 4, both the shy2-101 (in Col background) and shy2-2 (in Ler background) mutants contained a higher level of endogenous IAA in the roots, compared with their corresponding wild-types. Particularly, the shy2-101 roots had a much higher IAA level than shy2-2, suggesting differences in the genetic background between the Ler and Col accessions (figure 4). These results indicate that the shy2 gain-of-function mutations increased endogenous auxin levels in roots, strongly suggesting that elevated auxin levels promoted LR initiation and resulted in the increased number of LR initiation sites in the shy2-101 mutant.. Figure4.Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels in wild-type and shy2 mutant plants. IAA levels (ng gfw-1) in the roots of the 7-day-old wild-type (Col and Ler) and shy2 (shy2-101 and shy2-2) mutant seedlings are shown (n = 4). Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate a statistical difference (*p < 0.01 by a two-sided t-test). Experiments were repeated twice, and similar values were obtained in each experiment..
PMC2664332	Results. . MPSS Signatures of Antisense Transcripts Are Associated with MiRNA Targets. The digital and normalized nature of Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data enables one to mathematically analyze the expression relationship of all transcriptional signatures (e.g. sense and antisense) both within and between samples. We analyzed the abundances of sense and antisense signatures for miRNA targets from the MPSS Plus Database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at) [25],[26]. A scalar value was calculated representing the abundance of antisense signatures divided by that of total signatures for a given gene. Thirteen out of the total seventeen MPSS libraries showed a higher percentage of normalized antisense signatures associated with the experimentally validated miRNA targets (n=94, Tables 1, S1 and S2) than for paralogous non-targets (n=140). The paralog genes included fourteen experimentally verified non-miRNA-targets [19],[27] and were chosen as biological controls based on the presence of a remnant pseudo-miRNA binding site that presumably does not associate with a miRNA because of sequence divergence (see Materials and Methods). For the six inflorescence libraries (the INF, INS, AP1, SAP, AP3 and AGM samples in Table 1), five had a greater abundance of normalized antisense signatures for validated targets than did paralogs, and the higher expression in the INS library was significant (P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model). Other tissues, including callus, leaf, root, silique and seedling (the CAS, LES, ROS, SIS, GSE libraries in Table 1) showed the correlation of higher antisense expression for validated targets as well, arguing against a tissue-specific bias for these antisense transcripts despite high levels of miRNAs in flowers [20]. It is noteworthy that all twelve signature method MPSS libraries (labeled by  in Table 1) gave higher normalized antisense signatures for validated miRNA targets, whereas four out of five of the classic method libraries did not (labeled by * in Table 1), raising questions about possible technical bias in the classic MPSS datasets as noted (http://mpss.udel.edu/at/). Discounting the classic method signature data, a combined statistical analysis of the signature method libraries showed that validated miRNA targets have significantly higher normalized antisense transcript expression than their paralog genes (P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model, Tables 1 and S2). The TAS1-TAS4 genes are targets of miR173, miR390 or miR828 and they require antisense transcription to generate ta-siRNAs [19],[28]. When these target genes were removed from the analysis, the average normalized antisense signature abundance for the validated miRNA targets in all 17 libraries increased (data not shown), demonstrating that antisense transcription of non-TAS miRNA target genes is substantial. Our observations suggest that mechanisms similar to those operating in the production of ta-siRNAs may also act on many bona fide miRNA targets previously concluded to be intransitive [20].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.t001.

Sum of abundance for mRNA antisense signatures (classes 3 and 6, transcript per million) was collected from the MPSS Plus Database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at/, Table S2).

Whole Genome Tiling Microarray Transcriptome Data Reveal a Correlation between Antisense Transcription and MiRNA Target Sites. The high percentage of MPSS normalized antisense signatures for the validated miRNA targets prompted us to perform a systematic survey of antisense transcription for miRNA targets and MIRNA genes. We collectively plotted the sense and antisense transcript abundance as a function of miRNA cleavage sites for validated targets (n=78), predicted targets (n=188), non-target paralogs (n=120), and the miRNA* sites of MIRNA genes (as potential cleavage sites by miRNAs [29], n=159) (See Text S1 and Table S3). This analysis excluded PPR genes, ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1), DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) (which harbors MIR838 within intron 14), and the ARF2/3/4 targets of ta-siRNAs derived from miR390 cleavage of TAS3 (AT3G17185), because these are reported evidence for miRNA target-associated transitivity [16],[20],[23],[28]. Figure 1 presents the sense and antisense strand expression as a function of the miRNA target sites. We identified a pair of expression peaks associated with validated miRNA targets flanking the miRNA cleavage site on the sense and antisense strands, which was not seen in paralogs relative to their cryptic pseudo miRNA-binding sites (Figure 1A and D). For the validated targets, an expression peak was observed immediately downstream of the miRNA cleavage site on the sense strand (Figure 1A open arrow, referred to as downstream sense signal hereafter). This could be a manifestation of higher stability of the 3 RISC cleavage fragment for miRNA target mRNAs. This interpretation is consistent with previous reports describing the accumulation of 3 endonucleolytic cleavage products of miRNA targets by Northern blot [6], reverse genetic analysis [30], and deep sequencing of non-capped polyA+ degradome libraries [31],[32],[33]. Associated with this downstream sense signal was an additional peak of transcription signal located in a 200 n.t. region upstream of the miRNA target sites on the antisense strand (Figure 1A black arrow, referred to as upstream antisense signal hereafter). Figure S1 provides additional examples of this phenomenon for high downstream-sense coupled to corresponding upstream-antisense transcript signals around the miRNA binding site for twelve different miRNAs, in which target genes also produce smRNAs. For the predicted miRNA targets, an expression pattern similar to that of validated targets was observed spanning the predicted cleavage sites (Figure 1B, open arrow for downstream sense signal and black arrow for upstream antisense signal). Statistical analysis indicated that the downstream sense and upstream antisense signals were significantly higher than the average signal elsewhere on either sense or antisense strand for validated miRNA targets and predicted targets (P<0.01, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model; Table S3). The pairs of downstream sense and upstream antisense signals for the validated targets were significantly higher compared to the same region for paralogs (Table S4, 95% confidence interval calculated). In line with the recent report of miR172-mediated cleavage of the pri-miR172b transcripts [29], we observed some sense expression signals immediately downstream of the miRNA* sites of MIRNA genes along with some antisense expression signals immediately upstream of the miRNA* sites (Figure 1C). This implies that MIRNA genes may share the same process of antisense transcription with the validated miRNA targets, possibly by miRNA interaction with miRNA primary transcripts. These observations suggested a causal relationship between miRNA target site regulation and antisense transcripts of miRNA targets and MIRNA genes that warranted further study.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g001.

(A) Validated miRNA targets (n=78); (B) Predicted miRNA targets (n=188); (C) miRNA genes (n=159); (D) paralogous non-targets (n=120). Data was collected from two published whole genome tiling microarray experiments with five samples from Arabidopsis flowers, leaves, roots, and two suspension cultures [11],[13]. For validated and predicted targets, each data point on the plot is the average of the normalized total signal from five tissue samples spanning 800 n.t. upstream and downstream of the validated or predicted miRNA cleavage sites. For MIRNA genes or paralogous non-targets, data for the same length of region spanning miRNA* sites or pseudo-binding sites was plotted. Signals on the sense strand are indicated by gray line and open arrow, while antisense signals are displayed by black line and black arrow. In panel A, antisense signals within the 200 n.t. range upstream (black arrow) and sense signals within the 200 n.t. range downstream (open arrow) of the miRNA cleavage site (coordinate 0 on x-axis) for validated targets have significantly higher signal intensity than elsewhere on the plot and than those in the same region of paralogs (95% confidence interval, see Tables S3 and S4). In panel B, antisense signals within the 200 n.t. range upstream of the predicted miRNA cleavage site (black arrow) is also statistically higher than those in the same region of paralogs.. . . . . . MiRNA Target-Associated Antisense Transcripts Are Affected in SmRNA Pathway Mutants. With the confirmation by two pilot custom tiling microarray experiments that the upstream antisense expression for the validated miRNA targets was technically and biologically reproducible (see Text S1), we designed two custom 3 n.t. high resolution tiling microarrays (25mer and 36mer probe lengths; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to test the role of HEN1, DCL1, HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), RDR6 and SGS3 in production of antisense transcripts associated with validated miRNA targets. The 22 target genes on the arrays were chosen based on the presence or absence of associated smRNAs that mapped to the loci, on various amplitudes of the antisense transcription signals in published whole genome tiling microarray experiments [11],[13] (Table S3), and in order to provide a representative cross section of miRNA families. The sensitivity and precision of the custom high resolution tiling microarray to detect bona fide transcripts was evidenced by three sense strand analyses: (1) by excellent concordance of the sense strand signals of Col-0 inflorescence samples relative to the two independent whole genome tiling array transcriptome datasets (Figure S2), (2) by an absence of signals from probes corresponding to annotated introns (see Figure S2A, E, F), and (3) by the observation of reasonably good concordance for the changes in miRNA target gene sense strand expression in hen1-1 mutant versus Ler-0 wild type between the custom tiling microarray and published data [19] using ATH1 microarrays (Figure S3).. Having validated the custom tiling microarray sense strand signals, the antisense signals for the miRNA targets were characterized for smRNA pathway mutants. Sixteen out of 22 genes on the microarray showed clear antisense transcription signals usually falling within 200 n.t. range upstream and/or downstream of the miRNA cleavage sites (Table S6 and Figure S4). We employed normalized delta plots for antisense transcripts (to facilitate gene-by-gene analyses) representing the differences between the means of signal intensities for biological and technical replicates of smRNA pathway mutants versus corresponding wild-type controls divided by the signals from wild-type. Fourteen of these sixteen genes displayed different amplitude antisense signals in at least one of the five smRNA pathway mutants hen1-1, dcl1-7, hyl1-2, rdr6-15, and sgs3-14. Most strikingly, the antisense signals of thirteen genes were increased in hen1-1 mutants (Table S7). Figure 2 shows normalized delta plots for APS1/AT3G22890, MYB12/AT2G47460, AP2/AT4G36920, and GRF8/AT4G24150 antisense transcript signals which demonstrate 20-40% increases in hen1-1 relative to Ler-0 wild type (Figures 2A, B, E, F; Figures S5, S6, S7 and S8, black arrows). For SCL6(IV)/AT4G00150 and TOE2/AT5G60120, there were 1 to 2.5- fold increases relative to wild type (Figures 2C and D; Figures S9 and S10). In the dcl1-7 mutant, the relative expression levels of antisense transcripts for five genes were decreased by 20-40%, including APS1, MYB12, SCL6(IV), DCL1/AT1G01040, and SPL10/AT1G27370 (Figures 3, S5, S6, S9, S11, S12). The hyl1-2 mutant had decreased antisense transcript expression by 20-50% for APS1, MYB12, SCL6(IV) and TOE2 (Figures 4, S5, S6, S9, S10). Conversely, ARF17/AT1G77850 and MET2/AT4G14140 antisense transcript expression levels were up-regulated in hyl1-2 (Table S7, Figure S13), and there was a more complex pattern of expression for TCP4/AT3G15030 antisense transcripts that were elevated in the upstream region while decreased in the downstream region in hyl1-2 (Figure S14).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g002.

Each data point is the average signal of at least 3 technical samples and is represented by the difference between the signals from hen1-1 versus Ler-0 divided by that from Ler-0 [normalized delta delta signal, (mutant signal-wild type signal)/wild type signal]. The normalized delta signal is plotted as a function of probe position relative to the miRNA cleavage site (coordinate 0 on x-axis). Black arrow pinpoints the signals in the plot which were identified by probe sets containing at least 3 contiguous probes showing at least 20% differences (up or down, not both) for the normalized delta signals. The precise same region with changed signals, if any, is indicated by black arrows for other smRNA mutants in Figures 3-. . 6.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g003. Figure 3. .

Normalized delta signals for antisense transcripts of selected validated miRNA targets showing differences between hyl1-2 versus wild type Col-0.. Refer to Figure 2 for details of legend.. . . . Another striking observation was seen in the sgs3-14 mutant: APS1, MYB12, TOE2, DCL1, SPL10, and TCP4 had increased expression of antisense transcripts (Figures 5A, B, D; S5, S6, S11. S12, S14). For MYB12, SCL6(IV) and TCP4, there were some antisense transcripts with complex changes corresponding to increases as well as decreases (Figures 5B, C; S6, S9, S14). In the rdr6-15 mutant, MYB12, SCL6(IV), TOE2, and TCP4 antisense transcript expression was down-regulated, while there was an increase of UBC24/AT2G33770 antisense transcripts (Figures 6B-D; S6, S9, S10, S14, S15). Taken together, around 80% of the sixteen validated miRNA targets were elevated in the hen1-1 mutants for the antisense transcript expression, whereas about a quarter to one third of these 16 targets were affected in one of the other four smRNA pathway mutants, including dcl1-7, hyl1-2, rdr6-15 or sgs3-14. MYB12 and SCL6(IV) were affected by all five mutants in that there was elevated antisense transcript expression in hen1-1, complex up and down signal levels in sgs3-14, and decreased expression in dcl1-7, hyl1-2 and rdr6-15. Because the antisense transcript topologies were replicated precisely (i.e. in the same probe sets) in completely different sets of experiments with different control genotypes Landsberg erecta and Columbia (Ler-0, Col-0), we conclude that despite their low abundance relative to sense transcripts, the antisense transcripts mapping near to the miRNA binding sites of target genes are highly reproducible.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g005.

Normalized delta signals for antisense transcripts of selected validated miRNA targets showing differences between rdr6-15 versus wild type Col-0.. Refer to Figure 2 for details of legend.. . . . Some general features characterize the identified antisense transcripts: (1) the expression peaks appeared to be concordant with sense transcripts. For example, comparison between the wild type sense and antisense strand raw signals for AP2 and SPL10 showed that these genes with introns in the probe set had no antisense transcripts in the sense intronic region (Figures S2A, S4E, S2F, and Table S6). This suggested the antisense transcripts associated with miRNA targets were generated from the mature mRNA transcripts. Supporting evidence comes from APS1, AP2 and SPL10 which also had concordant changes in antisense signals to sense signals in smRNA pathway mutants (Figures S5, S7, S12). (2) The effect on antisense transcript abundance by smRNA pathway mutants did not strictly correlate with that of sense transcripts expression except for a few cases in hen1-1 and sgs3-14. For instance, elevated expression of DCL1 antisense transcripts in hen1-1 and sgs3-14 mutants was not correlated to that of sense transcripts which were unchanged in these two mutants (Figure S11). A similar situation was seen for MET2, where the antisense transcripts of MET2 were increased in the hyl1-2 mutant. Nevertheless, its sense transcript abundances were unchanged in the corresponding mutant (Figure S13). In some other cases, the antisense transcripts had reciprocal expression patterns compared to their cognate sense transcripts, for example, MYB12 in hyl1-2 and sgs3-14, SCL6(IV) in dcl1-7, sgs3-14 and rdr6-15, and TOE2 in hyl1-2 and rdr6-15 (Figures S6, S9, S10). This suggested a possible regulatory function of antisense transcripts on their coordinate sense transcripts. For hen1-1 mutants, most antisense transcripts of validated miRNA targets were elevated along with their sense transcripts. We interpret the increased antisense transcripts as an indirect consequence of the increased stability of their sense transcripts due to the loss of function of HEN1 in the mutant, because for some targets, such as DCL1 and MET2, the antisense transcripts were up-regulated whereas the levels of their sense transcripts did not change (Figures S11, S13). For CC-NBS-LRR/AT5G43740, the observed increases in antisense transcript abundance were accompanied by a concordant decrease of its cognate sense transcript expression in hen1-1 (Figure S16). In general, these observations support the notion that the increased antisense transcripts associated with miRNA targets are due to the loss of HEN1 function, presumably due to the loss of the 2-methylated hydroxyl group on the 3 end of smRNAs in the hen1-1 mutant [22]. (3) In sgs3-14, adjacent probes for MYB12 and TCP4 reported signals of widely differing amplitudes, where a few probes showed high signals (black arrows in Figures 5B, S6 and S14) and nearby probes recorded decreased signals relative to wild type (open arrows in Figures 5B, S6 and S14). The variable effects of sgs3-14 on transcript topology suggested a dynamic process affecting antisense transcript stability, which may also explain the complex expression pattern for the antisense transcripts with SCL6(IV) and TCP4 in dcl1-7 or hyl1-2 (Figures 3 and S14). We propose this phenomenon seen with the high resolution microarray is evidence of transitive mechanisms in action, e.g. rapid smRNA production by the cleavage of antisense and/or sense transcripts detected as fluctuating microarray signals.. . . Validation and Extension of Microarray Data by Semi-Quantitative Strand-Specific Reverse Transcription PCR. qRT-PCR was employed for select miRNA targets on the microarray as well as for other miRNA target genes. qRT-PCR primers were designed from 200 n.t. range 5 upstream and 3 downstream of the miRNA cleavage sites (Figure 7A) for AP2, APS1, CATION/H+ EXCHANGER 18 (ATCHX18/AT5G41610)(miR856 cleavage site), CUC2/AT5G53950, NAC1/AT1G56010 and a negative control gene VARIANT IN METHYLATION 1 (VIM1)/AT1G57820 previously shown not cleaved by miR164 [27]. The results of qRT-PCR for sense strands were generally consistent with previous [19] and our custom tiling microarray results (Figure S2). AP2 sense transcript expression was unchanged in hen1-1, hyl1-2 and sgs3-14, whereas it was decreased in dcl1-7 and rdr6-15 (Figure 7B right panel Downstream sense expression). Also in agreement with the microarray data was the finding that AP2 antisense transcripts were increased by 30% in hen1-1 mutants, and decreased in dcl1-7. We also examined the effect of a RNA silencing suppressor protein P1/HC-Pro from Turnip mosaic virus which binds to the miRNA/miRNA* duplex and probably inhibits the 3-terminal methylation of smRNAs [34]. We found that AP2 antisense transcripts were up-regulated in a P1/HC-Pro over-expressing line. A slightly higher expression was observed by qRT-PCR for antisense transcripts in the rdr6-15 mutant than by microarray analysis (compare Figure 6E with Figure 7B). APS1 sense transcripts were increased in all mutants, supporting the microarray results for hen1-1 and sgs3-14, but in contrast to those for dcl1-7, hyl1-2, and rdr6-15 (Figure S5). The differences observed might be due to sensitivity limitations (note the low signal to noise ratios for Figures 2-. . . 6 in some cases) or amplification differences inherent to the two methods. APS1 antisense transcripts were upregulated in hen1-1, down-regulated in dcl1-7 and hyl1-2, which was congruent with tiling array results. ATCHX18 is a member of putative Na+/H+ antiporter family targeted by miR856 and miR780. The expression level of the downstream sense region for the miR856 target site was increased in hen1-1, P1/HC-Pro lines, and rdr6-15, whereas corresponding upstream antisense transcripts were elevated in all mutants (Figure 7B). Interestingly, a natural antisense transcript (AT5G41612; TAIR Release 8) overlaps with ATCHX18 and might be queried in the qRT-PCR assay, despite the primers being over 1 kb distal to the annotated natural antisense transcript. CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 2 (CUC2) and NAC1 are members of NAC domain-containing transcription factors and are validated targets of miR164. qRT-PCR data showed that CUC2 sense transcripts were up-regulated in all mutants, whereas the levels of its antisense transcripts were unchanged in most mutants except for a decrease in hen1-1. NAC1 had more sense transcript expression in hen1-1 and hyl1-2 and less expression in rdr6-15. For NAC1 antisense transcripts, expression was elevated in hen1-1 and dcl1-7, but decreased in rdr6-15 (Figure 7B). VIM1 encodes a SRA (SET- and RING-associated) domain methylcytosine-binding protein, and it has been shown to have a cryptic miR164 binding site that fails to generate a cleavage product as probed by 5-RACE [27]. Thus, it was selected as a reference control for the qRT-PCR assays. VIM1 locus clearly showed some altered sense transcripts in the smRNA pathway mutants, however, as hypothesized, no antisense transcripts were detected under experimental conditions (Figure 7B).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g007. Figure 7. . qRT-PCR for sense and antisense expression of selected miRNA targets.. (A) Cartoon showing experimental design. For each selected miRNA target, two pairs of primers are designed, one pair located upstream of the miRNA cleavage site (dashed vertical line) labeled as FP1 and RP1 (forward primer1 and reverse primer1), and another pair located downstream of the miRNA cleavage site labeled as FP2 and RP2 (forward primer2 and reverse primer2). Regions queried (upstream or downstream) are defined according to their positions relative to the miRNA cleavage site. Approximate scale of average-sized PCR products (100 b.p.) is indicated.

On the right panel Downstream Sense Expression, the primer RP2 was used in the reverse transcription and primers FP2+RP2 were used in the following PCR reaction. On the left panel Upstream antisense expression, the primer FP1 was used in the reverse transcription and primers FP1+RP1 were used in the following PCR reaction.

Each panel is a representation of at least three independent replicates from each of two biological samples that gave similar results. Asterisk (*) in the panel for CHX18 denotes the region upstream or downstream of the miR856 cleavage site on CHX18 mRNA.. . . . In order to test the functional significance of MIR164 expression on transcripts of CUC2 and NAC1, their sense and antisense transcript levels were assayed in mir164a-4, mir164b-1, mir164c-2 single mutants and mir164a-4 b-1 c-1 triple knockout mutants [35]. As expected, CUC2 sense transcripts accumulated in the mir164a-4 and mir164c-2 mutants (Figure 8 right panel), but the antisense transcripts of CUC2 were unchanged in these knockout mutants except for a slight decrease in the mir164c-2 mutant (Figure 8 left panel). NAC1 sense transcript levels were elevated in all the knockout mutants and its antisense transcripts also increased in mir164a-4, mir164c-2 and mir164a-4 b-1 c-1 mutants (Figure 8). These results suggest that miR164 is probably not a primer for the observed antisense transcription, as previously speculated based on the function of HEN1 as a methyltransferase [36]. Northern blot for miR164 expression from inflorescence samples of these mutants showed that even in mir164a-4 b-1 c-1 triple mutants, miR164 expression was not completely abolished with 20% detectable expression level comparing to that of wild type [35]. The expression of a distinct miR164 species of 24-n.t. in length was generally unchanged in all these mir164 single and triple mutants [35]. These results imply that there should be more direct determinants regulating the abundance of miRNA target-associated antisense transcripts other than miRNAs themselves.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g008. Figure 8. . qRT-PCR for selected miRNA targets in different mir164 knockout mutants.. .

[35]. See Figure 7 for details of legends.. . . . . . MiRNA Targets and MIRNA Genes Are Hot Spots for Generating smRNAs. The availability of deep sequencing datasets for smRNAs [20],[28],[37],[38] affords the means to correlate antisense transcript abundances with their presumptive DCL products and gain insight into the causal relationships of antisense transcripts and smRNAs. We mined the unique smRNAs having only one locus in the A. thaliana genome that matched perfectly to the sense or antisense strand of test sets of miRNA-associated genes (Table S8). Figure 9 shows the average number smRNAs of different size classes normalized for gene length in validated or predicted miRNA targets, paralogous non-targets, and MIRNA genes. In the categories of 20-22 n.t. smRNAs, validated miRNA targets had significantly more smRNAs matching to the sense strand compared to paralogs (Figure 9A, P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model), especially in the size class of 21 n.t. Predicted miRNA targets also generated abundant smRNAs, in which 20, 22, 23, and 24 n.t. groups gave higher numbers of smRNAs from the sense strand when compared with validated miRNA target genes. The 21 n.t. predicted target-originated sense smRNAs were significantly more abundant than those from paralogs (Figure 9A). For reference, the number of sense strand smRNAs generated from 187 miRNA hairpins (miRBase, microrna.sanger.ac.uk) was also calculated. MiRNA hairpins produced predominantly 20-22 n.t. smRNAs, which is well known as due to the processing of miRNA hairpin precursors to generate mature miRNAs and miRNA* by DCL1 and/or DCL4 [28]. MiRNA hairpins also produced 23-24 n.t. and longer smRNAs, consistent with a report on functional 23 to 25 n.t.-long miRNAs generated by DCL3 [39], indicating the overlapping functions of different DCLs on the processing of miRNA hairpin precursors. The antisense strand of miRNA targets produced smRNAs to a similar extent as those from the sense strand compared to paralogs (Figure 9B). Validated miRNA targets had significantly more 20-22 n.t. smRNAs than paralogs (P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model). The 21 n.t. sense and antisense smRNAs were the main class of smRNAs generated from validated and predicted miRNA targets, suggesting they are mechanistically linked to the RNA silencing pathway through DCL1. Remarkably, MIRNA hairpins generated antisense smRNAs as well, in which 21 n.t. antisense smRNA were also the major class (Figure 9B). Table 2 summarizes the known cases of miRNA targets and their MIRNA genes that generated antisense smRNAs, ranked according to abundances of antisense smRNAs and grouped into MIRNA gene families. It is interesting that several of the transitive MIRNA genes correlate with top-ranking miRNA targets, for example ATCHX18 and MIR780, AGO1 and MIR168a, SCL family and MIR171c, SAMT and MIR163, AP2 and TOE2 with MIR172, and the SPL family with MIR156 (Table 2). Careful analysis of the location for these sense and antisense smRNAs on the miRNA hairpins showed that about 30% of unique sense smRNAs overlap with mature miRNA sites, whereas another 28% overlap with the miRNA* sites by at least 16 n.t. (Figure S17). For the unique antisense smRNAs on the miRNA hairpins, about 14% overlap with the locus of the mature miRNA on the sense strand, whereas 27% of them overlap with the miRNA* sites Interestingly, several antisense 24 n.t. smRNAs were found to be in phase with the middle of the mature miR783 or miR854b* site on their individual hairpins (Figure S18). We propose this is evidence for the miRNA hairpin processing via the RNA silencing pathway in which the miRNA* or miRNA may be programmed into a RISC that triggers cleavage [29] and/or antisense transcription and subsequent dicing on their primary transcripts, in these cases presumably by DCL3.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g009. Figure 9. . Normalized abundance of unique smRNAs from multiple deep sequencing datasets with perfect matches to miRNA-associated gene sets..

(B) Number of unique smRNAs mapping to the antisense strand of validated and predicted miRNA targets, paralogous non-targets and MIRNA hairpins. smRNA sequences were obtained from published data [20],[28],[37],[38] and miRNA hairpin sequences were queried from the miRBase database (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/) [76].

The number of antisense smRNAs with perfect matches to the cDNA for each validated miRNA target and each miRNA hairpin was scored and then divided by the length of each gene or hairpin individually (antisense smRNA number/kb). TAS genes targeted by miR173, miR390, and miR828 were excluded from this analysis.. . . . We further investigated the topology of antisense transcription manifested in smRNAs by plotting the abundance of unique smRNAs (extracted from the MPSS Plus database) as a function of the distance between the smRNA loci and the miRNA target sites for validated miRNA targets, predicted targets and paralogous non-targets (Figure 10). Validated targets had sense and antisense smRNAs clustered around 1000 n.t. upstream and downstream of the miRNA cleavage sites, with a few cases of hits >2000 n.t. upstream and 3000 n.t. downstream of the cleavage sites (Figure 10A). The numbers of sense: antisense smRNA signatures associated with validated targets were about the same (70: 62; Table S9). However, the topology of these smRNA signatures showed that the numbers of sense and antisense smRNA signatures downstream of miRNA cleavage sites were greater than those upstream (22 up: 48 down and 7 up: 55 down for sense and antisense smRNA signatures, respectively; Table S9 and Figure 10A inset). Antisense smRNAs were significantly more abundant than the sense smRNA signatures even when the two most abundant antisense smRNA signatures were removed (transcripts per quarter million=416 and 192 corresponding to NF-YA8/AT1G17590 [miR169 target]; ATHB15/AT1G52150 [miR166 target], respectively; P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model). This same phenomenon was observed in predicted miRNA targets as well, with significantly higher abundances for antisense smRNA signatures than sense smRNA ones (P<0.05, one-sided Student's t-test, equal variance model; Table S9, Figure 10B). There were also more antisense smRNA signatures located downstream of the predicted miRNA cleavage sites than upstream antisense ones (50 up: 113 down, respectively). Paralog genes showed no significant correlation (Table S9, Figure 10C). These results indicate that generally more smRNA signatures were generated towards the 3 end of miRNA target transcripts, presumably from the downstream region of the miRNA cleavage sites on the antisense strand. These data fit with the observation that uncapped transcripts are more susceptible to RNA silencing pathways, which lead to the production of sense and antisense smRNAs [33].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000457.g010. Figure 10. . Abundance and positions of unique MPSS smRNA signatures with perfect matches to miRNA targets and paralogous non-targets..

MPSS smRNA signatures were obtained from the MPSS Plus Database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at) and searched against A. thaliana cDNA sequences to find the unique matches by BLAST (see Material and Methods for details). The abundance of unique signatures (transcripts per quarter million) is plotted as a function of the position of signatures relative to the miRNA target sites for validated and predicted miRNA targets, or to pseudo binding sites for paralogous non-targets. Sense smRNAs are plotted on the positive-valued ordinate of each panel, while antisense smRNAs are on the negative-valued ordinate. The inset in panel A shows expanded ordinate scale for the distribution of smRNAs spanning 1,000 n.t. upstream and downstream of miRNA cleavage sites for validated targets..
PMC5132069	Results. . Opposite effects of DNA methylation and DNA demethylation on basal resistance to Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. . To determine impacts of DNA (de)methylation on resistance against biotrophic pathogens, we evaluated a range of Arabidopsis mutants in DNA (de)methylation mechanisms for basal resistance to the obligate biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). To prevent pleiotropic effects of developmental phenotypes, we only selected mutants with normal (wild-type) growth phenotypes under the conditions of our patho-assays (Figure1a). T-DNA insertions in ros1 (SALK_135293), ros3 (SALK_022363C) and cmt3 (SALK_148381) were confirmed by PCR of genomic DNA (FigureS1a), while transcriptional knock-down of ROS1 and NRPE1 gene expression was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis in ros1 and nrpe1, respectively (FigureS1b). Three-week-old seedlings were spray-inoculated with Hpa conidiospores and collected 6days later for trypan blue staining. Microscopic examination of Hpa colonization revealed that two mutants defective in RdDM, nrpe1 (Pontier etal., 2005) and drd1 (Kanno etal., 2004), showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of leaves producing conidiospores and oospores (class III and IV; Figure1b). The cmt3 mutant, which is defective in maintenance of CHG methylation (Lindroth etal., 2001), also showed enhanced resistance in comparison to Col-0, although to a lesser extent than nrpe1 and drd1 (Figure1b). The ddm1 mutant, which is affected DNA methylation at all sequence contexts in intergenic regions (Vongs etal., 1993; Jeddeloh etal., 1998; Zemach etal., 2013), was tested in the fourth generation of homozygosity and showed the strongest level of resistance amongst all genotypes tested (Figure1b). In contrast to the hypo-methylated mutants, the DNA glycosylase mutant ros1, which is hyper-methylated at all DNA sequence contexts (Gong etal., 2002; Zhu etal., 2007), was significantly more susceptible to Hpa than Col-0 plants (Figure1b). This enhanced susceptibility was similar to that of SA-insensitive npr1 plants (Cao etal., 1994; FigureS2a). The ros3 mutant, which is affected in an RNA-binding protein that interacts with ROS1 (Zheng etal., 2008), also showed enhanced susceptibility to Hpa (Figure1b), although this phenotype was not consistent over multiple experiments (FigureS2a). Conversely, all other mutants tested showed similar resistance phenotypes between independent experiments (FigureS2a). Together, these results point to opposite roles of DNA methylation and DNA demethylation in basal resistance to Hpa. Subsequent experiments focused on the hypo-methylated nrpe1 mutant and hyper-methylated ros1 mutant, whose Hpa resistance phenotypes were confirmed by qPCR quantification of oomycete biomass (FigureS2b).. . Figure 1. . Basal resistance to Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that are affected in DNA (de)methylation.. (a) Growth phenotypes of tested Arabidopsis genotypes before infection. Genotypes correspond to those of the bars in (b) below each picture.. (b) Levels of basal resistance to H.arabidopsidis (Hpa) in DNA methylation mutants (ddm1 F4, nrpe1, drd1, and cmt3) and DNA demethylation mutants (ros3 and ros1). Six days after spray inoculation of 3-week-old plants (105 conidiospores ml-1), 200 leaves from 35 plants per genotype were microscopically assigned to different Hpa colonization classes following trypan blue staining. Shown are relative numbers of leaves assigned to different colonization classes. Inserts show representative levels of classes. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in class distributions compared to Col-0 (chi2 test; P<0.05).. . . . . . DNA methylation regulates effectiveness of callose deposition and SA-dependent PR1 gene induction upon Hpa infection. Reinforcement of the cell wall by deposition of callose-rich papillae contributes to slowing down pathogen colonization at relatively early stages of infection (Luna etal., 2011; Ellinger etal., 2013; Voigt, 2014). To determine the role of DNA (de)methylation in this induced defence layer against Hpa, we compared the effectiveness of callose deposition in relation to Hpa colonization between the wild-type Col-0, hypo-methylated nrpe1, and hyper-methylated ros1. To this end, leaves were collected at 48h post inoculation (hpi) for calcofluor/analine blue double staining and analysed by epifluorescence microscopy. To assess the defence-contributing activity of callose, all germinating spores were assigned to two mutually exclusive classes: (i) spores that were effectively arrested by callose and (ii) spores that were not arrested by callose. Using this classification, the ros1 mutant showed a statistically significant reduction in callose effectiveness in comparison to Col-0 plants (chi2; P<0.001; Figure2a). This indicates that the enhanced DNA methylation in this mutant represses the effectiveness of callose deposition.. . Figure 2. . Effectiveness and responsiveness of inducible defences against H.arabidopsidis in nrpe1, ros1 and Col-0.. (a) Effectiveness of callose deposition against Hpa infection at 48h after inoculation of 3-week-old plants (105 conidiospores ml-1). Defence phenotypes were determined by epifluorescence microscopy in at least 10 leaves per genotype, and assigned to two different classes based on presence or absence of successful penetration into the mesophyll by Hpa. Inserts on the right show an example of each class. Germinating Hpa spores appear in blue (calcofluor white-stained) and callose deposition is indicated by the presence of yellow staining (analine blue-stained). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in class distributions compared to Col-0 (chi2 test; P<0.05). Scale bars=100mum.. (b) RT-qPCR quantification of PR1 gene expression in Col-0, nrpe1 and ros1 at 48 and 72h after inoculation with Hpa or mock treatment. Data represent mean values of relative expression (SEM) from four biologically replicated samples. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in comparison to Col-0 (Student's t-test; P<0.05).. . . . In addition to cell wall defence, resistance to Hpa relies on post-invasive SA-dependent defences (Lawton etal., 1995; Thomma etal., 1998; Ton etal., 2002). To examine whether DNA (de)methylation affects SA-dependent defences, we quantified relative transcript accumulation of the SA-inducible PR1 marker gene at 48 and 72hpi with Hpa, using RT-qPCR (Figure2b). Consistent with previous results (Lpez etal., 2011), the more resistant nrpe1 mutant displayed a stronger induction of the PR1 gene, which was statistically significant at 48hpi with Hpa (P=0.026). Conversely, the more susceptible ros1 mutant showed repressed PR1 induction at 48hpi compared to Col-0 (P=0.028). As the nrpe1 mutant does not show constitutive expression of PR1 gene, we conclude that the DNA hypo-methylation in nrpe1 primes SA-dependent defence against Hpa, whereas DNA hyper-methylation in ros1 represses this type of defence.. . . Role of NRPE1- and ROS1-dependent DNA methylation in basal resistance against necrotrophic fungi. Lpez etal. (2011) demonstrated that mutants in RdDM display enhanced susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina, which is associated with repressed responsiveness of JA-dependent defence genes. To examine whether the increased level of DNA methylation in ros1 has an opposite effect on basal resistance to necrotrophic fungi, we compared 4.5-week Col-0, nrpe1 and ros1 for basal resistance against the Ascomycete fungus P.cucumerina. Basal resistance was quantified by necrotic lesion diameter, which is a reliable parameter to assess necrotrophic colonization by this fungus after droplet inoculation (Ton and Mauch-Mani, 2004; Ptriacq etal., 2016). At 6days post inoculation, the nrpe1 mutant developed larger lesions than Col-0 (Figures3a and S3a), confirming previous results by Lpez etal. (2011). Conversely, ros1 plants displayed significantly smaller necrotic lesions than Col-0 (Figures3a and S3a), indicating enhanced basal resistance to P.cucumerina. The disease phenotypes of nrpe1 and ros1 were validated by qPCR quantification of fungal DNA (FigureS3b), confirming that both mutants are oppositely affected in disease resistance to P.cucumerina. Furthermore, similar results were obtained by quantifying microscopic colonization by a different necrotrophic fungus, A.brassicicola (FigureS3c). It can thus be concluded that DNA hyper-methylation in the ros1 mutant boosts basal disease resistance to necrotrophic fungi.. . Figure 3. . Basal resistance to Plectosphaerella cucumerina and JA-induced gene expression in nrpe1, ros1 and Col-0.. (a) Levels of basal resistance to P.cucumerina. Shown are mean lesion diameters (SEM; 27 plants) at 6days after droplet inoculation of 4.5-week-old plants. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between Col-0 and mutant plants (Student's t-test; P<0.05).. (b) RT-qPCR quantification of PDF1.2 and VSP2 gene expression in Col-0, nrpe1 and ros1 at 0, 4, 8 and 24h after spraying with 0.1mm jasmonic acid (JA). Data represent mean values of relative expression (SEM; n=3). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in comparison to Col-0 samples (Student's t-test; P<0.05).. . . . Basal resistance against P.cucumerina and A.brassicicola partially relies on JA-dependent defences (Thomma etal., 1998, 1999; Ton and Mauch-Mani, 2004). To investigate whether the enhanced resistance of ros1 is based on increased sensitivity of JA-inducible defence gene expression, we analysed plants for PDF1.2 and VSP2 expression at 0, 4, 8 and 24h after spraying of the leaves with 50mm JA. Consistent with the earlier notion that mutations in RdDM repress defence gene responsiveness to JA (Lpez etal., 2011), the nrpe1 mutant showed significantly lower and/or delayed JA induction of both genes in comparison to wild-type plants (Figure3b). Surprisingly, despite the fact that the ros1 mutant was more resistant to both P.cucumerina and A.brassicicola (Figures3a and S3), it also showed repressed induction of PDF1.2 and VSP2 by JA, which was statistically significant at 4h post treatment with JA (Figure3b). Thus, increased resistance of ros1 to necrotrophic fungi is not based on primed responsiveness of JA-inducible gene expression.. . . ROS1-dependent demethylation does not play a role in within-generation SAR, but is required for TAR. Systemic acquired resistance is a pathogen-inducible form of acquired immunity that is expressed systemically (Durrant and Dong, 2004). Recently, it was shown that pathogen-induced acquired immunity can be transmitted to following generations in Arabidopsis (TAR; Slaughter etal., 2012; Luna etal., 2012). This resistance could be mimicked by genetic mutations in the DNA methylation machinery (Luna and Ton, 2012; Luna etal., 2012), suggesting that DNA demethylation is responsible for the generation and/or transmission of the response. To investigate the role of NRPE1- and ROS1-dependent DNA (de)methylation during within-generation SAR, three lower leaves of 4.5-week-old plants were infiltrated with avirulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 carrying the avirulence gene avrRpm1 (Pst avrRpm1). Three days after SAR induction, systemic leaves were challenged with Hpa. As expected, SAR-treated Col-0 plants displayed a statistically significant reduction in Hpa colonization compared to control-treated plants (Figure4a). SAR in Pst avrRpm1-infected nrpe1 plants was borderline statistically significant (P=0.072), probably due to the masking effect of this mutant's elevated basal resistance (Figure1a). Notably, the ros1 mutant was fully capable of mounting a statistically significant SAR response against Hpa infection, indicating that ROS1-dependent DNA demethylation does not play a role in within-generation SAR.. . Figure 4. . Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and transgenerational acquired resistance (TAR) in Col-0, nrpe1 and ros1.. (a) Quantification of within-generation SAR against Hpa. Four leaves of 4.5-week-old plants were infiltrated with either avirulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 avrRpm1 (Pst avrRpm1) or 10mm MgSO4 (mock). Three days after SAR induction, plants were spray inoculated with Hpa (105conidiosporesml-1). At 6days after inoculation, 4-6 leaves from 15 plants per genotype were stained with trypan blue and microscopically assigned to different Hpa colonization classes (right panels). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in class distributions between SAR- and mock-treated plants (chi2 test; P<0.05).. (b) Quantification of TAR against Hpa in P1 and C1 progenies from Pst DC3000- and mock-inoculated plants, respectively. Parental plants were spray-inoculated three consecutive times at 3-4day intervals with Pst DC3000 or 10mm MgSO4 (mock), and allowed to set seed. Leaves of 3-week-old progenies were inoculated with Hpa (105conidiospores ml-1) and examined for pathogen colonization 6days later, as detailed in the legend of Figure1(a). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in class distributions between P1 and C1 progenies (chi2 test; P<0.05).. . . . We then investigated the role of NRPE1- and ROS1-dependent DNA (de)methylation in TAR. To this end, Col-0, nrpe1 and ros1 were inoculated three times with increasing doses of virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) and allowed to set seed. Three-week-old F1 seedlings from Pst DC3000- (P1) and mock-treated (C1) parent plants were tested for resistance against Hpa (Figure4b). P1 progeny from Pst DC3000-infected Col-0 showed increased basal resistance in comparison to C1 progeny from mock-treated Col-0 (P=0.017). By contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in Hpa resistance between P1 and C1 progenies of nrpe1 (P=0.538). Levels of resistance in C1 progeny from nrpe1 were statistically similar to that of P1 progeny from Col-0 (P=0.148), which is consistent with the notion that reduced DNA methylation mimics TAR (Luna and Ton, 2012; Luna etal., 2012). Like the nrpe1 mutant, P1 and C1 progenies from ros1 did not show a difference in Hpa resistance (P=0.697). However, C1 progeny from ros1 displayed enhanced susceptibility in comparison to both P1 and C1 progeny of Col-0 (P<0.001), indicating that the lack of TAR in ros1 is due to this mutant's inability to transmit and/or express transgenerational acquired immunity.. . . NRPE1- and ROS1-dependent DNA (de-)methylation influences nearly half of the pathogenesis-related transcriptome. DNA methylation patterns are known to affect gene expression (Law and Jacobsen, 2010). Since nrpe1 and ros1 are antagonistically affected in both DNA methylation and responsiveness of PR1 expression during Hpa infection (Figure2b), we further explored global impacts of both mutations on the pathogenesis-related transcriptome of Hpa-infected Arabidopsis, using Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST arrays. To account for transcriptomic responses during expression of penetration defence (48hpi) and post-invasive defence during hyphal colonization (72hpi), we isolated RNA from Col-0, nrpe1 and ros1 at 48 and 72hpi, respectively. First, we assessed the global impacts of mutations in NRPE1 and ROS1 by determining the number of differentially expressed genes between each mutant and Col-0 at any time-point and condition (q0.01). This analysis revealed that 1975 and 1150 genes are differentially expressed in the ros1 and nrpe1, respectively. By comparing these gene sets with the 967 genes that are differentially expressed in Col-0 between mock and Hpa-inoculated leaf samples (i.e. the Hpa-responsive genes), we found that 49% of all Hpa-responsive genes are affected by mutations in NRPE1 and/or ROS1 (477/967=49%; Figure5a). Hence, nearly half of the pathogenesis-related transcriptome of Arabidopsis is controlled directly or indirectly by NRPE1- and ROS1-dependent DNA (de)methylation.. . Figure 5. . The pathogenesis-related transcriptome of Col-0, nrpe1 and ros1 during infection by H.arabidopsidis.. (a) Venn diagram showing numbers of differentially expressed genes at 48 and/or 72h post inoculation (hpi) between mock- (m) and Hpa-inoculated (h) Col-0 (Hpa; green), between Col-0 and nrpe1 for any time-point and condition (nrpe1; blue), and between Col-0 and ros1 for any time-point and any condition (ros1; red). Each time-point (48 and 72hpi) was analysed separately; numbers represent the sum of differentially expressed genes at one or both time-points. Genes were considered to be differentially expressed at LIMMA-reported q-value 0.01 (global adjust, FDR).. (b) Hpa-inducible genes that show augmented induction in nrpe1 and/or repressed induction in ros1 are enriched with gene ontology (GO) terms Systemic Acquired Resistance (GO: 0009627) and Salicylic Acid Biosynthetic Process (GO: 0009697).. (c) Transcript levels of all 166 Hpa-inducible genes with augmented induction in nrpe1 and/or repressed induction in ros1. Genes were selected when differentially expressed between ros1 and nrpe1, as well as between Col-0 and ros1, and/or between Col-0 and nrpe1, at either time-point after inoculation. Heat map projections represent z-scores of transcript levels.. . . . . . Defence-related genes that are primed by DNA hypo-methylation and/or repressed by DNA hyper-methylation are strongly enriched with SA-dependent defence genes. The resistance phenotypes of nrpe1 and ros1 to Hpa can be caused by constant changes in defence gene expression, changes in defence gene responsiveness to pathogen attack, or a combination of both. Comparison of mock-inoculated nrpe1 and ros1 relative to Col-0 identified 1215 genes with enhanced expression in nrpe1 and/or repressed expression in ros1 at 48 and/or 72hpi (Figure5b). Of these, 256 genes were also Hpa-inducible in Col-0 plants (Figure5b). We then searched for defence-related genes with increased Hpa responsiveness in the more resistant nrpe1 mutant (i.e. primed) and/or repressed responsiveness in the more susceptible ros1 mutant. To this end, the group of 700 Hpa-inducible genes (shown in green; Figure5b) were filtered: (i) for a statistically significant difference between Hpa-inoculated nrpe1 and ros1 (48 and/or 72hpi; q0.01); and (ii) for a statistically significant difference between at least one of the Hpa-inoculated mutants and Hpa-inoculated Col-0 (48 and/or 72hpi; q0.01). As evidenced by a heat map projection of the gene expression profiles (Figures5c and S4), this filter identified 166 defence-related genes with primed Hpa responsiveness in nrpe1 and/or repressed Hpa responsiveness in ros1 (DataS1). Of these 166 genes, 46 were altered in Hpa responsiveness only, whereas 120 showed a combination of differential expression between mock-treated plants and differential responsiveness to Hpa (Figure5b). Interestingly, in comparison to all other gene sets, the genes displaying differential Hpa responsiveness showed the highest proportion of gene ontology (GO) terms Systemic Acquired Resistance and Salicylic Acid Biosynthetic Process (Figure5b). This outcome supports our notion that the resistance phenotypes of nrpe1 and ros1 are predominantly based on changes in defence gene responsiveness, rather than changes in constitutive gene expression.. . . The majority of ROS1- and/or NRPE1-controlled defence genes is not associated with ROS1- and/or NRPE1-dependent DNA methylation in their promoter regions. In subsequent analyses, we focused on the selection of 166 defence-related genes that are primed by DNA hypo-methylation and/or repressed by DNA hyper-methylation. First, we determined reproducibility of these microarray results by profiling transcript accumulation of four randomly selected genes in an independent experiment, using RT-qPCR. As is shown in FigureS5, all four genes showed reproducible expression profiles to the microarray experiment. Next, we examined whether the selection of 166 defence-related genes are regulated directly (in cis) or indirectly (in trans) by NRPE1 and ROS1-dependent DNA (de-)methylation. Because NRPE1 and ROS1 are known to control DNA methylation at or around transposable elements (TEs; Law and Jacobsen, 2010), we investigated whether the selection of 166 genes are enriched with nearby TEs. Using the TAIR10 annotation for known TEs, the 166 genes showed a weak enrichment of TEs within 2kb upstream of their transcriptional start, relative to a background of all other Arabidopsis genes on the microarray (Figure6a). By contrast, no TE enrichment was found for genic or 2kb-downstream regions of the 166 genes (Figure6a). We then examined whether the TE-enriched promoter regions are subject to NRPE1- or ROS1-dependent DNA (de-)methylation. To this end, we used publically available C-methylomes of nrpe1 and ros1 (Qian etal., 2012; Stroud etal., 2013) to create a combined C-methylome of sufficient sequence coverage (5 reads, 8363349 positions), before determining which of these positions are hypo-methylated in nrpe1 and/or hyper-methylated in ros1. From this list, we selected genes with at least three differentially methylated cytosines at the same context (CG, CHG or CHH) within their 2kb promoter region. Although the promoters of 166 defence-related genes were marginally enriched for NRPE1-dependent CHG and/or CHH methylation (Figure6b), this enrichment was not statistically significant in comparison to all other genes on the microarray (chi2 tests; P=0.3150 and 0.2837, respectively). Furthermore, the 166 gene promoters were not enriched for ROS1-dependent hypo-methylation. Together, this indicates that the majority of 166 defence genes are indirectly (trans-)regulated by NRPE1- and/or ROS1-dependent DNA (de)methylation.. . Figure 6. . Transposable element (TE) occurrence and DNA methylation features in 166 defence genes whose responsiveness is primed in nrpe1 and/or repressed in ros1.. (a) Relative TE occurrence in the selection of 166 genes compared to other genes considered in the transcriptome analysis (genes on array). For the 2kb upstream regions (5; relative to transcriptional start site) and the 2kb downstream regions (3; relative to poly-adenylation site), 100 windows of 20bp were used; for gene body regions, 100 windows of 1% of the gene length were used.. (b) Relative occurrence of differentially methylated cytosines (DmCs) in 2kb gene promoter regions of nrpe1 and ros1. Dark shades: DmC frequencies within the selection of 166 Hpa-responsive genes with augmented induction in nrpe1 and/or repressed induction in ros1 during Hpa infection. Light shades: DmC frequencies in all other genes considered in the transcriptome analysis. Shown are promoters with at least three differentially methylated DmCs in nrpe1 or ros1, relative to Col-0. Results are based on publically available bisulfite sequencing data of nrpe1 and ros1 (Qian etal., 2012; Stroud etal., 2013).. (c) Venn diagram representing a selection of the 166 gene promoters (2kb) that contain one or more TEs (green), have at least three hyper-methylated cytosines in the ros1 mutant (blue), and have at least three hypo-methylated cytosines in the nrpe1 mutant (red).. . . . . . Selection of 25 defence regulatory genes that are cis-regulated by NRPE1- and/or ROS1-dependent DNA (de-)methylation. To search for defence regulatory genes that are cis-regulated by NRPE1-/ROS1-dependent DNA (de)methylation, we analysed the 2kb gene promoter regions from the 166 NRPE1-/ROS1-controlled defence genes for: (i) TE presence; and (ii) occurrence of more than three hypo-methylated cytosines in nrpe1 and/or hyper-methylated cytosines in ros1. A total of 25 gene promoters met these criteria (Figure6c). To illustrate the DNA (de)methylation activities in these promoters, FigureS6 plots the positions of TEs and differentially methylated cytosines in nrpe1 and ros1. Furthermore, using data from a recent ChIP-sequencing study with a polyclonal antibody against native NRPE1 protein (Zhong etal., 2015), we show that physical binding of NRPE1 largely coincides with hypo-methylated regions in the nrpe1 mutant, thereby confirming localised activity by the Pol V complex. The group of 25 cis-regulated genes includes genes with annotated defence regulatory activity, such as genes encoding for pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leucine-rich repeat (LRR) resistance proteins, CYP81D1 and DOWNY MILDEW RESISTANT 6 (TableS1), each of which has the potential to control a larger set of defence genes..
PMC2885407	Results. . Variation in the shoot ionome of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. The concentration of various elements in healthy A. thaliana shoot tissue from Col-0 varies over 4 orders of magnitude depending on the element and its biological function (Table 1). Macronutrients such as Mg, P, K and Ca accumulate more than 9,500 g g-1 of the shoot dry weight, whereas micronutrients such as B, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Mo range in concentration from 1-100 g g-1. Non-essential, potentially toxic trace elements such as As, Se, and Cd can accumulate to between 1-10 g g-1 without any visible symptoms of toxicity. An ANOVA analysis of the accumulation in the 12 accessions reveals that variation in 13 of the 17 elements measured are under genetic control within the population (Table 1, Table 2, Table S1A). Several elements showed large variation between the lowest and highest accumulating accessions (Table 2). Mo showed the most variation with 44 significant pairwise differences between accessions (Table S1). Since Col-0 is the reference accession and a parent of many of the available RIL populations, we have also included a table of elemental differences compared with Col-0 (Table 2).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011081.t001.

Variation in the seed ionome of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. The concentration of elements measured in A. thaliana seed varies over 4 orders of magnitude, a similar scale to that observed in shoots (Table 1). However, there are several significant differences between the shoot and seed ionome, with certain elements being enriched or reduced relative to other elements. For example, on a g g-1 dry weight basis, P does not change concentrations from seed to shoot, but K is approximately 4-fold lower in the seeds (Table 1). Furthermore, ANOVA analysis of the elemental composition of seeds from different A. thaliana accessions showed significant genetic control for 8 of the 17 elements (Table 1, Table 3, Table S1). Several significant differences between accessions in the seed mirror the differences observed between the accessions in the leaves, however, there are multiple comparisons in which significant differences in the leaves are not reflected in the seed (and vice versa). For example, the elevated shoot Na observed in Ts-1 is also reflected in the seed, with Ts-1 showing a 161% increase in seed Na compared to Col-0 (Table 2 and 3), while the other high shoot Na accession, Tsu-1 does not accumulate significantly different amounts of Na in its seeds compared to Col-0 (Table 3).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011081.t003.

Identification of QTLs controlling ionomic differences in three Recombinant Inbred Populations. To expand on the genetic characterization of the ionome, we analyzed the elemental composition of 3 RIL populations: Bay-0  Shadahara (BaySha), Col-4  Ler-0 (ColLer) and Cvi-0  Ler-2 (CviLer). BaySha and CviLer were grown in two different environments (two growth media with differing ingredients) for a total of 5 different experiments. The experiments differed in the number of RIL lines analyzed (from 93 for ColLer to 411 for the second BaySha experiment) and the number of plants analyzed per line (1-3). The parents of the RIL population showed significant differences in 53 out of the possible 87 instances (17 elements5 populations+S and Rb measured in the second BaySha experiment). We identified 218 QTLs in the five experiments although a significant number are likely the same QTL found in two experiments of the same population or are due to the shared Ler parent of CviLer and ColLer populations (Tables 4 and 5, Table S2). 158 of the 218 QTLs (72%) were found for elements for which the parents had a significant difference, for an average of 3.0 QTLs/element while elements in which the parents were not significantly different averaged 1.8 QTLs (Tables 4 and 5). All of the 19 major (r2>20%) QTLs we identified came from elements in which the parents were significantly different (Tables 4 and 5, Table S2). Frequency distributions showing difference between parental lines are provided in supplemental Files S1, S2, S3, S4, S5. To evaluate the effect of different experimental designs on the ability to identify QTLs for ionomic traits, we created subsets of the large BaySha experiment (411 lines at n=2, 800 samples) and the large CviLer experiment (165 lines at n=3). Randomly generated n=1 and n=2 subsets of the CviLer data identified 69% and 95% as many QTLs respectively as the n=3 data from which they were derived. When data from the 165 lines used in the small BaySha experiment was extracted from the large BaySha 411 line experiment, 20% fewer QTLs were identified, suggesting that the different numbers of QTLs identified between the large and small BaySha experiments is due to the change in the number of lines.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011081.t004.

Transgressive Segregation and Epistasis. We tested for transgressive segregation using two independent methods: the number of RILs which were significantly higher or lower than the parents grown in the same trays or having two QTLs with opposite allelic effects. For elements in which there was not a significant difference between the parents, the percentage of RILs that fell outside the range of the parents ranged from 10%-41% (Tables 4 and 5, Files S1, S2, S3, S4, S5). The likelihood of finding transgressive segregation by the opposite allelic effects test increased as the number of QTLs increased: transgressive segregation occurred in 14 of 19 elements in the large (411 line) BaySha experiment (83 QTLs), none of the elements in the ColLer experiment (11 QTLs) and only two of the elements in the first CviLer experiment (28 QTLs) (Tables 4 and 5). Epistatic interactions between the identified QTLs were examined using RQTL in the large BaySha population and the CviLer population experiments. Only five significant (p<0.01) interactions were found among the 53 (17+17+19) elements examined, none of which were found in the 411 line (large) BaySha population with the most power to detect epistatic interactions (Table S3).. . . Environmental Effect on Element Correlations and QTL Discovery. Alterations in the environment or physiology of a plant can affect the accumulation of multiple elements simultaneously. Variation in mineral uptake in different environments has been described in A. thaliana [19], [21], [23] and Silene vulgaris [24]. The clearest example of the effect of the environment was observed in the relationships between elements within a given experiment. We measured the correlation between each pairwise combination of elements from every RIL in each of the five populations (Figure 1). While many elements were significantly correlated within each of the five experiments, only three pairs of elements were correlated in every populationenvironment we analyzed: Li-Na, Mg-Ca, and Cu-Zn, although Li-As, Li-Cd, Li-K, Li-Zn, P-Fe, Mg-Zn and Zn-Cd were found in 4 of the 5 experiments (Figure 1).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011081.g001. Figure 1. . Elemental correlations for the 5 RIL populations.. Solid lines represent a positive correlation value. Dashed lines represent negative correlation values. Thicker solid and dashed lines indicate correlations >0.5 or <-0.5, respectively. ColLer, CviLer high Fe, and BaySha small were all grown in Fe-sufficient Sunshine growth medium. The other CviLer population was grown in Sunshine growth medium with low Fe watering, while the Large BaySha population was grown in Promix growth medium.. . . . The BaySha and CviLer populations were each grown in two different growth media environments. Most of the significant elemental correlations (68 of 85 total correlations in BaySha and 66 of 76 total correlations in CviLer) were found in only one of the environments (Figure 1). The Ca-Mo correlation was unique to the BaySha population and was found in both environments. There is a three element correlated network that only appears in Sunshine growth medium with sufficient Fe, Co-Cd is positively correlated while both are negatively correlated to Cu (Cu-Cd is not significant in CviLer) (Figure 1). Interestingly, in the BaySha Promix experiment, Co-Cu is also negatively correlated, but Cu-Cd is positively correlated. Eight other correlations were shared between the three populations grown in sufficient Fe Sunshine growth medium. In the Fe sufficient Sunshine growth medium, BaySha shared 18 and 22 correlations with CviLer and ColLer, respectively (Figure 1). When the Promix grown BaySha population was compared with sufficient Fe Sunshine CviLer and ColLer populations, only 8 and 11 shared correlations were identified (Figure 1).. . . Comparison of QTLs across environments. To test whether altering the environment altered which genetic loci control the ionome, we compared the QTLs identified for each element in the five experiments. The only common QTL among the five populations, regardless of environment, population size or genetic background, is the Mo QTL on chromosome two corresponding to the MOT1 locus [25]. In the analysis of the parents grown with the CviLer population, seven of the elements measured, Li, Na, Mg, P, Ca, Mo and Cd, were significantly different in both growth conditions, three were not significantly different in either condition, and seven elements were only significant in one condition (Tables 4 and 5, Table S2). For the elements that were significantly different in the parents in both conditions, 4 of the 7 QTLs were found in both conditions (Tables 4 and 5, Figure 2, Table S2). In the analysis of the parents grown with the BaySha populations, nine of the elements measured, Na, Mg, P, K, Ca, Ni, Zn, Mo and Cd, were significantly different in both growing conditions, two were not significantly different in either condition, and eight elements were significantly different in only one condition (Tables 4 and 5, Table S2). Of the nine elements in both BaySha populations that were significantly different in the parents, 20 of 54 QTLs were found in both growing conditions (Tables 4 and 5, Figure 2, Table S2).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0011081.g002.

Comparing QTLs from the ColLer and CviLer populations grown in sufficient Fe Sunshine growth medium, we identified four common QTLs (Figure 2, Table S2). However, only one of those QTL (Mo) was shared with the BaySha population grown in the same medium. When comparing the BaySha populations with ColLer, three of the 11 ColLer QTLs appear to be in similar locations (Figure 2, Table S2). The CviLer populations grown in different environments share four common QTLs (Figure 2) and the BaySha populations share 25 QTLs (Figure 2, Table S2)..
PMC2790454	Results. In this paper, immunofluorescent labeling and confocal microscopic observation revealed that AtKinesin-13A was co-localized with Golgi stacks in Arabidopsis root tip cells. Immuno-electron microscopic observations indicated that AtKinesin-13A is primarily localized on Golgi-associated vesicles in Arabidopsis root-cap cells. By T-DNA insertion, the inactivation of the AtKinesin-13A gene (NM-112536) resulted in a sharp decrease of size and number of Golgi vesicles in root-cap peripheral cells. At the same time, these cells were vacuolated in comparison to the corresponding cells of the wild type..
PMC4854396	Results. . Screening for chilling sensitive mutants from a large collection of T-DNA mutants. In order to identify genes important for chilling tolerance in Arabidopsis at the genome scale, we analyzed 11,000 T-DNA insertion mutants covering half of the total Arabidopsis genes for chilling sensitive phenotypes. Each of them is putative homozygous T-DNA knockout or knockdown mutants in indexed genes generated by the SALK Institute [32] and available from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (http://abrc.osu.edu/). The use of these indexed knockout or knockdown lines over chemical mutagenized population enabled the assessment and verification of phenotypes under different growth conditions and allowed uncovering of conditional lethal mutants and avoiding temperature-sensitive alleles of essential genes. In this screen (S1 Fig), four mutant seeds of each line were germinated and grown side by side with the wild-type Col-0 on vertical plates under a 16 hours (h) light/day photoperiod first at 22C for 8 days and then transferred to 4C for two months. Lines showing abnormal growth phenotypes compared to the wild type only at 4C but not 22C were selected as chilling sensitive mutants. These phenotypes include albino, yellow or purple leaves, abnormal leaf shapes, smaller leaves, and shorter roots. Because not all of these T-DNA lines were homozygous for the T-DNA insertion mutations, we further analyzed those lines where not all four seedlings exhibited mutant phenotypes to exclude those whose mutant phenotypes are not correlated with the T-DNA insertion. From this screen, a total of 54 lines showed growth defects at 4C but not 22C and we defined these mutants as chilling sensitive (Fig 1A).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006027.g001. Fig 1. . Chilling sensitivity of the RNP mutants.. (A) Shown are wild type Col-0, orrm1, and aml1 mutants grown for 2 months at 4C on the plate under a 16 h light/day photoperiod. Representative chilling sensitive phenotypes are shown. (B) Shown are wild type Col-0, rbd1-1, orrm1, aml1, cp29a, and cp31a mutants grown at 22C and 4C. Top row: Plants grown for 3 weeks at 22C under a 12 hour (h) light photoperiod. Bottom row: Plants grown for 3 weeks at 22C, then shifted to 4C for additional 4 weeks under a 12 h light photoperiod. (C) Shown are fresh weights of the 5 RNP mutants grown at 22C and 4C for 3 weeks and 10 weeks respectively under a 12 h light photoperiod.. . . . We then examined the genes indexed to be disrupted by T-DNA insertions in these lines. Those with insertion in the promoter region but not exon, intron, or UTRs were removed as they might not affect the function of the indexed gene and the phenotype is unlikely due to a defect in the gene. This leaves us with 49 chilling sensitive mutant lines where the function or expression of the indexed genes are disrupted. None of the 49 genes are in the characterized CBF cold acclimation pathway, and loss of function mutants of CBF1, CBF2, CBF3, ICE1, HOS1 and SIZ1 were not in the collection. Although causal genes for chilling sensitivity may not be the indexed gene in a small proportion of the lines, we decide to analyze functional categories of these candidate genes as a group to reveal potential important chilling tolerance mechanisms. Among proteins encoded by the 49 candidate genes, 16 were annotated as localized to the chloroplast (Table 1), 10 to the nucleus, 6 to the cytosol, 4 to the mitochondria, and the rest either to other locations or without localization information. There is thus a high representation of chloroplast related genes in these mutants, suggesting a critical role of chloroplast function in chilling tolerance.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006027.t001.

Among the 16 proteins with chloroplast localization, 4 were chloroplast RNP proteins and three were previously characterized: ORRM1 (AT3G20930), CP29A (AT3G53460) and CP31A (AT4G24770). Mutants of CP29A and CP31A were chilling sensitive and defective in processing various RNAs in chloroplast [13]. ORMM1 is required for plastid RNA editing in Arabidopsis and maize [33], but its role in chilling tolerance has not been analyzed. The other RRM/RBD/RNP coding gene, AT1G70200, was not characterized before, and we named it RBD1. Mutants of all of these 4 genes showed bleaching in newly emerging leaves at 4C. A mutant of another RNP coding gene AML1 (AT5G61960) also had a bleaching phenotype. AML1 is predicted to localize in the nucleus but it may also have a chloroplast localization signal from the e-FP data. It plays a role in meiosis as well as in vegetative growth in Arabidopsis thaliana [34], but its role in chilling tolerance was not analyzed. We therefore further analyzed chilling sensitive phenotypes of mutants of these 5 RNP coding genes. When grown on soil at the normal temperature 22C, the rbd1, cp29a and cp31a mutants exhibited a wild-type phenotype, while orrm1 and aml1 had a smaller size than the wild type Col-0 (Fig 1B). The aml1 had yellow cotyledons at germination but recovered in a few days, and it often had white strips on the leaves. Consistent with visual phenotypes, the rbd1, cp29a and cp31a mutants has a fresh weight similar to that of the wild type at 22C, but orrm1 and aml1 mutants displayed a 35% and 58% reduction compared to the wild type (Fig 1C). When shifted to 4C after grown at 22C for three weeks, new leaves emerged from all of these mutants were yellow (Fig 1B). When these mutants were grown constantly at 4C in soil from germination, all their leaves were yellow and the plants were much smaller than the wild type with only 10% to 35% of the wild-type fresh weight (Fig 1C).. . . RBD1 is required for chloroplast function especially under chilling stress conditions. We chose RBD1 for further analysis because there were no prior reports on this gene. The RBD1 gene encodes a protein of 538 amino acids (aa) containing one RNA recognition motif/ RNA-binding domain (Fig 2A). We confirmed that the chilling sensitive phenotype observed in the mutant line SALK_041100 is due to the loss of the RBD1 function through analysis of additional RBD1 mutants and complementation test. The SALK_041100 line (named rbd-1) has the T-DNA inserted in the third exon of the RBD1 gene, while the T-DNA insertion line SALK_012657 (named rbd1-2) has an insertion in the 5-UTR of RBD1 (Fig 2B). Both mutants were loss-of-function mutants of RBD1 as no full length transcripts could be amplified by Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR (Fig 2C). The rbd1-2 mutant, like rbd1-1, produced yellow emerging leaves at 4C (Fig 2D). In addition, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to reduce the expression of RBD1, and 13 of 15 RNAi transgenic lines produced yellow leaves under chilling conditions (Fig 2D). Furthermore, when the full-length RBD1 cDNA driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter was transformed into the rbd1 mutants, the chilling sensitive phenotype was suppressed in 30 of 32 the transgenic lines (Fig 2D). Therefore, the loss of RBD1 function does confer chilling sensitivity.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006027.g002. Fig 2. . Characterization of the rbd1 mutants.. (A) Structure diagram of the RBD1 protein.

Bottom row: plants grown for 3 weeks at 22C, then shifted to 4C for additional 4 weeks with 12h light /12h dark. (E) The rbd1-1 plants at 2 days of 22C recovery after 3 weeks of 4C treatment. (F) The accumulation of pigments in rbd1 mutants and complementation lines. Shown are contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoid from the fifth and sixth leaves of 2 weeks old plants grown at 22C with constant light. Means  SD, n = 3, * represents significant differences between means at P < 0.05 according to Students t test.. . . . We characterized the growth phenotypes of the rbd1-1 mutants in more detail. When plants were shifted from three weeks growth at 22C to 4C, the yellowing or bleaching became visible only after 2 weeks of chilling treatment and only happened in leaves emerged at 4C. There is a gradient of yellowing decreasing from the youngest leaf to the oldest leaves (Fig 2D). This yellowing phenotype is reversible, when plants were moved from 4C back to 22C, the pale green phenotype disappeared in 2 days (Fig 2E). The rbd1-2 mutant also had a lighter green appearance compared to the wild type when grown constantly at 22C. Using spectrophotometer, we found that the two rbd1 mutants had a 10-20% reduction of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids compared to the wild-type Col-0. This phenotype was not observed in the complemented lines (Fig 2F). Therefore, the rbd1 mutants are compromised in chloroplast function especially under chilling conditions.. . . Loss of RBD1 does not affect the expression of CBF or COR genes. Because the rbd1 mutants displayed chilling sensitivity, we analyzed whether chilling induction of the CBF and COR genes was altered in the rbd1 mutants. CBF1, CBF2, and CBF3 are induced by 4C treatment at 6 hours to the same extent in Col-0 and rbd1-1 (Fig 3A). Similarly, these genes fall to the basal level after 3 weeks of 4C treatment in both the wild type and the mutant (Fig 3A). COR15A, COR47, and KIN1 genes are regulated by the CBF genes, and they were induced by 4C treatment at 6 hours and stayed elevated during the subsequent chilling treatment for four weeks (Fig 3B). The rbd1-1 mutant had the same induction kinetics and amplitudes of these three COR genes by 4C treatment (Fig 3B). Therefore, the rbd1-1 mutant is not impaired in its capacity to induce the CBF or COR expression by 4C and the chilling sensitivity of the mutants is likely independent of the CBF pathway.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006027.g003.

RNAs were isolated from five newly emerging leaves from 2 weeks old plants grown at normal condition followed by 4C treatment. The Actin gene was used as a normalization control and the experiments were repeated three times with similar results (A). Equal loading was controlled by cytosolic 25S rRNA (25S) stained with ethidium bromide (B). (C) The expression patterns of RBD1 under 4C. Total RNA was extracted from two weeks old plants chilling-treated for 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. The Actin gene was used as a normalization control. The experiments were repeated three times with similar results.. . . . . . The expression pattern of the RBD1 gene. The RBD1 gene is expressed in green tissues. Using RT-PCR analysis, RBD1 mRNA was detectable in leaves, stems, flowers and siliques but not in roots (Fig 4A). The expression pattern of RBD1 was further investigated in transgenic lines containing a -glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene fused to the RBD1 promoter. GUS expression was observed in all green tissues throughout development (Fig 4B). In 3-day-old seedlings, GUS staining was primarily detected in emerging cotyledons (Fig 4B). In 14-day-old seedlings, it was detected in most of the plant but not in roots, and was particularly strong in cotyledons (Fig 4B). GUS staining was also observed in the stems and siliques, but not in the matured seeds (Fig 4B). Within the flower, it was strong in the sepals and carpels, but not in the stamens and petals (Fig 4B). In addition, older green tissues usually had higher expression levels than younger green tissues, suggesting that RBD1 might contribute to the function of mature green tissues. Altogether, these expression patterns show that RBD1 is highly expressed in the photosynthetic tissues, which was in agreement with its putative roles in chloroplast function.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006027.g004. Fig 4. . Gene expression and protein localization of RBD1.. (A) Detection of RBD1 transcripts in various tissues. Total RNA was extracted from the indicated tissues from plants grown at 22C with constant light. The Actin gene was used as a normalization control. (B) GUS staining of pRBD1::GUS transgenic plants. (C) Shown are confocal microscope images of protoplasts isolated from wild-type Arabidopsis leaves either untransformed or transformed with GFP or RBD1:GFP. A representative image of a single protoplast is shown in each panel. Left panels show the GFP signals, middle panels show the chlorophyll signals, and the right panels show the merged signals.. . . . RBD1 is not induced by light according to the expression data from Arabidopsis eFP Browser (http://bbc.botany.utoronto.ca). It is not induced by chilling treatment either. RT-PCR revealed that RBD1 is expressed at the same level during the chilling treatment from day 0 to day 21 (Fig 3C). The RBD1 gene therefore might be constitutively expressed at the transcript level.. . . RBD1 is localized to the chloroplast. RBD1 is annotated as a chloroplast targeted protein, which could explain its expression in green tissues. To verify the subcellular localization of the RBD1 protein, we expressed GFP (Green fluorescent Protein) fusion of RBD1 under the 35S promoter (RBD1:GFP) in protoplasts isolated from wild-type Arabidopsis leaves and monitored fluorescence by confocal microscopy. While the GFP protein alone was present in the cytoplasm and nucleus, the RBD1:GFP fusion protein was found exclusively in chloroplasts (Fig 4C). In addition, the RBD1:GFP fusion protein was dispersed as small fluorescent particles within chloroplast (Fig 4C), which is reminiscent of nucleoid localization [35]. This localization pattern does not appear to be temperature-dependent. In both 22C and 4C, RBD1:GFP is only present in the nucleoid structure in chloroplast (S2 Fig).. . . The rbd1 mutants are defective in processing of 23S rRNA. The nucleoid localization pattern and the yellowish leaf mutant phenotype promoted us to investigate the role of RBD1 gene in chloroplast RNA processing because nucleoid is the site of rRNA processing and ribosome assembly [36]. We first analyzed total RNAs separated on formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel stained by ethidium bromide. Plastid rRNAs (23S, 16S, 5S, and 4.5S) and cytosolic rRNAs (25S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S) can be easily observed on such gels because they are very abundant [37]. When the same amount of total RNAs was loaded on gel, rbd1-1 and rbd1-2 mutants showed significant reduced accumulation of the 1.1 and 1.3-kb species of the 23S rRNA compared to the wild type under chilling stress conditions, but exhibited almost the same amount of rRNAs as wild type at 22C (Fig 5A).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006027.g005. Fig 5. . Chloroplast translation is inhibited in the rbd1 mutants.. (A) Total RNAs were fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde gels and stained with ethidium bromide. (B) RNA blotting analysis of 23S rRNA processing. Total RNAs extracted from leaves were fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde gels and hybridized to a probe (indicated by a black bar) detecting the 3-end of the 23S rRNA. Equal loading was controlled by the cytosolic 25S rRNA (25S) stained with ethidium bromide. Processing sites in the 23S rRNA precursor were indicated by scissors. Marked numbers indicate the relative amount in the mutant compared to that in Col-0 quantified by Image J. (C) Coomassie Blue staining of total proteins from the wild type and the rbd1 mutants after SDS-PAGE separation. Accumulation of Rubisco Large Subunit (RbcL) is indicated by an arrow. (D) Shown are Col-0, rbd1 mutants and complementation lines grown on solid media in the presence or absence of spectinomycin at 3 mg/L for 7 days. For A, B, and C, plants were grown for 3 weeks at normal condition followed by 4C for 4 weeks, and tissues were collected from five newly emerged leaves.. . . . RNA gel blot hybridization was used to further analyze the defects in 23S rRNA processing. The 23S rRNA with a full length of 2.9-kb is cleaved internally at two sites, yielding fragments of 0.5, 1.1, and 1.3-kb in wild type [38]. With a probe detecting the 3-end fragments, we found that 4C treatment did not affect the processing of 23S rRNA transcripts in the wild type (Fig 5B). In contrast, the chilling treated rbd1 mutants accumulated the partially processed 2.9-kb and the 2.4-kb of 23S rRNA at a much higher level than the wild type, while the fully processed product of 1.1-kb rRNA was greatly reduced (Fig 5B).. Consistent with a defect in processing of 23S rRNA which is a component of the chloroplast ribosome, the rbd1 mutants had a reduction in chloroplast translated protein. When total leaf proteins were analyzed on a SDS polyacrylamide gel, the chloroplast Rubisco Large Subunit (RbcL) protein, which is synthesized in chloroplast, was found to have a drastic reduction in rbd1-1 and rbd1-2 mutants compared to the wild type by 4C treatment but not at 22C (Fig 5C). We further analyzed the chloroplast translation efficiency in the rbd1 mutants. Spectinomycin is a chemical inhibitor of chloroplast translation as it prevents translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site on the 30S subunit of 70S ribosomes [39]. When seeds were sowed and grown on 1/2 MS supplied with spectinomycin at a concentration of 3mg/L at 22C, both the rbd1-1 and rbd1-2 mutants exhibited total yellowing while the wild type and the complemented rbd1 mutants maintained some green tissues (Fig 5D). This suggests that translation in chloroplast is compromised in the rbd1 mutants even under non-chilling condition.. . . The rbd1 mutants exhibit a defect in 23S rRNA processing earlier than other defects. We further analyzed the transcripts of 9 chloroplast RNAs in the rbd1 mutants under normal and chilling conditions to assess how broad a role the RBD1 gene might play in chloroplast RNA regulation. They are 16S rRNA, PEP transcribed ndhF, psaA, rbcL, psbB, psbF and petB, NEP transcribed ycf3, and PEP and NEP transcribed rps4. Among these, 16S rRNA, ndhF, psbB, petB, ycf3 and rps4 need to be processed to become mature transcripts.. In contrast to that of 23S rRNA, the processing of 16S rRNA was only slightly affected in the rbd1 mutants compare to Col-0 at 4C but not 22C (S3B Fig). The transcripts for ndhF, psaA and rbcL showed decreased levels under chilling stress compared to the wild-type plant, but displayed similar levels to wild type at 22C (S3A Fig). For psbB, psbF and petB, low temperature down regulated their transcripts levels, but the transcripts were at similar levels in the rbd1 mutants and wild type at 22C and 4C (S3B Fig). The transcripts of ycf3-ex2 and rps4 showed an over-accumulation under chilling condition in the rbd1 mutants compared to the wild type, but exhibited the same levels at 22C (S3C Fig). In all, the loss of RBD1 mainly alters processing of 23S rRNAs but not other chloroplast RNAs we analyzed. It also reduces the expression level of some PEP transcribed genes, but increases the expression of some NEP transcribed genes at chilling temperature.. The leaf yellowing phenotype in the rbd1 mutants likely results from an accumulative defect over time because it only became visible two weeks after plants were shifted from 22C to 4C. To identify earlier defects in the mutants, we monitored the molecular events after the plants were shifted from 22C to 4C at 0 hour (h), 6 h, 1 day (d), 3 d, 7 d, 14d, 21 d and 28 d. Among the 6 genes that showed altered processing and expression in the mutants, 23S rRNA was the first to show defects. Its processed 1.1-kb transcript was significantly lower than the wild type after 7 days of 4C treatment (S4A Fig). The transcript of psaA showed defects in the rbd1 mutants after 2 weeks of cold treatment (S4B Fig). The transcripts of the rest ndhF, rbcL, ycf3-ex2 and rps4 genes began to show significant change after 3 or 4 weeks of chilling treatment (S4 Fig). Therefore, the rbd1 mutants exhibit a defect in 23S rRNA processing very early on (S4B, S4C and S4D Fig), which would lead to reduced chloroplast translation and bleaching phenotype under chilling conditions.. . . RBD1 binds to 23S rRNA transcripts in a temperature dependent manner. To determine whether or not RBD1 protein is associated with the 23S rRNA and the association is temperature regulated, we performed RNA co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assay at both 22C and 4C. RBD1 was fused to the GFP (RBD1:GFP) and expressed under the strong 35S promoter in Arabidopsis protoplasts. As a control, the signal peptide of ORRM1 that targets the protein to chloroplast was fused with GFP (sORRM1:GFP) for protoplast expression as well. After transformation, the protoplasts were incubated at 22C for 8 h before being split for further incubation at 22C and 4C respectively for 12 h to assess temperature dependency of binding. Total proteins from protoplasts were then IPed by the anti-GFP antibodies, and the co-IPed RNAs (after DNase I treatment) were reverse transcribed and detected by quantitative Real Time-PCR. We analyzed four transcripts: 23S rRNA, 16S rRNA, psbF, and rbcL and found binding only to 23S rRNA (Fig 6). Three regions of the 23S rRNA precursor were analyzed: 5 end, middle part, and 3 end, residing in three different processed RNAs. There was an 8, 11 and 6 fold increase of PCR products for the three regions of 23S rRNA precursor in the RBD1:GFP sample compared to the sORRM:GFP sample at 22C (Fig 6A). Furthermore, the fold increase for the three regions were 23, 39 and 19 fold in the RBD1:GFP sample compared to the sORRM:GFP at 4C (Fig 6B). Therefore, RBD1 binds to three regions of 23S rRNA precursor, and the binding is at least two times more at 4C than at 22C. In contrast, no difference was detected for the 16S rRNA, psbF and rbcL between RBD1:GFP sand sORRM:GFP at either 22C or 4C (Fig 6A and 6B), suggesting a specificity of transcript binding for RBD1.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006027.g006.

Primer pairs for 5-terminal (5), middle part (M), and 3-terminal (3) of 23S rRNA were respectively used to amplify RNAs from immuno-precipitates after reverse transcription. DNase I was used to treat the precipitated samples before reverse transcription (RT), and samples not subject to RT were used as control in PCR to ensure there is no genomic DNA contamination.

The GFP fusions of RBD1 (RBD1:GFP) and the signal peptide of ORRM1 (sORRM1:GFP) were expressed in protoplasts of wild-type Arabidopsis leaves at 22C and 4C, and anti-GFP antibodies were used to precipitate the GFP fusions. - and + mean no antibodies and added antibodies respectively.. . . . . . Mutants of the 5 RNP genes have both specific and shared defects. We further compared the molecular defects among the 5 RNP mutants after 4 weeks of 4C treatment. The rbd1 mutants had the most drastic defect in 23S rRNA processing among the 5 RNP mutants. By RNA gel staining, reduction of processed 23S rRNAs compared to the wild type was the most pronounced in the rbd1-1 mutant (Fig 7A). By RNA blotting, the processed 1.1-kb transcript was found to decrease in all of these 5 RNP mutants, with the most severe reduction happening in rbd1-1. The partially processed 2.9- and 2.4-kb transcripts were over-accumulated in these mutants at 4C except for orrm1 (Fig 7B). Among the 5 RNP mutants, the rbd1-1 mutant exhibited the highest ratio of partially processed transcripts (2.4- and 2.9-kb) over processed transcripts (1.1-kb). Consistent with the observed 23S rRNAs processing defect in the 5 RNP mutants, the accumulation of RbcL protein at 4C was reduced to different extent, with an approximately 20% to 40% reduction compared to the wild type (Fig 7C). In contrast to the RbcL protein, TOC75, a cytosol synthesize chloroplast outer membrane protein [40-42], showed an increased amount of 20% to 40% at 4C in the 5 RNP mutants compared to the wild type (Fig 7D). In addition, rbd1-1 showed the highest sensitivity to spectinomycin followed by aml1 among the 5 RNP mutants assayed (Fig 7E). At 3mg/L concentration, all rbd1-1 seedlings turned white and the aml1 mutant was pale yellow, while the other three mutants stayed green similarly to the wild type. These results indicate that loss of RBD1 has a larger effect on 23S rRNA processing compared to other mutants, which may impact chloroplast translation more than the others. It also shows that the ORRM1 mutation has the least impact on rRNA processing.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006027.g007. Fig 7. . Analyses of chloroplast translation in the 5 RNP mutants..

PMC3542051	Results. . Line decreased initial decreased ethylene decreased low light angle 1 (ddd1) has reduced hyponasty due to impaired cell expansion under ethylene treatment. . Arabidopsis line ddd1 was isolated in a forward genetic screen of 35S-CaMV promoter-tagged plants (Weigel et al., 2000), based on its decreased petiole angle phenotype (Polko et al., 2012a). Due to its constitutively reduced petiole angles and decreased responsiveness to both 6h ethylene and 6h low light, the line was initially named decreased initial angle decreased ethylene angle decreased low light angle 1 (ddd1). In the vegetative stage, the distinctive phenotype of ddd1 included compact rosettes, broader leaf blades, and shorter petioles compared to Col-0 plants (Fig. 1A, B). Detailed analysis of ddd1 leaf movement kinetics, using time-lapse photography, confirmed that hyponastic growth upon ethylene and low-light treatment was reduced and that this was the case throughout the duration of the experiment (24h) (Fig. 1C-E and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, induction of the response appears to be moderately delayed by about 1h. In addition, supra-optimal temperature (heat) also resulted in a reduced response in ddd1 (Supplementary Fig. S1B), suggesting that a general genetic determinant of hyponastic growth is affected in this line. To check whether reduced hyponasty in ddd1 could be attributed to mechanical constraints imposed by its compact phenotype and short petioles, its response to spectral (green) shade was assessed. Spectral shade mimics dense canopy conditions leading to hyponasty and petiole elongation (Pierik et al., 2005). Despite the initial difference between petiole angles of Col-0 and ddd1 at the start of the experiment, the 24-h green shade exposure resulted in a comparable increase in petiole angles of both genotypes (Fig. 2A-E). This implies that ddd1 has the potential to show hyponastic growth and indicates that the reduced response to ethylene, low light, and heat is not due mechanical constraints.. . Fig. 1.. .

Asterisks indicate significant differences relative to petiole angle in control-treated plants (P < 0.05) (this figure is available in colour at JXB online).. . . . Ethylene-induced hyponasty depends on unequal growth rates between two sides of the petiole and is driven by local stimulation of cell expansion at the abaxial side of the organ (Polko et al., 2012b). First, the current study tested whether the substantially reduced hyponasty in ddd1 was visible at a cellular level. To do so, cell lengths were measured in epidermal imprints of 1-cm-long petioles after 10h of ethylene and control treatment. Wild-type plants, treated with ethylene, showed increased cell lengths in the proximal ~2mm at the abaxial side of the petiole compared to control (Polko et al., 2012b). However, this study observed no difference in cell lengths after ethylene treatment in ddd1 (Fig. 3A, B), indicating that the reduced hyponastic response is accompanied by a lack of local cell expansion in response to ethylene.. . Fig. 3.. . Epidermal cell lengths of 1-cm-long petioles of the ddd1 line. Data points represent means  SE of cell lengths at the adaxial (A) and abaxial (B) sides of petioles after 10h of ethylene and control treatment (n = 12-16). Asterisks indicate significant differences relative to the cell lengths of control-treated petioles (P < 0.05).. . . . . . The ddd1 line has reduced levels of ROT3 expression which does not affect ethylene sensitivity. To identify the genetic nature of the ddd1 phenotype, Illumina sequencing was employed (Polko et al., 2012a). This revealed that the T-DNA insertion is located on chromosome 2 in the fourth exon of ROTUNDIFOLIA3 (ROT3, At4g36380). Accordingly, ROT3 transcript levels were substantially decreased in ddd1 (Polko et al., 2012a). To confirm that the insertion in ROT3 is causal to the ddd1 phenotype, the previously described rot3-1 mutant (Kim et al., 1998) was examined. rot3-1 has a deletion of at least 1kb in the promoter region and the first intron (Kim et al., 1998). Analysis of petiole angles upon ethylene application showed that the rot3-1 mutant had a significantly reduced hyponastic response, comparable to ddd1 (Fig. 4B). Moreover, rot3-1 has compact rosettes, broad leaves, and shorter petioles, clearly resembling ddd1 (Fig. 4C, D). To confirm the genetic interrelation between ddd1 and rot3-1, this study performed a genetic complementation test by crossing ddd1 and rot3-1. All characteristic phenotypes remained in the F1 heterozygous offspring (Fig. 4C-E), indicating that ddd1 and rot3-1 are allelic. It was therefore concluded that ROT3 is required to mediate the effect of ethylene on cell expansion to induce hyponastic growth and, thus, subsequent experiments were carried out using the rot3-1 line.. .

(C-D) The phenotypes of ddd1 (C), rot3-1 (D), and F1 of a cross between the two lines (ddd1 and rot3-1) (E).. . . . Ethylene sensitivity and cell expansion can be studied using the so-called triple response assay, which in Arabidopsis consists of inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, exaggerated apical hook, and swelling of the hypocotyl in darkness (Bleecker et al., 1988; Guzmn and Ecker, 1990). To test whether impaired hyponasty of rot3-1 is due to a generally reduced responsiveness to ethylene, this study tested the mutants hypocotyl elongation in presence of exogenous ACC. In the absence of ACC, rot3-1 has significantly shorter hypocotyls in darkness, confirming interference of ROT3 with cell expansion. Upon growth inhibition by ACC, the reduction of hypocotyl lengths follows the wild-type pattern and remained significantly shorter up to 1 M. At higher concentrations rot3-1 hypocotyl lengths became similar to wild type (Fig. 5). This result suggests that general sensitivity to ethylene is unaffected in rot3-1 and that effects on hyponasty through ROT3 probably occur downstream of ethylene signalling.. . Fig. 5.. . Inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in darkness by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). Data points represent mean hypocotyl length of Col-0 and rot3-1 seedlings (n = 70-120). Asterisks indicate significant differences between the two treatments (P < 0.05).. . . . . . Brassinosteroid action is required for ethylene-induced hyponasty. . ROT3 encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 family, CYP90C1, an enzyme involved in the conversion of typhasterol to castasterone. The latter is the direct precursor of the bioactive BRs (Kim et al., 2004, 2005). To test whether BR biosynthesis plays a role in regulating ethylene-induced hyponasty, this study tested whether perturbation of BR synthesis reflects on the petiole angle. Brz is an inhibitor of cytochrome CYP450 function specifically in the steroid synthesis pathway (Asami et al., 2000). Its application resulted in reduced petiole angles in both control treatment and upon ethylene treatment. In addition, the ethylene-induced increase in petiole angle was significantly reduced by Brz (Fig. 6, P < 0.05). These results indicate that presence of BR modulates ethylene-induced hyponastic growth. To assess whether BR levels change in response to ethylene exposure in petioles, the concentrations of brassinolide and its direct precursors - castasterone and typhasterol - were measured in the petioles, after 6h of ethylene exposure and in control conditions. No measurable difference in any of the active BRs was observed (Fig. S2) which indicates that total BR levels do not change upon ethylene treatment and that the control of ethylene-induced hyponastic growth by BRs cannot be attributed to putative ethylene-mediated effects on BR synthesis via ROT3. Accordingly, ethylene did not induce transcription of neither ROT3 nor another BR biosynthesis-related gene, BRASSINOSTEROID-6 OXIDASE (BR6OX) (Fig. 7A-C). In fact, 3 and 6h after start of ethylene exposure, the expression of ROT3 and BR6OX declined. This was significant for ROT3 in quarter 2, which corresponds with the abaxial side proximal to the rosette where hyponastic growth is induced (Polko et al., 2012b). Since BR application to petioles in absence of ethylene does not affect petiole angles (data not shown) or general petiole growth, this study tested whether ethylene is capable of interfering with BR responsiveness/sensitivity using an alternative system that involves cell expansion: ethylene-induced hypocotyl elongation in light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings (Smalle et al., 1997). A range of 24-epiBL concentrations was applied to the medium and the effects on hypocotyl elongation under control and high ethylene conditions were examined. In addition, to separate effects of ethylene on biosynthesis from effects on BR responsiveness, a Brz treatment was included to inhibit endogenous BR biosynthesis. 24-epiBL application stimulated hypocotyl elongation in a concentration range between 0.01 and 1 M, but was much more effective in the low concentration range, between 0.001 and 0.1 M, in the presence of ethylene as compared to control air. Application of Brz alone substantially inhibited hypocotyl elongation in ethylene-exposed seedlings, which suggests a role for brassinosteroids in this process (Fig. 8, De Grauwe et al., 2005), consistent with observations described earlier for hyponasty. Exogenous 24-epiBL eliminated this response leading to comparable lengths of hypocotyls in ethylene and ethylene in presence of Brz.. . Fig. 6.. .

The BRC_H161b line insertion maps in the second exon of this gene (at +242 bp from the startcodon), whereas the SALK_136312 line insertion maps 183 bp upstream of the startcodon (Fig. 2). A transposon insertion in the MYB29 gene (At5g07690) is present in line SM3.34316. The insertion maps 44 bp upstream of the MYB29 gene startcodon (Fig. 2).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002068.g002.

The BRC_H161b (myb28) line was crossed with the SM3.34316 (myb29) line and the progeny was self-fertilized to generate homozygous double knock-outs (myb28myb29). The single knock-out lines did not show any visible phenotype, whereas the double knock-out line showed a marginal delay in seed germination and initial growth. In later growth phases, there was no visible phenotypic difference between wild type Col-0 and any of the mutant lines.. . . Double knock-out of MYB28 and MYB29 leads to complete absence of aliphatic glucosinolates. The effect of the myb mutations at the biochemical level was assessed using an untargeted LC-QTOF-MS metabolic profiling approach with methanol/water extracts from mature rosette leaves. From each line, five individual replicates were analyzed. The resulting data matrix (samples vs. mass peaks) contained intensity values for 2615 mass signals (roughly representing 400 compounds) aligned across all samples. To visualize the effect of each mutation, principal components analysis (PCA) of the dataset was performed. As shown in the score plot (Fig. 3), the five biological replicates of each mutant cluster together. The plot also shows that the myb29 mutant is relatively closely related to the wild type, while the myb28 mutant is more distinct in the plot. Remarkably, the double mutant is even more distant from the myb28 mutant than would be anticipated from the effect of myb29 alone.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002068.g003. Figure 3. . Score plot from principal component analysis of LC-MS metabolic profiles of wild type and mutant Arabidopsis lines.. Contributions of principal components to separation of the samples are indicated on the axes.. . . . To analyze which components lead to the separation of the mutants from the wild type, mass signals were selected that significantly differed (p<0.01; n=5) more than two-fold in intensity between the Col-0 wild type and myb28myb29. In the double mutant, 159 mass signals representing 24 different compounds were found to be down-regulated: 11 compounds could be identified as glucosinolates, from the sulphinylalkyl, methylthioalkyl, phenyl and alkyl classes, while the other 13 could not be properly identified due to very low signals (<10-fold background), which do not allow accurate mass calculation and subsequent deduction of the elemental formula. In fact, in the double mutant, the identified downregulated compounds were all reduced to levels that couldn't be detected in the MS. The identified compounds are listed in Table 1. In addition, six compounds (45 mass peaks) were found to be significantly up-regulated by more than two-fold in the double mutant. Among these compounds were two indole glucosinolates (Table 1) and four unidentified compounds with very low intensity signals. Phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and sinapates, which can also affect insect resistance, were specifically assessed, but no strong changes could be observed for e.g. sinapoylmalate and kaempferol-glucoside-rhamnoside (Table 1).

The glucosinolate content of the rosette leaf material was further quantified using a dedicated HPLC analysis. The HPLC chromatograms of the wild type and mutant plants are shown in Fig 4A. The total amount of glucosinolates was quantified from the chromatograms and plotted in Fig 4B. The quantification of each specific glucosinolate is shown in Fig 5. This quantitative analysis confirms the results obtained by the untargeted metabolomics analysis. Short-chain aliphatic methylsulphinylalkyl glucosinolates, such as glucoiberin (3MSOP), glucoraphanin (4MSOB) and glucoalyssin (5MSOP), are reduced by about 50% in both myb28 and myb29 mutants, but are completely absent from the double mutant. The long-chain aliphatic methylsulphinylalkyl glucosinolate glucohirsutin (8MSOO) is not significantly affected in myb29, but has completely disappeared in myb28 and in the double mutant. Glucohesperin (6MSOH) and glucoibarin (7MSOH) showed relative changes similar to glucohirsutin (8MSOO) in the LC-MS analysis, but were below the detection level in the dedicated HPLC analysis (Fig. 5). Indolyl glucosinolates, such as glucobrassicin (I3M) and neoglucobrassicin (1MO-I3M), show a slight increase in both single mutants, and are two- to three-fold increased in the double mutant, while 4-methoxyglucobrassicin (4MO-I3M) is not significantly increased. Knock-out of both MYB28 and MYB29 thus completely suppressed synthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates below detection level.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002068.g004. Figure 4. .

Therefore they are represented as ion counts (arbitrary units; a.u.).. . . . . . Characterization of the myb28myb29 mutant by gene expression analysis. To further understand the mechanism by which double knock-out mutation of MYB28 and MYB29 genes leads to complete collapse of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, real-time RT-PCR assays were performed. Gene expression levels of MYB28, MYB29 and several genes involved in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis (MAM1, MAM3, CYP83A1 and an aconitase) or indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis (CYP83B1) were monitored in mature expanded rosette leaf material from the Col-0 wild type, the myb28 mutant (BRC_H161b), the myb29 mutant, and the myb28myb29 double mutant.. Compared to the wild type Col-0, the levels of MYB28 transcripts were strongly affected (60 to 100-fold reduced) in the myb28 and the myb28myb29 mutants (Fig. 6). The MYB29 transcript levels were 4 to 6-fold reduced in the myb29 and myb28myb29 mutant, respectively. Apparently, myb29 is not a knock-out but a knock-down mutant, since there still is some residual expression of MYB29 in the mutant. The MYB28 and MYB29 genes hardly affect each others expression in leaves.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002068.g006. Figure 6. .

Error bars indicate standard deviations (n=3). Characters on the error bars indicate significance groups (p<0.05, Tukey post hoc test). The wild type values were always significance group a.. . . . Biosynthetic genes are dramatically more reduced in expression in the myb29myb28 double mutant, as compared to the single mutants. Expression of MAM3 was already strongly (>10-fold) reduced in the myb28 mutant, but even more (>100-fold) reduced in the myb28myb29 mutant, although the expression in the myb29 mutant was comparable to that in the wild type. The MAM1, CYP83A1 and Aconitase transcripts were hardly affected (<2-fold) in the single mutants, but strongly reduced (140-fold, 30-fold and 300-fold, respectively) in the myb28myb29 double mutant. On the other hand, the levels of the CYP83B1 gene, which participates in the indolic glucosinolate pathway, were not significantly changed in any of knockout lines (data not shown). Thus, knocking out both MYB28 and MYB29 interfered much more severely with expression of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes than was anticipated from the analysis of both single mutants. This suggests a strong redundancy of these transcription factors for the downstream genes tested. MAM3 is an exception, as it is largely controlled by MYB28 and its regulation by MYB29 is epistatic to MYB28.. . . Insect feeding. The myb28myb29 double mutant is to our knowledge the first Arabidopsis genotype without aliphatic glucosinolates and it provides the first possibility to assess the relevance of aliphatic glucosinolates on herbivore insect performance. We therefore compared the performance of larvae of the lepidopteran insect Mamestra brassicae on the myb28, myb29 and myb28myb29 Arabidopsis mutants. Mamestra was chosen because its larvae are among the most frequently found pest insects on cabbages [20]. Mamestra is a generalist, which prefers cruciferous species, but has been found feeding on many different plant species, including non-cruciferae [21], [22]. There is some evidence for sensitivity of Mamestra to glucosinolates [23].. In an initial experiment, neonate larvae were transferred to detached leaves of two wild type lines (Col-0 and progeny of a wild type segregant from a MYB28myb28 BRC_H161b heterozygote plant), and knock-out mutants myb28-BRC_H161, myb28-SALK_136312 and myb29. For each experiment, individual larvae were reared separately in Petri dishes, and leaves were refreshed at least every two days. Larvae were weighed after 14 days of feeding. Mutations in MYB28 and MYB29 resulted in enhanced growth rates of Mamestra (Fig. 7A). On day 14, the average weight of larvae raised on wild type plants was two to three times lower than on leaves from knock-out plants (Fig. 7A, ANOVA F4,76 = 17.5, p<0.001). . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002068.g007.

Col-0: n=24; myb28: n=43; myb29: n=51; myb28myb29: n=53.. . . . In a second experiment, Mamestra larvae were tested on groups of hydroponically-grown intact plants. Three replicate groups of 25 neonates were confined to trays with 50 plants of wild type Col-0, myb28-H161, myb29 or myb28myb29. After 12 days, the larvae were weighed individually. Again we found a clear effect of plant genotype on larval mass (Fig. 7B). The body mass of larvae raised on wild type Col-0 plants was significantly lower than that of larvae raised on each of the single mutants (1.7-1.8 times lower), whereas larvae on the double mutant had the highest body mass (2.6 times higher than Col-0; Fig 7C, nested ANOVA genotype effect F3,158 = 33.18, p<0.001). Knocking out both MYB28 and MYB29 genes in Arabidopsis had a significant positive effect on growth of Mamestra larvae, most prominently if both genes were knocked-out.. In a third experiment, the effect of Mamestra herbivory on plants of wild type Col-0, myb28-H161, myb29 or myb28myb29 was compared. Four replicate groups of eight plants of each line were separately grown in hydroponic trays. On two of the replicates, 16 Mamestra neonates were positioned, while the other two replicates were not exposed to insects. After 10 days, the damage to each of the insect-treated replicates was ranked by five observers after double-blind visual inspection. As shown in Fig. 8, Mamestra herbivory resulted in higher damage levels in the myb28myb29 mutant, as compared to the Col-0 wild type, while both single mutants had intermediate damage levels. These data are consistent with the higher weight of larvae feeding on the myb28myb29 mutant.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002068.g008. Figure 8. . Plant damage after 10 days of Mamestra feeding.. (A) Ranking by five observers from 1 (lowest damage) to 7 (highest damage). Different characters over the bars indicate significant differences between the treatments after Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Multiple Comparison analysis (2-tailed). (B) Pictures of representative plants of wild type Col-0 and myb28myb29 on day 10 of Mamestra feeding.. . . . In the same experiment, the content of glucosinolates was measured for the leaves, with and without Mamestra herbivory. In Table 2, the effects of herbivory for all four tested lines are shown. The values in this table were obtained by setting the concentrations of all glucosinolates in Col-0 (without herbivory) at value 1.00, and comparing the concentrations found in the other samples (with and without herbivory) to this value. In the Col-0 wild-type, three effects of Mamestra herbivory can be observed. Firstly, most glucosinolates (aliphatic and others) were increased by a factor 1.5 to 2. Secondly, there is a pronounced increase of the indolic glucosinolates glucobrassicin (I3M; >2 fold) and neoglucobrassicin (1MO-I3M; >6 fold). Thirdly, herbivory results in a strong decrease of glucoerucin (4MTB; a methylthioglucosinolate), which is a precursor of glucoraphanin (4MSOB; a methylsulfonylglucosinolate). In the myb28 and myb29 mutants, these three trends persist. For example in the myb28 mutant, the concentration of glucoraphanin (4MSOB) is 41% of that in Col-0, and in the insect-damaged plants glucoraphanin (4MSOB) doubles to 98% of the undamaged Col-0 value (Table 2). In case of the myb28myb29 double mutant, some traces of short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates could be observed after herbivory, up to 3% of the undamaged Col-0 levels. In this mutant, long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates such as glucohirsutin (8MSOO) could not be detected, even after herbivory, while the herbivory-induced increase in indolic glucosinolates was very pronounced (5-10 fold). These observations, made with LC-MS analysis, were confirmed by a targeted HPLC analysis (data not shown). Apparently, the myb28myb29 double mutation strongly inhibits aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, even when Arabidopsis is severely damaged by Mamestra larvae.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0002068.t002.

PMC4290513	Results. . LY294002 affects proline accumulation only in response to salt treatment. To investigate whether PI3K is involved in the regulation of proline metabolism in response to ionic and/or hyperosmotic constraints, the effect of LY294002 on proline accumulation was assessed in 12-days-old Arabidopsis seedlings subjected to either 200 mM NaCl or 400 mM mannitol for 24 h. As shown in Figure 1A, typically a 5- to 6-fold accumulation of proline is observed in Arabidopsis seedlings treated with either NaCl or mannitol in comparison to the control seedlings. Interestingly, while LY294002 had no effect on the proline levels in control seedlings or seedlings stressed with mannitol (Figure 1), 40% less proline accumulated in the LY294002-treated seedlings upon salt stress. When increasing concentrations of LY294002 were applied, proline levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner in plants stressed with NaCl, with a maximum effect observed for 100 muM LY294002 (Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast, no effect on the proline levels of control or mannitol-stressed seedlings where found, whatever concentration of LY294002 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). These results show that LY294002 negatively regulates proline accumulation in response to salt stress but not to mannitol.. . Figure 1. . LY294002 induces a decrease in proline levels only upon salt stress in Arabidopsis. Twelve-days-old seedlings grown on 0.5 MS solid medium were transferred to 0.5 MS liquid medium for treatments. Plants were pre-incubated for 1 h with 100 muM LY294002 or with the same amount of DMSO as a control, and then stressed for 24 h with either 200 mM NaCl or 400 mM mannitol supplemented with 100 muM LY294002 (+) or with the same amount of DMSO as a control (-). The results shown are means  SD of four independent samples. Letters indicate statistical differences in proline level depending on treatment conditions (Two-Way ANOVA test, P < 0.05). FW, fresh weight.. . . . . . LY294002 reduces the level of PI3P. In order to characterize the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on PI3K activity, in vivo PI3P levels were measured. For practical reasons, 6-days-old seedlings were used. These seedlings accumulated slightly less proline than the 12-days-old seedlings after NaCl treatment but the results were consistent, indicating that the younger seedlings perceived and responded well to salt stress (data not shown).. Seedlings were 32Pi-labeled overnight and the lipids extracted and separated by TLC (Supplementary Figure 2). Phosphoinositides (PI, PIP, and PIP2) were quantified using PhosphoImaging (Figure 2A). PI, a structural phospholipid of membranes, represented 11-12 % of the total 32P-labeled phospholipids, and its levels remained fairly constant throughout our experiments. PIP and PIP2 are minor lipid constituents and accounted for 1-2% and 0.1-0.15% of the total phospholipids, respectively. PIP2 progressively increased upon salt stress, reaching a 3-fold increase at 3 h compared to control seedlings, while no significant effects of salt stress were found for PIP levels. Interestingly, LY294002 treatment caused a slight but significant decrease in PIP2 under control conditions as well as in response to salt stress.. . Figure 2. . Effect of LY294002 on the levels of Phosphatidylinositol and its derivatives upon salt stress. Five-days-old seedlings were labeled overnight with 32Pi, pre-incubated for 1 h with 100 muM LY294002 or with DMSO, then were stressed with 200 mM NaCl for 30 min or 3 h in the presence (+LY) or absence of LY294002. (A) Lipids were extracted, separated by TLC and quantified by PhosphoImaging. Data are expressed as percentages of PI, PIP and PIP2 of total 32P-phospholipids and are means  SD of three independent samples containing three seedlings each. A semi-log scale was used for the representation. Significant differences between seedlings treated with or without 100 muM LY294002 are indicated by *(Two-Way ANOVA test, P < 0.05). (B) After TLC separation, PIP spots were scraped-off, deacylated and the resulting GroPInsPs separated by HPLC and quantified by liquid-scintillation counting. The resulting graph represents the variation in PI3P levels at 30 min of treatment expressed as a percentage, with 100% corresponding to the control condition without LY294402. Results are means  SD of three independents experiments. Letters indicate statistical differences in PI3P level depending on treatment conditions (Two-Way ANOVA test, P < 0.05).. . . . In plants, the PIP pool is composed of 3 isomers, PI3P, PI4P, and PI5P (Munnik and Vermeer, 2010). PI4P is the most predominant PIP species (~80-90%), with PI3P and PI5P each accounting for ~5-10% of the PIP pool (Meijer et al., 2001). On TLC, the PIP isomers cannot be separated but by removing their fatty acids and analysing the resulting glycerophosphoinositolphosphates (GroPInsPs) by HPLC, it is relatively easy to distinghuish and quantify the GroPIns3P from the GroPIns4P and GroPIns5P. The latter two are rather difficult to separate (Meijer et al., 2001).. So to determine the PI3P levels under our conditions, TLC-separated 32P-labeled PIP spots from 30 min treated seedlings were scraped off, deacylated and separated by anion-exchange HPLC. At control and salt conditions, PI3P was found to account for ~5% of the PIP pool. Addition of 100 muM LY294002, however, induced a 50% decrease of PI3P, whatever control or stress condition (Figure 2B). These results, and the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on proline accumulation in response to salt stress, are consistent with the involvment of PI3P as a lipid mediator on the regulation of proline metabolism.. . . LY294002 impacts the expression of genes involved in proline metabolism. Proline accumulation is the consequence of a tight regulation of gene expression (Szabados and Savour, 2010; Liang et al., 2013). We investigated transcript accumulation of two genes involved in proline metabolism, P5CS1 and ProDH1 that encode key enzymes regulating proline biosynthesis and catabolism, respectively. RT-qPCR analysis showed a 17-fold higher AtP5CS1 transcript accumulation in seedlings upon 3 h salt stress than in control ones (Supplementary Figure 3), which lower to 3-fold at 24 h salt stress. In addition, salt stress induced a slight accumulation of AtProDH1 transcript but only after 24 h (Supplementary Figure 3).. The role of PI3K on key genes and enzymes involved in proline metabolism was investigated using LY294002. Northern and western blot analysis revealed that LY294002 affected mRNA and protein accumulation in all tested conditions. After 3 h LY294002 treatment, a modest increase of P5CS1 mRNA was observed in control condition while ProDH1 transcripts were not detectable (Figure 3A). A dramatic effect of LY294002 on both P5CS1 and ProDH1 expression compared to non-treated seedlings was observed at 24 h salt stress. In salt stress seedlings treated with LY94002, P5CS1 steady state transcript level was lower than in non-treated ones while ProDH1 transcript level was higher (Figure 3A). In salt stress seedlings treated with LY294002, P5CS1 transcript accumulation decreased by 60% (Figure 3C) compared to non-treated seedlings. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the higher ProDH1 transcript accumulation in presence of LY294002 whatever the growth conditions (Figure 3C). Using western blots, LY294002 triggered P5CS accumulation in control seedlings while P5CS level diminished in salt-treated plantlets. In contrast, LY294002 strongly enhanced ProDH accumulation in both control and salt-treated seedlings (Figure 3B).. . Figure 3. . LY294002 impacts ProDH1 steady state transcript and proteins levels. Northern- and western blot analysis were performed on total RNA or proteins extracted, respectively, from 12-days-old seedlings treated with either 0.5 MS alone (control) or supplemented with 200 mM NaCl (NaCl) during 3 h or 24 h with 100 muM LY294002 (+) or DMSO (-) as described in the legend of Figure 1. (A) Total RNA (10 mug) was loaded in each lane and northern blots were probed with DNA fragments specific for AtP5CS1 and AtProDH1. Methylene blue staining of rRNAs is shown as a loading control. (B) Total proteins (20 mug) were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. Western blots were incubated with specific antibodies directed against AtP5CS and AtProDH proteins. Detection of the immunolabeled proteins was done by autoradiography using an ECL kit. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S Red as control for protein loading (Rubisco). (C) Relative expression levels of P5CS1 and ProDH1 genes measured by real-time quantitative PCR after 24 h treatment as described in (A). Results expressed as percentage compared to APT1 as a reference gene are means  SD of 3 replicates. Letters indicate statistical differences in P5CS1 (blue letter) or ProDH1 (red letter) gene expression depending on treatment conditions (Two-Way ANOVA test, P < 0.05). The results presented in (A,C) were obtained from two independent experiments.. . . . The lower proline accumulation observed in response to salt stress with LY294002 is correlated with a down-regulation of P5CS1 and up-regulation of ProDH1 at both transcript and protein levels. As LY294002 reduced PI3P levels, our data suggest that PI3K is involved in the regulation of proline metabolism.. . . ProDH1 expression is induced in pi3k mutant. To further unravel the role of PI3K in the regulation of proline metabolism, we aimed for Arabidopsis pi3k KO mutants. Unfortunately, however, homozygous pi3k mutants are not viable (Lee et al., 2008b; Gao and Zhang, 2012). To partly resolve this issue, we selected sulfadiazine-resistant seedlings to get hemizygous pi3k mutant (Leshem et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2008a,b). Segregation analysis indicated a 1:1 ratio in sulfadiazine resistant and sensitive seedlings, respectively (data not shown), due to the male gametophytic defect (Lee et al., 2008b). Therefore PI3K/pi3k hemizygous mutants were selected and further analyzed (Figure 4A). PCR-based genotyping of GABI_418H02 pi3k mutants confirmed that no homozygous mutants were obtained from this selection (data not shown).. . Figure 4. . Molecular characterization of the GABI_418H02 pi3k mutant. (A) Schematic representation of the T-DNA insertion in PI3K gene (At1g60490). Boxes indicate exons. In GABI_418H02 mutant, T-DNA insertion is located in the fifth exon of the PI3K gene. Primer 1 (P1) corresponds to LB08409 primer specific to left border of the T-DNA and primers 2 (P2) and 3 (P3) are gene-specific primers used for the genotyping. (B) Expression analysis by RT-qPCR of AtPI3K, AtP5CS1 and AtProDH1 in WT and PI3K/pi3k hemizygous mutant. cDNA were obtained from 12-days-old WT and PI3K/pi3k seedlings. Results expressed as percentage compared to APT1 as a reference gene are means  SD (n = 3). Significant differences of gene expression between WT and hemizygous seedlings are indicated by *(Student's T-Test, *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01).. . . . Expression analysis by RT-qPCR revealed a 25% decrease of steady-state PI3K transcript level in pi3k hemizygous mutants compared to WT (Figure 4B). In this mutant, ProDH1 transcript level was almost 5-fold higher than in WT seedlings in normal growth condition. On the contrary, no difference in P5CS1 transcript level was observed between WT and pi3k hemizygous mutant.. When WT and pi3k hemizygous mutant were subjected to 200 mM NaCl for 24 h, they showed a higher proline accumulation of 18-fold and 11.5-fold, respectively (Figure 5A). pi3k hemizygous mutant showed a lower proline accumulation in response to NaCl. However the proline accumulation was not significantly different from WT seedlings, probably due to the remaning PI3K wild-type allele.. . Figure 5. . ProDH1 transcript and protein levels are affected in pi3k hemizygous mutant. Twelve-days-old WT and pi3k hemizygous mutant (PI3K/pi3k) seedlings were stressed with 200 mM NaCl (NaCl) or maintained in 0.5 MS (control, C) during 3 h or 24 h. (A) Proline levels were measured in 24 h-stressed seedlings. Results shown are means  SD of 6 to 10 biological repetitions in two independent experiments. FW, Fresh Weight. (B) Expression levels of P5CS1 and ProDH1 genes by RT-qPCR on cDNA obtained from 3 h to 24 h- treated WT and pi3k hemizygous mutant seedlings. Results expressed as percentage compared to APT1 as a reference gene are means  SD (n = 3). Letters indicate statistical differences in P5CS1 (blue letter) or ProDH1 (red letter) gene expression in WT and pi3k hemizygous mutant depending on treatment conditions (Two-Way ANOVA test, P < 0.05). (C) Total proteins obtained from 3 h to 24 h-stressed WT and pi3k hemizygous mutant seedlings were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were incubated with specific antibodies directed against AtProDH proteins. Detection of the immunolabelled proteins was done by autoradiography using an ECL+ kit. Membranes were stained with Ponceau Red as control for protein loading (Rubisco).. . . . P5CS1 and ProDH1 transcript levels were investigated in pi3k hemizygous seedlings in response to 3 and 24 h of salt stress (Figure 5B). P5CS1 mRNA accumulation was similar in WT and pi3k hemizygous in response to salt stress. An equivalent increase of P5CS1 transcripts was observed at 3 h of stress and a decrease at 24 h of stress. Higher ProDH1 transcript levels than WT were observed in pi3k mutant in all tested conditions whether the seedlings were subjected to salt stress or not (Figure 5B). In pi3k hemizygous mutant, ProDH protein levels were stronger than in WT at both 3 and 24 h salt stress (Figure 5C). These results indicate that pi3k hemizygous seedlings are able to respond to salt stress, triggering P5CS1 gene expression and proline accumulation, although the transcript level of ProDH1 gene is increased. Alltogether, our data indicate that the higher level of ProDH1 transcripts is correlated with higher ProDH amount in pi3k mutant. These data are consistent with those obtained with LY294002 treatment (Figure 3), where LY294002 induced higher ProDH1 transcripts and proteins. These results further strengthen the participation of a PI3K-mediated pathway regulating proline catabolism.. . . LY294002 affects seedling metabolome. To investigate other changes induced by LY294002, we compared the metabolite profiles of 12-days old WT seedlings treated with LY294002 or DMSO upon control and salt stress conditions. Hierarchic clustering analysis indicated that DMSO did not have any significant effect on the relative metabolites contents, indicating that the difference in the metabolite patterns obtained with LY294002 is an effect of the inhibitor (Figure 6). Treatment for 24 h of salt stress significantly modified the amounts of several metabolites. Relative amounts of sucrose, ribose and maltose as well as proline, serine and raffinose increased in response to salt stress (Figures 6, 7B). On the contrary, the amounts of some other sugars, like galactose, mannose, trehalose and xylose (Figure 6) and glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose-6-P) and fructose-6-phosphate (Fructose-6-P) decreased in response to salt stress (Figure 7A). LY294002 reduced the level of proline content almost by half (Figure 7B), in accordance with our previous results (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). Interestingly, two other compatible osmolytes, serine and raffinose, exhibited an accumulation pattern similar to that of proline, i.e., higher accumulation in response to salt stress and lower when LY294002 is added (Figure 7B). Surprisingly, LY294002 addition had a strong impact on some amino-acid levels whatever the treatment. The most dramatic effect being for tyrosine with an almost 100-fold increase in the presence of LY294002, in either control condition or NaCl stress (Figure 7C). Similarly, a 10-20-fold increase was observed for lysine, leucine, isoleucine and phenylalanine and a 4-fold increase for valine in response to LY294002.. . Figure 6. . Hierarchic clustering of metabolite changes in WT seedlings subjected to NaCl and LY29002. Metabolite relative content was investigated in 12-days-old Arabidopsis wild-type seedlings treated during 24 h as explained in Materials and Methods and analyzed using hierarchic clustering tool (MEV4.0). The color scale shows the concentration ratios in log2.. . . . . Figure 7. . Variation of metabolite content in Arabidopsis seedlings in response to salt stress with or without LY294002.

Letters in (A-C) indicate statistical differences in metabolite levels depending on treatment conditions (Two-Way ANOVA test, P < 0.05).. . . . Thus, the strong increase of those aliphatic and aromatic amino acids in presence of LY294002 suggests that PI3K, and/or its product PI3P, negatively regulates their metabolism through inhibition of their synthesis and/or promotion of their catabolism..
PMC2682494	ResultsTranscriptomic analysis of a GPA1 null mutant suggests a role for Galpha in JA-dependent gene expressionA role for the Galpha subunit and G-proteins in ABA signalling is well documented (Wang et al., 2001; Jones and Assmann, 2004; Pandey and Assmann, 2004; Pandey et al., 2006) and it was decided to test the effect of Galpha loss of function on the ABA-responsive transcriptome (http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/narrays/experimentpage.pl?experimentid=57). RNA samples were obtained from seedlings treated with or without 100muM ABA for 3h. Although 684 genes showed a >2-fold change in expression after ABA treatment in the wild type, >90% of these genes were also regulated >2-fold in gpa1-1. In addition, expression of genes including KIN1/2 and P5CS in response to ABA was indistinguishable between the wild type and gpa1-1 by northern blot analysis (data not shown). The lack of a significant effect of the gpa1-1 mutation on ABA-responsive gene expression in the analysis using whole seedlings may suggest that the role of Galpha in ABA-regulated gene expression is tissue specific (e.g. guard cells). Alternatively, as it has been reported that exogenously applied ABA leads to an increase in GPA1 protein detectable by immunoblot analysis (Pandey et al., 2006), it cannot be ruled out that Galpha is acting independently of changes in gene expression during the first 3h of response to ABA.To exploit further the data set generated, the differences in expression of genes in gpa1-1 compared with the wild type was examined in the non-ABA-treated seedlings. It was found that 134 genes were >1.5 times differentially expressed (67 down- and 67 up-regulated) in gpa1-1 compared with the wild-type control in this comparison (for a full list see Supplementary Table S1available at JXB online). Since plant G-proteins mediate the responses of several plant hormones (Fujisawa et al., 2001; Perfus-Barbeoch et al., 2004), it was examined whether these 134 genes were enriched in genes previously reported to be regulated by hormones. The Affymetrix transcriptomic data sets from the TAIR Microarray database (http://www.arabidopsis.org) were used for this analysis. By calculating how many of the genes from the list of 134 gpa1-1-affected genes were also regulated by each hormone, it was determined whether genes which respond to a particular hormone were more abundant in this list than would be expected by chance (Supplementary Table S2). Using this approach, it was observed that genes regulated by ABA and MeJA were most significantly enriched, by 2.7- and 2.8-fold, respectively. Binomial probability analyses indicated that this enrichment was particularly high for ABA- (probability of FALSE; 1.98E-06) and MeJA-regulated (1.45E-03) genes (Supplementary Table S2). Enrichment for genes regulated by ACC (a precursor of ethylene), brassinolide, GA, IAA, and zeatin was not significant. This comparative transcriptomic analysis of gpa1-1 and the the wild type consisted only of a single biological replicate. Nevertheless, it suggested a role for the Galpha subunit in the response of Arabidopsis to MeJA, and consequently further analyses were performed to investigate this.The Galpha subunit regulates MeJA-dependent chlorophyll reductionIn light of the preliminary transcriptomic data that were obtained, the physiological characteristics of Galpha mutants in response to MeJA were then investigated. It has been reported that JA and related compounds reduce chlorophyll content when applied exogenously to leaves (Parthier, 1990). Test were first carried out to determine whether Galpha mutants were impaired in JA-dependent chlorophyll reduction. Eleven-d-old seedlings were treated with 0muM or 50muM MeJA for 3d and the chlorophyll levels in cotyledons were measured. The ratio of total chlorophyll between MeJA-treated and non-treated cotyledons is shown in Fig. 1A and B. As described by Parthier (1990), MeJA-treated wild-type plants became significantly more yellow, particularly in the cotyledons, and the total chlorophyll was reduced to 33.5% and 19.8% of that of an untreated WS and Columbia ecotype control, respectively. However, gpa1 mutants retained >40% chlorophyll after MeJA treatment.Fig. 1.MeJA-dependent chlorophyll regulation is reduced in gpa1 mutants. Eleven-day-old plants grown on MS agar plates were treated with either MeJA (A and B) or DEX (C) for a further 3d. Top views of the seedlings treated with MeJA for 3d are shown in (A): WT ws, Wassilewskija wild type; VE, empty vector transgenic line; wGalpha, Galpha overexpressor plants; and in (B) Galpha mutants, gpa1-1, gpa1-2; and WT ws, Wassilewskija wild type. Cotyledons of the representative plants treated with DEX for 3d are also shown in (C) Galpha mutants, gpa1-3, gpa1-4; and WT col, Columbia wild type. Total chlorophyll was extracted from the cotyledons of these plants and the chlorophyll levels are shown as the ratio between treated and non-treated control plants. Bars represent 1 mm.Inducible (by DEX) ectopic expression of Galpha caused leaves to be paler due to a reduction in chlorophyll compared with control plants (Fig. 1C), while DEX treatment did not change the total chlorophyll content in wild-type or in empty vector transformant (VE) control plants. It was previously reported that overexpression of the Galpha subunit resulted in reduced expression of both CAB and RBCS (Okamoto et al., 2001). Whilst this finding cannot be formally attributed to MeJA responses specifically, as this effect occurs in the absence of exogenously applied MeJA, the current results strongly suggest that the Galpha subunit has a role in the regulation of chlorophyll levels in response to JA signalling.Galpha subunit regulates JA-dependent root growth inhibitionJA regulation of seedling and root growth (Lorenzo and Solano, 2005) is one of the most well examined phenotypes in Arabidopsis. In order to investigate further the role of Galpha in JA signalling, JA-dependent root growth inhibition was measured in gpa1 mutants and a range of JA concentrations that have been used for this assay was tested (Staswick et al., 1992). The results showed that gpa1 mutants are significantly insensitive to 1muM MeJA compared with the wild type (Fig. 2A, B). Staswick and colleagues demonstrated that at 1muM MeJA Columbia ecotype roots showed 50% growth inhibition (Staswick et al., 1992), which is consistent with the present assay (Fig. 2A). The difference in root length between the wild type and gpa1 mutants was statistically significant in all four alleles. It was then tested if overexpression of Galpha is also sufficient for the inhibition of root growth. The result showed that the root growth was >50% inhibited by Galpha overexpression (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that Galpha has a positive role in response of roots to JA.Fig. 2.MeJA-dependent root growth regulation is reduced in gpa1 mutants. Seedlings were grown on half-strength MS agar medium containing the indicated amount of MeJA for 11d and the root lengths were measured. (A) Mean root lengths of gpa1-3 and 1-4 as well as the WT (wild-type) Columbia ecotype and the coronatine-insensitive 1 (coi1-16) mutant that is insensitive to root growth inhibition by exogenous MeJA are shown. (B) Mean root length of gpa1-1 and 1-2 in the Wassilewskija (WS) background is shown with the WS wild type. (C) Inhibition of root growth by overexpression of Galpha is shown along with the WS wild-type control and the vector transformant control. The asterisk represents a significant difference in mean root length between the mutant line and the respective wild type (P<0.05) by Student's t-test for one-tailed assuming equal variance. Error bars represent the SD.The gpa1-1 mutant is impaired in JA-inducible gene expressionThe Affymetrix transcriptome data indicated that JA regulation of gene expression may be affected in gpa1 mutants. The regulation of one of the best characterized MeJA-inducible genes, VSP1, was therefore examined (although it was not on the Affymetrix arrays that was used). Ther results show that VSP1 was induced by MeJA in wild-type plants, with the highest accumulation detected 4-6h after MeJA application. Significantly, induction of VSP1 transcript was severely affected in the gpa1-1 mutant, with only very low levels of expression detectable (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the probe used for VSP1 has 90% sequence identity to VSP2 and it cannot be ruled out that the combined expression of both genes is being measured. However, VSP2 is less sensitive than VSP1 to JA induction and it is therefore believed that VSP1 expression is primarily being measured.Fig. 3.MeJA-inducible genes are misregulated in the gpa1 mutant. The MeJA induction time courses of JA-inducible genes were examined using 10-d-old wild-type (WT) and gpa1-1. The expression of MeJA-inducible genes, VSP1/2, PDF1.2b, and putative Thionin in gpa1-1 and the wild type after incubation with 50muM MeJA for the indicated time is shown. A 10mug aliquot of total RNA was loaded on each lane and beta-tubulin was used as a loading control.Although they are not solely regulated by JA, the basal expression levels of several PDF1.2 genes were found to be expressed relatively more strongly in gpa1-1 than in wild-type plants in the transcriptome data (Supplementary Table S2at JXB online). PDF1.2b gene expression was therefore examined in gpa1-1. PDF1.2b was induced by MeJA in wild-type plants, with expression peaking at 8h (Fig. 3), but MeJA-dependent PDF1.2b expression was detectable much earlier in gpa1.Similarly to PDF1.2b, expression of the putative Thionin gene (At1g66100) was found to be relatively low in gpa1 compared with the wild-type in the transcriptome data. Thionins are small cysteine-rich proteins with antimicrobial activity (Pelegrini and Franco, 2005) and are known to be induced by MeJA. The putative Thionin predicted amino acid sequence shows a sequence identity of 59% and 57% to Thi2.2 (At5g36910) and Thi2.1 (At1g72260) genes, respectively. In order to verify that gpa1-1 is impaired in MeJA induction of this putative Thionin, expression of this gene was also analysed by RNA blot analysis. The result indicated that the putative Thionin gene is inducible by MeJA in wild-type plants and that the expression peaks at 6h. However, Thionin gene expression was below the level of detection by northern analysis in the gpa1-1 mutant even 6h after MeJA application (Fig. 3). Together these data suggest that the loss of the Galpha subunit affects JA-responsive gene expression.The gpa1-1 mutant retains wild-type levels of JA and related precursorsOne possible explanation for the enrichment of JA-regulated genes among the gpa1-1-affected genes is that the gpa1-1 mutant might have altered levels of endogenous JA. In order to determine if this was the case, levels of endogenous free JA and the related precursors, OPDA and dinor-OPDA, were measured in 3-week-old rosette leaves of the wild type and gpa1-1. There were no significant differences in any of these JA-related compounds in wild-type and gpa1-1 plants (Fig. 4A). Although the data were obtained from adult leaf tissue and not seedlings, they demonstrate that the gpa1-1 mutant does not show gross effects on JA biosynthesis.Fig. 4.Galpha does not affect endogenous JA levels. (A) JA and its precursors OPDA and dinor-OPDA contents were measured using 3-week-old rosette leaves of WS wild type and gpa1-1. Three leaves were harvested from each plant and averages of 11 independent measurements are shown. Error bars represent the SDs. (B) The MeJA induction time course of a JA biosynthesis gene, AOS, was examined using 10-d-old wild-type (WT) and gpa1-1 treated with 50muM MeJA for the indicated times. The loading control is the same as in Fig. 3. (C) AOS gene expression was examined with or without MeJA and Galpha overexpression. Eleven-day-old seedlings were treated first with or without DEX for 3d and were incubated with or without 50muM MeJA for 6h. WT, Wassilewskija wild-type control and transgenic plants; VE, vector only transformant; wGalpha, transgenic plant inducibly overexpressing the Galpha subunit. beta-Tubulin was used as a loading control. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)The JA biosynthesis positive feedback pathway is intact in gpa1JA biosynthesis is autoregulated, and exogenous application of MeJA induces genes involved in JA biosynthesis such as AOS (Stenzel et al., 2003). In order to determine if the positive feedback mechanism of JA biosynthesis pathways was affected in Galpha mutants, AOS induction in response to exogenous application of MeJA was examined in wild-type and gpa1-1 mutant plants. As shown in Fig. 4B, MeJA induction of AOS is intact in the gpa1-1 mutant and is indistinguishable from that in the wild type.To confirm further that Galpha is not modulating the JA biosynthesis pathway, AOS expression in the transgenic line inducibly expressing the Galpha subunit (Okamoto et al., 2001) was analysed in the presence and absence of MeJA. AOS expression was not influenced by the overexpression of the Galpha subunit under either set of conditions (Fig. 4C), indicating that the gain of functional Galpha subunit does not have any effect on JA biosynthesis. These results indicated that the altered basal expression of JA-regulated genes in gpa1 mutants is most likely to have resulted from an alteration in the sensing of or response to JA.Expression of ERF1 and AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 is not affected in gpa1PDF1.2 expression is positively regulated via the ethylene response factor 1, ERF1, overexpression of which is sufficient to increase PDF1.2 expression (Anderson et al., 2004). The exaggerated expression of PDF1.2 in gpa1 mutants could therefore have been due to overexpression of ERF1. Thus, the expression of ERF1 in gpa1 was investigated. The level of ERF1 hybridization signal on the gpa1-1 Affymetrix array was similar to that of the wild type. This was confirmed by northern analysis: the basal level of expression as well as MeJA induction of ERF1 in the gpa1-1 mutant was indistinguishable from that of the wild type (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). These data indicate that increased PDF1.2 expression in gpa1 mutants is therefore unlikely to be caused by misregulation of ERF1 transcription factor gene expression.Co-overexpression of AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 suppresses the induction of PDF1.2 by ERF1, and AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 has been suggested to act epistatically on ERF1 activation of PDF1.2 (Anderson et al., 2004). Conversely, mutations in AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 result in increased expression of PDF1.2 (Lorenzo et al., 2004) and reduced expression of VSP1 (Berger et al., 1996), leading to the proposal that AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 positively induces VSP1 while it negatively regulates PDF1.2. The expression of VSP1/2 and PDF1.2 in gpa1 is similar to that in the atmyc1/jin1 mutant and it was therefore possible that AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 transcription factor gene expression may be reduced in gpa1. However, this was not the case and, as for ERF1, basal expression as well as MeJA-dependent induction of AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 in the gpa1-1 mutant was indistinguishable from that of the wild type (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online).Galpha overexpression affects transcription of VSP1/2 but does not affect that of AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1As described above, the gpa1-1 mutant and jin1 mutants lacking AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 show very similar patterns of expression with respect to regulation of VSP1 and PDF1.2 genes. However, unlike jin1 mutants, expression of AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 is indistinguishable from the wild type in gpa1-1. It is therefore possible that Galpha regulates VSP1/2 independently of AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 gene expression. If this is the case, overexpression of the Galpha subunit should not affect AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 gene expression but would still be sufficient for the expression of VSP1/2. Galpha-overexpressing plants accumulated a significantly increased level of VSP1/2 compared with the non-induced control in the absence of MeJA (Fig. 5A). These data show that Galpha overexpression is sufficient for induction of VSP1/2 expression. Significantly though, Galpha overexpression did not induce the accumulation of AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 (Fig. 5A). It should also be noted that VSP1/2 accumulation was not detectable when the DEX-treated Galpha plants were kept in darkness (Fig. 5A), even when Galpha overexpression was induced to 3 times higher levels than in the light (Fig. 5C). This shows that overexpression of the Galpha subunit was sufficient to induce VSP1/2 expression in the light but not in darkness, and indicates that induction of VSP1/2 also requires an additional light input.Fig. 5.Galpha overexpression is sufficient for the induction of VSP1 and PDF1.2 genes. Eleven-day-old WS, wild-type control and transgenic plants; VE, vector only transformant; and wGalpha, transgenic plant inducibly overexpressing the Galpha subunit were treated with or without DEX under light and in complete darkness for 3d. A 10mug aliquot of total RNA was loaded on each lane and the same blot was probed with (A) AtMYC2/JIN1/ZBF1 and VSP1/2, (B) ERF1 and PDF1.2, and (C) GPA1 and beta-tubulin as a loading control.Galpha overexpression is sufficient for the transcription of PDF1.2 and ERF1In order to examine further the role of Galpha in the regulation of the PDF1.2 gene, the expression of PDF1.2 in Galpha-overexpressing plants was also tested. Figure 5B shows that Galpha overexpression increases PDF1.2 in the absence of MeJA. Significantly, Galpha-overexpressing plants also had higher accumulation of ERF1 compared with control plants. These data suggest that the accumulation of PDF1.2 transcripts in Galpha-overexpressing plants is likely to be the result of the accumulation of ERF1.In addition to this, as was seen for the VSP1/2 gene, PDF1.2 gene induction by Galpha overexpression was only detectable when the plants were incubated in the light. In the case of ERF1 gene expression, a moderate induction was consistently detected following Galpha overexpression in the absence of light; however, the induction of ERF1 was higher in the light than in the dark.Comparative transcriptome analysis of gpa1-4 and the wild typeThe preliminary microarray experiment using 22k Affymetrix arrays was performed with the wild type and the gpa1-1 mutant in the WS background. It should be noted that the Affymetrix 22k arrays are designed using the Columbia accession genome sequence. In order to gain further understanding of the global consequence of the loss of Galpha function on gene expression, the transcriptomes of 10-d-old wild-type Columbia ecotype and gpa1-4 mutant seedlings were investigated in a biologically replicated and quantitative microarray comparison. Briefly, seedlings of each biological replicate were treated with 0muM or 20muM MeJA for 6h. Operon Arabidopsis full genome microarrays were used to assess four biological replicates of each genotype. Each slide compared the transcriptomes of MeJA-treated and untreated seedlings of either the wild type or gpa1-4.A total of 822 genes were identified that were >2-fold regulated by MeJA in wild-type seedlings. This statistically significant (P-values <0.01) cohort of genes are shown in Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online. Some genes were detected several times due to multiplication of the probes. Of these 822 genes, 200 were <2-fold regulated in gpa1-4 (Cluster I; Fig. 6A). Of the remaining 622 genes, 527 genes were >2-fold changed in response to MeJA (P<0.01) in the gpa1-4 mutant. In addition, 43 genes in this group showed a change in response to MeJA that was more than twice that observed in the wild type (Cluster IIa and b; Fig. 6A, i.e. the direction of change was the same but was more exaggerated in the mutant. Taken together, 243 out of 822 genes (29%) regulated by MeJA in wild-type seedlings were differentially regulated in gpa1-4.Fig. 6.Loss-of-function Galpha has a significant impact on JA regulation of the transcriptome. (A) JA responsiveness in gpa1-4 was analysed in 822 genes that are >2-fold regulated by MeJA in the wild type. (B) Venn diagram showing the overlap of the 822 genes that were found to be up-regulated by JA in the custom arrays using 10-d-old seedlings, and the 760 MeJA-regulated genes in Affymetrix arrays using 7-d-old seedlings. (C) JA responsiveness in gpa1-4 was analysed in 247 genes that are commonly regulated by MeJA in the custom arrays and the publicly available Affymetrix arrays. The colour scale shows the fold regulation of the genes.The gene set (822 genes) was then compared with the gene set identified as >2-fold regulated by MeJA (760 genes) from Affymetrix array data available from the NASC [http://www.arabidopsis.org (ME00337)], in order to gain cross-platform validation of these observations. Although the biological materials, experimental conditions, and the microarray platforms differed, 247 genes were common to both experiments and data types. The probability of an overlap between randomly chosen sets of 822 genes and 760 genes on custom and 22k Affymetrix arrays, respectively, is <0.1%, meaning that no overlapping genes would be expected between randomly chosen gene sets of these sizes. Given that both arrays are biologically replicated and the differential expression of these genes by MeJA is statistically significant, the 30% overlap observed is meaningful.In this group of 247 genes (Supplementary Table S4 at JXB online), 31 genes were <2-fold regulated in gpa1-4 (Cluster I; Fig. 6C). Of the remaining 213 genes, 194 were also >2-fold regulated by MeJA (P<0.01) in gpa1-4. However, 17 genes (Cluster IIa and b; Fig. 6C) in this group of 194 genes showed a fold regulation that was twice that of the wild type. Together, these analyses show that the regulation of 48 out of 247 (19%) MeJA-regulated genes common to both arrays was misregulated in gpa1-4. These data therefore indicate that a loss of the Galpha subunit affects MeJA-regulated gene expression..
PMC4568572	Results. . Determination of intergenic poly(A) sites. To characterize Arabidopsis intergenic poly(A) sites at a genome level, we used three wild type (WT) datasets from paired-end sequencing in a previous study [12]. More than two million poly(A) tags (PAT) could be mapped to Arabidopsis TAIR10 genome, generating 253,719 cleavage/poly(A) sites. 3-UTRs in TIAR10 genome annotation were extended by 50nt to improve the recovery of PATs that are in the vicinity of authentic 3-UTRs due to microheterogeneity. Cleavage sites in the same gene that are located within 24nt of each other were then grouped into poly(A) site clusters (PACs) to eliminate the impact of microheterogeneity of nearby poly(A) sites [7]. Finally, more than 54,000 PACs are defined by these highly confident PATs, covering 16,834 genes. More than half (~52%) of these PACs fall within 3-UTRs defined by over 90% of all PATs (Table1). About 7% and 4% of PACs map to protein coding regions and introns, respectively. Only few PACs map to 5-UTRs. Approximately 5% of PACs fall within ambiguous regions of the annotated genome owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing. About 30% of PACs map to putative intergenic regions, defined by ~3% of all PATs. These intergenic PACs (IPACs) are located between two annotated genes on the same DNA strand and are retained for further analysis in this study. The number of IPACs according to the original TAIR10 annotation would have been larger if 3-UTRs were not extended by 50nt. This 50nt regions are intergenic according to the original annotation by TAIR10. A total of 7037 PACs from 167,584 PATs lie within the boundaries of TAIR10 transcripts (in the extended 50nt regions). These PACs are denoted as 3-UTR PACs and thus are not included in the study of intergenic PACs.Table 1Genomic distribution of PACs and PATsRegionPAC#PAT#PAC%PAT%3-UTRa. 28,2662,129,94951.77%91.13%Intergenic16,56764,55030.34%2.76%CDS377310,9446.91%0.47%Intron230167444.21%0.29%5-UTR20865670.38%0.28%Exon40627910.74%0.12%Pseudogenic exon10211930.19%0.05%AMBb. 2976114,4365.45%4.90%Total54,5992,337,174100.00%100.00%. a3-UTRs were extended by 50nt beyond the annotated poly(A) site by TAIR10. bAMB: ambiguously mapped at regions that have different annotations due to alternative transcription or RNA processing. . . Distribution of IPACs. To characterize the IPACs, we first calculated distances from each IPAC to its 5 sense gene, 3 sense gene, 5 antisense gene, and 3 antisense gene, respectively (Fig.1). The median distance from IPACs to the upstream 5 sense genes is only 122nt even though 3-UTRs were already extended by 50nt (Additional file 1: Figure S1). This is much shorter than that to 3 sense or antisense genes (2237 to 5165nt), indicating that IPACs tend to be closer to upstream 5 sense genes. This is not surprising because there may be a promoter region before the next gene at the 3-end of the IPAC. What is surprising, however, is the average distance from IPACs to 5 sense genes is 1629nt (more than 13 folds than the median distance 122nt), which indicates that distances from IPACs to 5 sense genes are not distributed evenly.Fig. 1Schema of distances from an IPAC to its nearby genes. Solid lines represent DNA sequences; shaded arrows indicate genes and their transcription directions. The majority of IPACs are in the vicinity of the ends of upstream 5 genes (Additional file 1: Figure S2A). IPACs also tend to be close to the starts of the downstream 3 genes (Additional file 1: Figure S2B). This result indicates that IPACs are more likely to be distributed close to the neighboring genes especially the upstream 5 gene and distribute sparely in the middle of the intergenic regions. Since different intergenic regions are in different lengths, to compare the relative positions of IPACs, we normalized the distances from IPACs to the 5 genes by the lengths of the intergenic regions, and the result is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S2C. The majority of IPACs (8020 out of 16567, ~48%) are located in the start (X-axis0.1) of intergenic regions (Additional file 1: Figure S2C).. For IPACs whose antisense parts are also intergenic, we calculated their distances to the neighboring antisense genes. These IPACs are not as close to the 5 or 3 antisense gene as the sense genes, though they are also close to neighboring genes (Additional file 1: Figures S2D, E, and F). This result indicates that antisense genes have much less impact on IPACs. In other words, IPACs are much more likely to be originated from the sense genes rather than the antisense genes. Interestingly, IPACs are more likely located near 3 antisense genes, which is consistent with the observation that IPACs are closer to sense 5 genes than 3 genes. As shown in Additional file 1: Figure S2F, ~20% (1988 of 16,567) IPACs are located within the first 10% of the intergenic regions, whereas another spike was also observed at the end of the intergenic regions, indicating that IPACs tend to be distributed near both the 5 or 3 antisense genes rather than the middle of intergenic regions.. To estimate background noise, we randomly selected 16,567 nucleotide positions (as to mimic the poly(A) sites; the same number as total IPACs) in intergenic regions. Distances from these random positions to neighbouring sense and antisense genes were calculated as background distances. As shown in Additional file 1: Figure S3, there is a background slope, which may be due to the finite length of intergenic regions in the genome. This background slope was also observed in a previous study [20]. Because a randomly selected position cannot be located at an arbitrary long distance from the nearest gene, the distribution of random positions is slightly skewed toward shorter distances. This slope is greatly reduced after normalizing the distance by the length of the respective intergenic regions (Additional file 1: Figures S3C and F). The distribution of distance from IPACs to 5 sense genes is significantly different from the background distribution (Additional file 1: Figure S2A vs. Additional file 1: Figure S3A). The distribution of distance from IPACs to 3 antisense genes seems also very different from the background distribution (Additional file 1: Figure S2E vs. Additional file 1: Figure S3E). Our results indicated that distributions of PACs are closer to the upstream or downstream sense genes.. . . Classification of IPACs. Based on the distributions of the distances from IPACs to nearby sense and antisense genes, we classified IPACs into three categories (Fig.2): SE-IPAC, IPAC in the 3-UTR extension of its 5 sense gene (Sense-Extension); A-IPAC, IPAC that is located in another antisense gene (Antisense); SO-IPAC, IPAC that is far from all nearby genes (Sense-Orphan). We focused on these three main cases of IPACs, the rest of the IPACs which may be close to the promoter of the 5 sense gene (344) or the 5 and 3 antisense gene (791) were not analyzed in this study due to insignificance in numbers.Fig. 2Schema of different classes of IPACs. SE-IPAC, IPAC in the 3-UTR extension of its 5 sense gene (Sense-Extension); A-IPAC, IPAC that is located in another antisense gene (Antisense); SO-IPAC, IPAC that is far from all nearby genes (Sense-Orphan). To determine an appropriate distance for SE-IPACs, we first calculated the number of IPACs and random background positions at increasing distance from the nearest annotated stop codon by intervals of 20nt (Fig.3a). The overall distributions of IPACs and background positions differ dramatically in the first 500 to 700 nts where the position at which IPACs disappearing over background becomes apparent. To identify this position more precisely, we computed the ratio of background positions to the total number of positions at a given distance as the false discovery rate (FDR). When the distance to the stop codon is 700nt, the number of background positions within the 700nt region is 1528 (FDR=0.092); the number of IPACs is 10060. It is apparent from Fig.3a that the distribution of IPACs becomes flatter at 700nt past the stop codon. Therefore, given a FDR<0.1 (0.092), 10060 IPACs are considered to be associated with events of 3-UTR extension. These IPACs are classified as SE-IPAC (Sense Extension; Fig.2). This result suggests that SE-IPACs may extend to 700nt past the stop codon, which is considerably longer than the annotated 3-UTR size [7]. It should be noted that the curves in Fig.3a are shown in a log scale and the actual number of sites beyond 700nt is very small relative to sites in the 0-700nt range. In contrast, the extended 700bp length in Arabidopsis is dramatically lower than the corresponding value observed from vertebrates (~9-12kb) [20], which probably due to the more compact genome of Arabidopsis. For instance, the average size of human 3-UTRs is ~1000nt [20], while Arabidopsis only has a mean 3-UTR size of 218nt according to TAIR 10 annotation.Fig. 3Distributions of distances from IPACs to neighboring sense and antisense genes using background distributions as baselines. Distances from IPACs or background nucleotide positions to 5 sense gene (a), 3 sense genes (b), 5 antisense genes (c), and 3 antisense genes (d). The curves in (a) are shown on a log scale. There are 4051 IPACs classified as antisense IPACs (A-IPAC) which may be from the transcripts of the antisense genes [7]. To further remove possible internally primed artifacts from poly(A)-tag sequencing, 1094 poly(A) sites with A/G rich in the downstream 20nt were discarded. Although some genuine poly(A) sites might be removed from this step, we preferred a conserved estimation using the curated A-IPACs. Additional analyses of these A-IPACs are carried out in the next section. Excluding SE-IPACs and A-IPACs, there are 6053 IPACs located at 700nt or more beyond the upstream stop codon. Distances from these IPACs to their nearby genes were then calculated for further characterization. The distributions of distances from IPACs to 3 sense genes or 5 antisense genes resemble the background curves (Fig.3b and c; note that the scale is different from Fig.3a). In contrast, distribution of IPACs to 3 antisense genes shows considerably different from the background (Fig.3d). Thus, for further characterization of this special group, these IPACs are defined as SO-IPACs, excluding those close to their 3 antisense genes or 3 sense genes (<700nt). The three classes of IPACs are listed in Fig.4. The majority (70%) of IPACs belong to the SE-IPAC group, suggesting that most IPACs may be associated with 3-UTR extension.Fig. 4Statistics of three categories of IPACs. . . Characteristics of different classes of IPACs. . General sequence characteristics of IPACs. To gain further insight into IPACs of different classes, the relative base composition of the sequences surrounding IPACs was studied. Such analyses have been thought to be an effective way to identify important sequence trends and probable poly(A) signals [7, 12, 27]. Results show that base compositions surrounding SE-IPACs and SO-IPACs are similar (Fig.5a and b) but with less A/T difference in the NUE (near upstream element) region of SO-IPACs. This difference probably reflects distinct poly(A) signals used in different classes of IPACs. Particularly, the profile of SE-IPACs is indistinguishable from that of 3-UTRs PACs [7, 27], reflecting that these SE-IPACs are very probably associated with known 3-UTRs. These SE-IPACs that possess the general poly(A) signals may derive from genuine alternative polyadenylation, unannotated genes, or transposons [25]. In contrast, the profile of A-IPACs seems to be different (Fig.5c). There is little preference for T across the whole profile, but there is an increased occurrence of A throughout the entire region. We further divided A-IPACs into four groups according to their antisense regions and found that A-IPACs with different antisense regions show distinct profiles (Additional file 1: Figure S4). Therefore, the different profile of A-IPACs from that of SE-IPACs or SO-IPACs probably because that A-IPACs are located in the antisense parts of annotated genes, sharing the same nucleotide base compositions as their complementary parts.Fig. 5Position-by-position base composition of IPACs in different classes. (a) SE-IPAC; (b) SO-IPAC; (c) A-IPAC. We then examined the frequency of the use of poly(A) signal hexamers for different classes of IPACs. Poly(A) signal hexamers can be classified into three types: AATAAA, 1nt variants of AATAAA (1nt-variants), and no poly(A) signal (noPAS) (Additional file 1: Figure S5). As demonstrated in many genetic assays, the most dominant poly(A) signal for promoting polyadenylation in plants is AATAAA. Approximately 7% and 34% of SE-IPACs and SO-IPACs have AATAAA and its variants, which resembles the observation from 3-UTR PACs. This reflects that SE-IPACs and SO-IPACs may share similar poly(A) signals with 3-UTR PACs [27]. In contrast, A-IPACs are associated with weaker (or different) signals than other groups of IPACs. There are only 3% and 23% of AATAAA and 1nt variants for A-IPACs, which are much lower than other classes. Thus, the strength of poly(A) signal of A-IPACs is different from other types of IPACs, suggesting distinct mechanisms in the use of these signals.. Our next objective was to obtain a measure of the accuracy of these IPACs. Such a measure would be useful in the selection of the most promising candidates for experimental validation of novel 3-UTRs or intergenic transcripts. We adopted the poly(A) site prediction tool for Arabidopsis called PASS [28] to predict IPACs. First, the sequence of upstream 300nt and downstream 100nt of each IPAC was trimmed. Given a sequence, the output of PASS is a series of scores of each position of this sequence. The bigger a score is, the higher probability of this position being a real poly(A) site. Using the default parameters of PASS, we calculated the scores for all IPACs. Moreover, randomly selected 2000 3-UTR PACs and background positions were used as controls. The output scores for each position of the 400nt sequences of each group were averaged. As can be seen from Additional file 1: Figure S6, the score profiles of IPACs and 3-UTR PACs are highly distinguishable from that of background positions. We observed a local peak in the position of poly(A) site (300nt) with a sharp decline around the 3-UTR PACs or IPACs, suggesting that these IPACs share similar sequence characteristics with 3-UTR PACs.. . . . 3-extensions of gene space from SE-IPACs. The majority of IPACs are in the case of SE-IPAC. A total of 6984 genes have 10060 SE-IPACs in their extended 3-UTR regions. These genes play roles in functions like phosphorylation and cell recognition (Additional file 2: Table S1), which is suggestive of distinctive modes of actions and functions for SE-IPACs. 2762 SE-IPACs were supported by RNA-seq data, which were located within 200nt of genes identified by Tophat/Cufflinks pipeline. Of the 6984 genes, there are 2035 genes that do not have any 3-UTR PAC but have SE-IPACs in their extended downstream regions. There are 3255 genes that have more than two PACs in their 3-UTRs, and 2913 extended 3-UTR regions have more than two SE-IPACs. A previous study [9] discovered 165 coding genes with newly annotated 3 UTRs and 429 genes with 3 UTR elongation more than 50nt (as the 3 UTR was extended 50nt in our study), 135 (82%) and 335 (78%) of these genes also possess SE-IPACs, reflecting the authenticity of the SE-IPACs discovered in this study. These SE-IPACs could be a valuable addition to the improvement of the Arabidopsis genome annotation. Considering these SE-IPACs as additional 3-UTR PACs, there are up to 38,242 PACs in the 3-UTRs covering 17,575 genes. These SE-IPACs supply poly(A) sites for 2736 genes that were without an annotated poly(A) site in TAIR10 (SE-IPAC lists are provided in Additional file 3).. To assess the changes in 3-UTR lengths after recruiting SE-IPACs as 3-UTR PACs, we calculated 3-UTR lengths using original 3-UTR PACs and the expanded ones. As shown in Fig.6a, the length of 3-UTR after extending is significantly longer than before extending (Wilcoxon test, P value=9.39e-178). The median length of extended 3-UTRs is 188nt, which is 19nt longer than the original 3-UTR length (169nt; using all 3-UTR PACs). The difference of the mean length is even larger. The mean length of extended 3-UTRs is 217nt, which is 34nt longer than the original 3-UTR length (183nt; using all 3-UTR PACs).Fig. 6Changes in 3-UTR lengths after including SE-IPACs. (a) Changes in 3-UTR lengths using all genes with PACs; median lengths are 188nt and 169nt. (b) Change of median 3-UTR lengths in function of the number of PACs after extending. Genes with one, two, and three PACs were selected to calculate the 3-UTR length of each individual PAC. The histogram 3PACs uses genes with 3 PACs and shows the median 3-UTR length of the first (blue), second (red), and third PAC (green), respectively. The dashed box denotes the 3-UTR length before extending. The solid box denotes the 3-UTR length after extending. Numbers denote the 3-UTR lengths before and after extending. We next assessed the change of 3-UTR length as a function of the number of observed 3-UTR PACs (Fig.6b). In genes with three PACs after extending, the average 3-UTR lengths of the first, second, and third PACs are 130, 207, and 305nt, respectively. It is suggested that multiple PACs on the 3-UTR are interspersed on average every 80 to 100nt. These lengths after extending are 13nt, 21nt, and 54nt longer than those before extending. For genes with two PACs, the 3-UTR lengths after extending are 15nt and 35nt longer than those before extending. For genes with single PAC, the 3-UTR length after extending is 24nt longer than that before extending. This result also suggests that the 3-UTR length of distal PACs tends to be lengthened to a larger extent than that of proximal ones.. . . Potential novel transcripts from SO-IPACs. There are 1317 SO-IPACs which are located far from nearby genes (Fig.4). These SO-IPACs are probably from novel transcripts. Compared to SE-IPACs, there are a lot less SO-IPACs, which may be due to that the genome annotation of Arabidopsis is quite complete and there are not many novel genes to be discovered. To validate these SO-IPACs, we employed five public RNA-seq datasets [29-33]. Novel genes not annotated in TAIR10 genome annotation were discovered from these RNA-seq datasets using the Tophat/Cufflinks pipeline [34]. Total 161 SO-IPACs were located within novel genes identified from RNA-seq data. If a 200nt margin is allowed for comparison, 196 SO-IPACs were validated. How many uncharacterized genes may be originated from these SO-IPACs? An upper boundary for the number of transcripts detected in our analyses would be the 1317 identified SO-IPACs from unannotated intergenic regions. This is likely to be an overestimate, as multiple PACs may be derived from the same gene because of alternative polyadenylation. An estimation that includes this possibility may be obtained by evaluating the relative distance of PACs within the annotated genes and considering clusters of nearby IPACs derived from the same gene. Here we estimated a more likely number of potential novel genes. Previous studies have shown that APA is widespread in various species [2, 7, 35-37], we first estimated the distance of two PACs within 3-UTR. Only 3-UTR is used because the majority of PACs are in this region. The average length of 3-UTR region after extending is 935nt. The average number of PACs in the extended 3-UTRs is 2.17. Therefore, the estimated average distance between two PACs in a gene is 431nt. This distance is used to cluster SO-IPACs to estimate the number of potential genes. 592 out of 1317 SO-IPACs are located within a distance of 2000nt of their nearby genes based on TAIR 10 annotation. At this distance, it is unlikely that a complete gene is inserted between IPAC and the upstream annotated gene, as Arabidopsis protein coding genes are on average 2343nt long and separated by 5086nt according to TAIR10 annotation. Even if exceptions are possible, we consider these IPACs to be pertaining to the nearest annotated genes, or false positives. This step removed some genuine orphan sense IPACs, but we preferred this conservative approach to focus on IPACs of high confidence. The remaining 725 IPACs located 2000nt past their nearby genes were selected for further estimation of the potential novel genes. After clustering, there are 598 clusters, and the maximum number of SO-IPACs within a cluster is 8. Next, we used ESTs or RNA-seq data to verify these clusters. If the dominant IPAC in a cluster is located within the 500nt of a given EST or within 200nt of the novel genes discovered from RNA-seq, then it is considered as a of a potential transcript. Using this approach, 127 and 171 clusters can be verified by RNA-seq data and ESTs, respectively. Therefore, one would obtain 127 to 171 potential novel genes from these SO-IPACs as a lower boundary. These clusters contain 136 to 220 IPACs; the maximum number of IPACs in a cluster is three.. What is the coding potential of the novel genes associated with SO-IPACs? First we estimated the possible protein coding regions from these SO-IPACs. The average length of 3-UTR from all PACs in 3-UTRs is 200nt. We trimmed upstream 500nt to 200nt region from each SO-IPAC to estimate the coding potential. Using the coding-potential calculator (CPC) [38] to calculate the coding potential of these 300nt sequences, 37 SO-IPACs were considered as coding. We also utilized 6545 ITFs from previous study [24] to assess whether these SO-IPACs are transcribed or not. 259 (20%) SO-IPACs are located within 100nt of the ITFs, suggesting the transcription possibility of these IPACs. However, the relatively low percentage of IPACs overlapping with ITFs may be due to that most ITFs are significantly shorter and expressed at significantly lower levels [24] and thus cannot be detected by our sequencing data. Together, these results indicate that a small fraction (less than 20%) of these SO-IPACs may be associated with protein coding genes, reflecting that the majority of them may be resulted from noncoding transcripts. The previous study [9] identified 132 snoRNAs (small nucleolar RNAs) that are located in intergenic regions defined in our study, 19 of them possess IPACs from this study, indicating that a small part of IPACs may be associated with non-coding RNAs. Next, we further used plant long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) [39] to search possible ncRNAs that embed SO-IPACs. Total 350 SO-IPACs could be mapped to 239 lncRNAs. The majority of these lncRNAs (164 from 239) possess only one SO-IPAC (Fig.7a). 31% of lncRNAs have more than one SO-IPAC, whereas the APA extent in animals is up to 66% [37]. The single nucleotide composition profile of these SO-IPACs resembles that of all SO-IPACs (Fig.7b vs. Fig.5b), indicating that no different sequence characteristics may be used by PACs in lncRNA.Fig. 7SO-IPACs associated with lncRNAs. (a) Statistics of lncRNA genes with different number of SO-IPACs; (b) single nucleotide compositions of SO-PACs located in lncRNAs. The previous study [40] predicted more than 33,000 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding peptides in Arabidopsis using a bioinformatics approach, 1044 of which were supported by several kinds of annotation data such as tiling hybridization experiments. As small genes encoding peptides are often overlooked in genome annotations [41], it raises the possibility that SO-IPACs may be associated with genes with small size. To test this possibility, we scanned the upstream regions of SO-IPACs for previously identified small ORFs with predicted small signal peptides (SSP) [40]. From the 1317 SO-IPACs, 651 (49%) of them were located within 2000nt downstream of small ORFs (the list of SO-IPACs associated with small ORFs is provided in Additional file 3). Up to 406 SO-IPACs can be associated with small ORFs that validated by at least one of the following five evidences, including the tiling experiments, the massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) dataset, the plant protein database, the orthologs in rice, and the single-linkage clustering. 103 SO-IPACs are associated with small ORFs that can be validated by at least two of the five evidences. As the poly(A) site marks the end of a gene, the presence of a poly(A) site might be considered as an evidence for the identification of small ORFs or SSPs.. . . A-IPACs may be associated with antisense transcription. There are 21% (2957) A-IPACs whose antisense strand is not intergenic (Fig.4). These IPACs may be originated from antisense transcripts. 1073 IPACs were supported by RNA-seq data, which were located within 200nt of genes identified from RNA-seq data. 18% of A-IPACs (539) are in the 3-UTR region of its antisense gene. Interestingly, 44% of them are from CDS, 15% are from introns (Fig.8). Majority of the antisense genes (91%) of these A-IPACs are protein coding genes. These A-IPACs affect 2265 protein coding genes as well as 39 genes that are not protein coding; the latter include genes that encode 15 transposable element genes, 12 ncRNA, 8 pseudogenes, 3 miRNA, and 1 rRNA. Some interesting trends are apparent in the Gene Ontology analysis of these antisense genes (Additional file 2: Table S2). These genes involve in functions like response to abiotic stimulus, associated with hormonal responses and growth regulations, suggesting important roles for those genes with A-IPACs.Fig. 8Distribution of A-IPACs whose antisense is not intergenic. Antisense transcription may affect gene expression in both negative and positive strands [42]. We then inspected the expression levels of the A-IPACs and their respective targets to provide possible mechanisms of gene expression regulation. The number of PATs of the A-IPACs and the total number of PATs of their target genes were used as expression level analysis. There is a relatively low but significant correlation between the expression levels of A-IPACs and their targets (Pearsons correlation=0.11, P value=1.977e-06). This result indicates that antisense transcription may serve to regulate the expression of target genes.. . . Intergenic poly(A) sites in oxt6 mutant. To examine whether the characteristic of intergenic poly(A) sites in other mutant is similar to that in WT, we studied the intergenic poly(A) sites in a mutant (oxt6) deficient in CPSF30 (30-kD subunit of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Stimulatory Factor) expression [12]. Using the same strategy of classification of IPACs in WT, 9281 SE-IPACs, 1071 A-IPACs, and 1156 SO-IPACs were found in oxt6 mutant (Additional file 1: Figure S7A). As expected, majority of the IPACs are SE-IPACs, while the number of A-IPACs in oxt6 mutant is much lower than that of WT (Additional file 1: Figure s4). The relative base composition of the sequences surrounding SE-IPACs is similar to that of SO-IPACs (Additional file 1: Figures S7B and C), both of which are indistinguishable from that of 3-UTRs PACs in oxt6 mutant [12]. Again, this result reflects that SE-IPACs or SO-IPACs are very likely associated with known 3-UTRs. In contrast, the profile of A-IPACs is slightly different from that of other IPACs (Additional file 1: Figure S7D), which is also observed in WT.. Next, we examined whether there is a large-scale shift of IPAC usage between oxt6 mutant and WT. Up to 5283 (46%) from the 11,508 IPACs in oxt6 mutant are located within 50nt of IPACs in WT, indicating that about half of poly(A) sites in intergenic regions are shared by both WT and oxt6 mutant. The percentage of common IPACs between oxt6 mutant and WT is lower than that of 3-UTR PACs (74%) [12] while higher than that of CDS or intron PACs (25%), which may due to that IPACs could be originated from any genomic regions. In addition, there is a relative high and statistically significant correlation of the read counts of common IPACs between oxt6 mutant and WT (Pearson correlation=0.44, P value=0), indicating that poly(A) site usage of common IPACs are unlikely altered in oxt6 mutant. However, up to 54% of IPACs in oxt6 mutant are not present in WT, reflecting that a number of IPACs are specific for either the WT or mutant. Similar to the observation of IPACs, 3-UTR poly(A) site choice in a large majority of Arabidopsis genes is also altered in oxt6 mutant [12]..
PMC3245481	Results. . GRXS13.2 is the variant that contributes most to the transcriptional activity of the GRXS13 gene. GRXS13 (At1g03850) codes for two 85.5% identical protein isoforms: GRXS13.1 and GRXS13.2 that belong to the group of CC-type GRXs from Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online) (Rouhier et al., 2004). Alignment of amino acid sequences for the GRXS13 variants and the other previously characterized CC-type GRXs from Arabidopsis (GRXC9, ROXY1, and ROXY2) is shown in Fig. 1A. The closest CC-type GRX that clusters together with the GRXS13 isoforms is GRXC9 (encoded by At1g28480), that shows 42% and 47% identity with GRXS13.1 and GRXS13.2, respectively (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). GRXS13 isoforms are coded by two transcript variants (Fig. 1B) and share their amino acid sequences from the N-terminus up to position 136 (Fig. 1A, arrowhead). This region contains most of the characteristic GRX motifs (amino acids 53-149; http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q84TF4) including the predicted CCLG active site (Fig. 1A, B). These isoforms differ in their C-terminal end; while GRXS13.1 contains a unique 23 amino acid sequence that has no homology with other GRXs, GRXS13.2 has a 14 amino acid sequence that contains the conserved GAL/IWL motif (Fig. 1A, B). This motif was proven to be essential for ROXY1 protein function and is conserved among the CC-type GRXs-including GRXS13.2-that complement ROXY1 function in the roxy1-2 Arabidopsis mutant (Li et al., 2009) (Fig. 1A). The sequence conservation and functional complementation suggest that GRXS13.2 is the predominant isoform. Supporting this hypothesis, analyses of the full-length (FL) cDNAs and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) found for the GRXS13 gene in the Arabidopsis database (TAIR, www.arabidopsis.org) indicate that 87% of the transcripts correspond to the GRXS13.2 variant, while the rest correspond to the GRXS13.1 variant (Supplementary Table S2).. . Fig. 1.. . The GRXS13 gene codes for two CC-type GRX isoforms, GRXS13.2 being the predominantly expressed isoform in Arabidopsis seedlings. (A) Multiple sequence alignment of amino acid sequences for GRXS13 isoforms and the three previously characterized CC-type GRXs from Arabidopsis (GRXC9, ROXY1, and ROXY2). The glutaredoxin domain (amino acids 53-149; http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q84TF4) is indicated by the line drawn above the sequences; the CCLG active site and the GALWL motif are indicated by asterisks (*); GRXS13.1 and GRXS13.2 are identical up to residue 136 (arrowhead). Black boxes are used to indicate amino acid identity, while grey boxes indicate amino acid similarity. (B) Transcript processing of GRXS13 gene variants. The 23 amino acid C-terminus of GRXS13.1 is encoded by the second exon, while the 14 amino acid C-terminus of GRXS13.2 is encoded by part of the gene intron. (C) Expression pattern of GRXS13 gene variants in Arabidopsis seedlings (15d old), in leaves, stems, roots, and flowers from adult plants (5 weeks old), and in seeds. GRXS13.1 and GRXS13.2 transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR and normalized by clathrin transcript levels. Data are presented as normalized transcript levels and correspond to mean values SD from three biological replicas.. . . . To evaluate whether GRXS13.2 is the predominant variant expressed in Arabidopsis tissues, the basal normalized levels of transcripts for both variants were compared using qRT-PCR. The results confirmed that GRXS13.2 is the variant predominantly expressed under basal conditions in all tissues. The levels of GRXS13.2 transcript in these tissues were 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than those of GRXS13.1 (Fig. 1C). The tissues displaying the highest accumulation of GRXS13.2 transcript were seedlings, roots, and seeds (Fig. 1C).. As shown below, GRXS13.2 was responsive to stress treatments while the GRXS13.1 variant was not (Fig. 2). Taking together the experimental results, the relative abundance in FL cDNA and ESTs databases (Supplementary Table S2), and the ability of GRXS13.2 to complement ROXY1 function, it can be argued that GRXS13.2 is the variant that predominantly contributes to the transcriptional activity of the GRXS13 gene.. . Fig. 2.. . The GRXS13.2 gene variant is induced by methyl viologen (MeV) and high light (HL) stress treatments. Transcript levels for GRXS13.1 and GRXS13.2 (A, B) and GST-1 (C, D) were measured using qRT-PCR in 15-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings at different times (in hours) after treatments (black bars) with 50muM MeV (A, C) or with HL (1000mumol m-2 s-1) (B, D). Control treatments were performed in MS medium (white bars). Transcript levels of GRXS13.1 and GRXS13.2 variants were normalized by comparison with a reference gene, and the extent of gene induction was calculated with regard to the basal level (time 0) for the corresponding variant. Clathrin was used to normalize GRXS13.1 and GRXS13.2 expression, while UBQ10 was used to normalize GST-1 expression. Data corresponds to mean values SD from three biological replicas. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Mann-Whitney test with the GraphPad Prism 5 program. Values showing statistically significant differences relative to the corresponding WT samples are indicated by asterisks (*P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001).. . . . . . The GRXS13.2 gene variant is induced by MeV and HL treatments. To determine whether GRXS13 gene variants are responsive to oxidative stress, Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with 50muM MeV (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridylium chloride) in the presence of light (100mumol m-2 s-1), or with HL (1000mumol m-2 s-1). Both treatments are known to produce photooxidative stress characterized by increased production of superoxide at the photosystem I (PSI) complex. Transcript levels of GRXS13.1 and GRXS13.2 variants were normalized by comparison with a reference gene, and the extent of gene induction was calculated with regard to the basal level (time 0) for the corresponding variant. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, these treatments produced an increase in GRXS13.2 mRNA levels, which reached statistical significance after 12h of treatment. In contrast, the GRXS13.1 variant was not responsive to these stress treatments (Fig. 2A, B). GST1, a marker gene for oxidative stress (Rentel and Knight, 2004), was used as a positive control to verify that treatments were effective (Fig. 2C, D). These results indicate that the GRXS13.2 variant is responsive to photooxidative stress and support evidence that indicates that this is the main transcriptional active variant of GRXS13.. . . GRXS13 gene knock down reduces plant growth and increases basal production of superoxide radicals. To carry out a gain-loss functional analysis for the GRXS13.2 gene variant, homozygous Arabidopsis lines that either knock down the GRXS13 gene (Sil lines expressing the 35S::GRXS13-RNAi construct) or overexpress the GRXS13.2 variant (OE lines expressing 35S::GRXS13.2-Myc construct) were generated.. The efficacy of the knocking down of GRXS13.2 gene expression was assessed in the three characterized Sil lines (named 6.1, 13.4, and 18.3) by measuring GRXS13.2 transcript levels in response to MeV. As shown in Fig. 3A, Sil lines showed reduced levels of GRXS13.2 transcript. Basal and MeV-induced levels of this transcript ranged between 13-61% and 7-30%, respectively, of those detected in WT plants (Fig. 3A). To confirm the specificity of the silencing, the activity of GRXC9, the nearest GRX gene that shares 46% sequence identity with the GRXS13 gene in the fragment used for the RNAi (RNA interference) harpin was measured. Because the GRXC9 gene has been described as a salicylic acid (SA)-responsive gene (Ndamukong et al., 2007; Blanco et al., 2009), its activation by SA was studied in the GRXS13-silenced lines. As shown in Fig. 3B, this gene was not silenced in any of the three Sil lines, confirming the specificity of the knocking down procedure.. . Fig. 3.. . Characterization of Arabidopsis transgenic lines silencing (Sil) and overexpressing (OE) the GRXS13 gene. Homozygous 35S::GRXS13-RNAi lines (Sil lines 6.1, 13.4, and 18.3) and 35S::GRXS13.2-Myc lines (OE lines 5.2 and 5.3) were obtained using the Gateway cloning technology and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transcript levels of GRXS13.2 (A) and GRXC9 (B) were determined by qRT-PCR in WT (white bars), Sil lines (grey bars), and OE lines (black bars), treated or not with methyl viologen (+/- MeV, 50muM) for 12h (A) or salicylic acid (+/- SA, 0.5mM) for 2.5h (B). Expression data are indicated as relative levels with respect to the basal level in WT plants and represent mean values SD from three biological replicas. Data were analysed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. Values showing statistically significant differences relative to the corresponding WT samples are indicated by asterisks (*P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001). (C) Immunoblot for GRXS13.2-Myc protein detection in OE lines. A 30mug aliquot of total protein extracts from WT (Col-0) and two transgenic OE lines (5.2 and 5.3) was loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a membrane, and the GRXS13.2-Myc protein was detected with a commercial monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody (Invitrogen) (upper panel, arrowhead). Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (lower panel) indicates that equivalent amounts of proteins were loaded.. . . . Two 35S::GRXS13.2-Myc lines that overexpress a C-terminally myc-tagged GRXS13.2 protein (OE lines 5.2 and 5.3) were also characterized. These OE lines show high basal levels of GRXS13.2 transcripts: 4- and 1.8-fold higher compared with those found in MeV-treated WT plants (Fig. 3A). Increased transcript levels correlated with overexpression of the Myc-tagged GRXS13.2 protein, as detected by immunoblot with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3C).. Using the Sil and OE lines, the aim was to determine whether alterations in GRXS13 gene expression produced any effect on plant growth. Six weeks after germination in soil under short-day conditions, the plants obtained from Sil lines showed reduced growth compared with the WT, as determined by fresh weight quantification (Fig. 4A, B). This phenotype is not evidenced under long-day conditions. In contrast, OE plants did not show any significant difference in growth compared with the WT, under either short-day or long-day conditions (Fig. 4A, B).. . Fig. 4.. . Effect of knocking down and overexpressing the GRXS13 gene on plant growth and superoxide radical basal levels. (A and B) GRXS13 gene knock down reduced plant growth. Plant biomass (determined by fresh weight) was measured in 6-week-old plants from WT (Col-0, white bar), Sil lines (grey bars), and OE lines (black bars) grown under short-day conditions (8h light). Data represent mean values SD from five biological replicas. (C) GRXS13 gene knock down increased basal levels of superoxide ion. In vivo levels of superoxide radical were determined in 15-day-old seedlings from WT (white bar), Sil lines, (grey bars), and OE lines (black bars), through the oxidized fluorescent probe 2-hydroxy ethidium (2OH-E). Data represent mean values SD from four biological replicas. Data were analysed by the paired Mann-Whitney test using the GraphPad Prism 5 program. Values showing statistically significant differences relative to the corresponding WT samples are indicated by asterisks (*P <0.05 and **P < 0.01).. . . . To evaluate whether GRXS13 plays a role in the basal capacity of plants to detoxify ROS, in vivo levels of superoxide radicals were determined in WT, Sil, and OE lines using the fluorescent probe DHE (Georgiou et al., 2005). Interestingly, the three Sil lines showed higher levels of superoxide radicals compared with the WT (Figs 4C, 6C). In contrast, the OE line 5.2 had a significantly lower basal level of superoxide compared with the WT (Figs 4C, 6C). This line displayed the highest GRXS13.2 expression (Fig. 3A).. . Fig. 5.. . Effect of knocking down and overexpressing GRXS13.2 on the tolerance to methyl viologen (MeV) treatment. (A) Silencing of the GRXS13 gene reduced the ability of Arabidopsis plants to survive in the presence of MeV. Seeds from WT (white bars), Sil lines (grey bars), and OE lines (black bars) were germinated on MS medium alone (C) or supplemented with 0.25muM MeV (T) under controlled conditions (16h light, 100mumol m-2 s-1, 222C). At day 4, seedlings were scored for survival rates (percentage of green seedlings with respect to the total germinated seedlings); these scores were compared with the corresponding values of untreated WT seedlings (100%). Data represent mean values SD from six biological replicas. (B and C) Overexpressing GRXS13.2 reduces necrotic symptoms after MeV treatment. Analysis of necrotic symptoms that developed in leaves of 5-week-old plants of WT (white bars), Sil lines (grey bars), and OE lines (black bars) after 2d of MeV treatment (a 2mul drop of a 15muM MeV solution). Representative examples of symptoms which developed after MeV treatments are shown in (B). According to the extension of the leaf necrotic area, lesions were scored in a three-point scale I, II, and III, as described in the Materials and methods. (C) The percentage of leaves showing each of the symptoms at day 2 after MeV treatment was scored. Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test with the GraphPad Prism 5 program. Values that show statistically significant differences relative to the corresponding WT samples are indicated by an asterisk (P < 0.05).. . . . . Fig. 6.. . Effect of knocking down and overexpressing GRXS13.2 on oxidative damage, levels of superoxide radicals, and ASC/DHA after HL stress. Arabidopsis seedlings (15d old) from WT, Sil, and OE lines were treated under HL (T, 1000mumol m-2 s-1) or under control conditions (C, 100mumol m-2 s-1) for the indicated periods of time. (A) A time course for the oxidative damage of membranes, evidenced by ion leakage measurements, is shown for WT (dotted black lines), Sil lines (grey lines), and OE lines (black lines). Control treatment for WT plants only is shown (black squares); Sil and OE lines behaved similarly to the WT. Lines for both OE lines are superimposed. Data represent mean values SD from four biological replicas. (B and C) The superoxide radical levels (B) and the ASC/DHA ratios (C) were determined in WT (white bar), Sil lines (grey bars), and OE lines (black bars) under control conditions (C) and after 12h of treatment with HL stress (T). Data represent mean values SD from four biological replicas. Statistical analysis was performed using paired Mann-Whitney test with the GraphPad Prism 5 program. Values that show statistically significant differences compared with the corresponding WT samples are indicated by asterisks (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001).. . . . The fact that knocking down GRXS13 inhibits plant growth and is associated with increased levels of superoxide radicals suggests that GRXS13 expression is required for normal superoxide detoxification under basal conditions.. . . The GRXS13 gene plays a role in protection against photooxidative stress. Given the fact that GRXS13.2 is a photooxidative stress-responsive gene required for basal superoxide detoxification, it was hypothesized that its induction is essential for Arabidopsis plants tolerance to this type of stress. To assess the role of GRXS13 in the tolerance of plants to MeV treatment, the effect of silencing and overexpressing the gene on seedling survival in a medium supplemented with 0.25muM MeV was studied. For this purpose, seeds were germinated in this medium and 15d later the survival rate (percentage of green seedlings with respect to the total germinated seedlings) was calculated. As shown in Fig. 5A (white bars), WT plants showed 82% reduction in survival rate. Interestingly, Sil lines showed a higher reduction in survival (95-97%) after MeV exposure (Fig. 5A, grey bars). OE lines did not show significant differences in survival compared with the WT (Fig. 5A, black bars). The development of tolerance to MeV was also assessed in WT, Sil, and OE lines, by evaluating the development of necrotic lesions in leaves whose surface was exposed to 2mul of a 15muM MeV solution. After 2d of exposure to MeV, lesions were scored according to the extension of the necrotic area. They were classified as type I, II, and III (Fig. 5B, see the Materials and methods) (de Leon et al., 2002). No differences in the severity of lesions between WT and Sil plants were detected. In contrast, OE plants had significantly fewer type III lesions compared with the WT (Fig. 5C). In sum, these results indicate that GRXS13 plays a role in tolerance to photooxidative stress produced by MeV.. To assess whether GRXS13 plays a role in protecting plants against HL stress, the oxidative membrane damage in Arabidopsis seedlings from WT, Sil, and OE lines treated with HL (1000mumol m-2 s-1) was assessed. In WT plants, HL treatment produced a significant increase in ion leakage reaching up to 27% of basal levels after 12h of treatment (dotted lines in Fig. 6A). Compared with the WT, Sil lines showed a higher increase in ion leakage that reached between 43% and 51% the basal level after 12h of HL treatment (grey lines in Fig. 6A). In contrast, OE lines showed significantly less ion leakage than the WT (17-18%) after 12h of treatment (black lines in Fig. 6A). As a control treatment plants were exposed to 100mumol m-2 s-1 light intensity; this treatment produced a small increase in ion leakage (6-9%) after 12h of treatment in all lines (Fig. 6A).. Considering the effect of GRXS13.2 expression on the basal levels of superoxide radical (Fig. 4C), the levels of this radical were then measured in WT, Sil, and OE lines subjected to HL stress conditions. As shown in Fig. 6B, after 12h HL treatment the three Sil lines showed higher levels of superoxide than WT plants. On the other hand, only one of the overexpressor lines (OE line 5.2) displayed reduced levels of superoxide compared with WT plants (Fig. 6B). It was then investigated whether changes in ROS levels correlated with alterations in the levels and redox state of ASC. The ASC/DHA ratio did not differ between WT and Sil plants. In contrast, in OE lines, the ASC/DHA ratio was significantly higher than in WT plants (Fig. 6C). The total levels of ASC+DHA were not significantly different between transgenic lines and WT plants (data not shown).. Taken together, these results indicate that expression of the GRXS13.2 gene variant is required to limit ROS accumulation and therefore to protect tissues from damage induced by photooxidative stress treatments..
PMC3237594	Results. . Assessment of the re-establishment of desiccation tolerance. Previous reports have shown that DT can be fully rescued in germinated seeds [10], [14], [16]. Here it was tested whether DT could be re-induced in Arabidopsis seeds by treating them in a PEG (-2.5 MPa) solution for three days at 22C. DT can be re-induced in imbibed seeds only in a limited time frame and its loss usually coincides, depending on the species, with the protrusion of the radicle tip and/or radicle length [10], [14], [16]. Therefore we defined four clearly distinct developmental stages to assess for re-induction of DT. The stages are: stage I (testa rupture), stage II (seeds at radical protrusion), stage III (germinated seeds showing a primary root of 0.3-0.5 mm length) and stage IV (at the appearance of the first root hairs) (Figure 1). First we determined the best developmental stage suitable for the re-establishment of DT. For all stages DT could be re-established to a certain extent however seeds at earlier stages (i.e. stages I and II) performed better as compared to the two later stages. Seeds completing germination at stage I and germinated at stage II, showed 100% of re-establishment of DT regarding primary roots, cotyledons and seedling formation while for those at stage III a slight reduction in all parameters was observed (Figure 2). Germinated seeds at stage IV showed low competence in re-establishing DT with a final survival rate of 38% (Figure 2). This treatment pointed to a developmental stage-dependent re-establishment of DT and, in addition, indicates that different seed parts have differential sensitivity to drying. Interestingly, more seedlings survived due to lateral root formation. This phenomenon was also observed by several other authors. They frequently noted the appearance of lateral roots after the primary root had been lethally damaged by desiccation [14], [16], [23]. Seedlings that did not resume radicle growth, frequently showed growth of the cotyledons and, to a lesser extent, also of the hypocotyl. However, the longer the radicle before dehydration, the less frequent the growth of cotyledons and hypocotyl.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0029123.g002. Figure 2. . Re-establishment of desiccation tolerance in Arabidopsis.. Desiccation tolerance was determined after drying the germinated seeds with or without previous PEG treatment, followed by pre-humidification and rehydration. Survival of cotyledons (circles) and primary roots (squares) was scored 5 d after rehydration and seedlings (triangles) 10 d after rehydration. Each data point is the average of four independent experiments of 25 seed/seedlings. Bars represent standard error.. . . . Next we investigated the effect of the osmotic potential and time of incubation on the ability to re-establish DT in germinated Arabidopsis seeds. Therefore, first, seeds at stage II were submitted to different PEG concentrations (Figure 3A). DT could be substantially re-induced (approximately 100%) for all parameters in seeds treated with PEG -2.5 MPa. A lower PEG osmotic potential (-1.7 MPa) re-induced DT as well and resulted in nearly 100% survival of the cotyledons after drying. However, this concentration resulted in a huge drop of primary root survival to approximately 10%. A larger percentage of seedlings survived (60%) although this depended on lateral root formation. From -2.5 MPa downwards there was an abrupt drop in DT re-establishment, decreasing to 34% for cotyledons, 1% for primary roots and 7% for seedling formation at -3.5 MPa, to 0% for all parameters at -5.0 and -7.0 MPa (Figure 3A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0029123.g003. Figure 3. . Osmotic potential and incubation time effects on re-establishment of desiccation tolerance.. (A) PEG osmotic potential effect on DT; (B) -2.5 MPa PEG solution incubation time effect on DT. Survival of cotyledons and primary roots was scored 5 d after rehydration and seedlings 10 d after rehydration. Each data point is the average of four independent experiments of 25 seeds at developmental stage II. Bars represent standard error. Control = germinated seeds dried directly at 32% RH without previous PEG treatment.. . . . Thus a concentration of -2.5 MPa PEG solution is the optimal concentration to re-establish DT of stage II Arabidopsis seeds. Lastly we varied the incubation time from several hours up to three days using stage II seeds in a -2.5 MPa PEG solution. As the acquisition of DT is an active process [24], the incubation time also appeared to be crucial to the recovery of DT. A minimum of three days in -2.5 MPa PEG was necessary for full re-establishment of this attribute in Arabidopsis germinated seeds (Figure 3B).. . . Drying responses. Different dehydration conditions, especially drying rates, can significantly influence the response of desiccation-sensitive plant tissues [25]. Therefore we first studied the de-hydration behaviour of the Arabidopsis seeds at all four defined stages. All developmental stages showed similar behaviour in relation to the drying procedures and achieved water content (WC) levels as low as 0.08 g H2O g-1 dry weight by the end of the first 6 hours of drying (Figure 4A). The drying responses of germinated seeds incubated in PEG -2.5 MPa (optimal treatment, see below) was characterized (Figure 4B). All the developmental stages responded similarly when exposed to PEG and further drying at 32% RH. Despite a small difference in initial WC of seeds in the different stages, with the highest in the most advanced stages, they achieved similar WCs by the end of the PEG incubation (0.5 g H2O g-1 dry weight) and after CaCl2 drying (0.05 g H2O g-1 dry weight) (Figure 4A and B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0029123.g004. Figure 4. . Arabidopsis seed water content changes upon dehydration.. Dehydration at 32% RH (A) and incubation in PEG followed by dehydration at 32% RH (B). Inserts show the first hours of drying in more detail. Bars represent standard error.. . . . . . The Arabidopsis transcriptome in desiccation sensitive and -tolerant germinated seeds. Our next step was to carry out a global microarray analysis to identify the genes whose expression changed in the germinated seeds at stage II after PEG incubation (DT) in comparison with that of the non-treated germinated seeds at the same developmental stage (DS). To catalogue genes whose expression responded to the PEG treatment with confidence a cut-off based filter was applied. Genes were selected if their expression exhibited at least 2-fold enhancement/reduction in expression after three days of incubation in PEG in comparison with the non-treated samples, and if the enhancement/reduction in expression was statistically significant (P-value 0.05) over three independent biological replicates. The array used in this experiment covers 30.509 genes in the Arabidopsis genome and the application of this filter resulted in a list (DT/DS gene set) of 677 genes, of which 263 were up-regulated and 414 were down-regulated (Table S1). These genes exhibited an unclustered distribution across the range of hybridization intensities, which indicates an unbiased representation of gene expression. In order to visualize the overall differentially expressed genes (P-value 0.05), we used the Page-Man/MapMan package (http://MapMan.gabipd.org). This tool allows users to display genomic datasets onto pictographic diagrams to get a global overview of the ontology of the up- and down-regulated genes [26]. We used the seed-specific MapMan pathway, which efficiently captures the most relevant molecular processes in seeds [27]. In DT germinated seeds, up-regulation was found of transcripts encoding for cold and drought stress responsive genes, LEA (Late Embryogenesis Abundant) proteins, seed storage proteins, such as cruciferins and PAP85, enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis, transcription factors, especially those interacting with drought and ethylene responsive elements, and dormancy related proteins (Figure 5 and Table S1). Furthermore, genes encoding for ABA signal transduction elements and ABA biosynthesis were up-regulated, concomitantly with the down-regulation of GA biosynthetic genes such as AtGA3ox2 and GA-responsive genes like AGPs (arabinogalactan proteins) and GASA3. Genes related to carbohydrate breakdown and antioxidant activity were also triggered in the DT germinated seeds (Figure 5). In contrast, a massive repression of genes related to DNA biosynthesis and chromatin structure, energy metabolism and cell wall modification was seen in the DT germinated seeds (Figure 5). Regarding the Energy class, down-regulation occurred particularly for genes related to photosynthesis and the Calvin cycle (Figure 5).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0029123.g005. Figure 5. . Seed MapMan molecular network map.. Log2 ratios are used to express relative transcript levels in germinated Arabidopsis seeds at stage II treated for 3 d in PEG -2.5 MPa versus non-treated seeds in the same developmental stage. Red squares, higher levels in PEG treated seeds; blue squares, higher levels in non-treated seeds. Only ratios with P values lower or equal to 0.05 are displayed.. . . . In order to verify whether our strategy to visualize and filter the gene set was valid, a more detailed analysis was undertaken. We used the over-representation analysis (ORA) tool of GeneTrailExpress [21]. This analysis compares a gene set of interest to the reference set and when considering a certain functional category as a gene ontology (GO) term, it attempts to detect if this category is over-represented or under-represented in the respective gene set. It also estimates how likely this is due to chance [21]. The filtered gene set was split into two subsets, up- and down-regulated, and the program allowed us to determine which GO categories were significantly enriched (P-value 0.05) in the DT/DS up- and down-regulated gene subsets (Figure 6). GO terms describing developmentally related processes such as lipid storage, nutrient reservoir activity and seed maturation together with GO terms describing responses to various abiotic stresses responses such as freezing, water deprivation and cold were among the top-ranked enriched processes in the DT/DS up-regulated gene subset. It is important to stress that the genes were ranked in relation to the observed/expected ratio and GO terms such as the ones related to seed development, embryonic development ending in seed dormancy, post-embryonic development, response to hormone and abiotic stimulus as well as response to stress were represented by a large number of genes in the DT/DS up-regulated gene subset (Figure 6). Furthermore, response to water deprivation and abscisic acid (ABA) stimulus categories were, at the same time, represented by a high number of genes and high-ranked, reinforcing the importance of the hormone ABA to the acquisition of DT. Drought responsive genes such as DREB2A, XERO1, LEA genes and ABA-responsive genes, such as EM1, GEA6, RAB18, LTI65, RD29B, among others, appeared in the DT/DS gene set (Table S1). Interestingly, the RD29B gene, which was highly up-regulated in the DT/DS gene set (Table S1), was not listed in the GO category response to ABA stimulus (Table S2), showing that the power of this analysis can be limited by the GO annotation's accuracy. LTI65 contains two ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) that are required for the dehydration-responsive expression of RD29B as cis-acting elements [28]. On the other hand, all the drought responsive genes that were highly up-regulated in the DT/DS set such as PER1, RAB18, ATDI21 and DREB2A, were retrieved in the GO category response to water deprivation. Analyses of DREB2A has shown that it is possible to increase drought stress tolerance of the transgenic plants overexpressing this gene and revealed that DREB2A regulates the expression of many water stress inducible genes [29], [30]. As expected, GO categories denoting processes related to energy such as response to red light, chlorophyll binding and photosynthesis, as well as GO categories grouping genes related to cell wall breakdown and loosening, metabolism of fatty acids, among other post-germination related processes, were over-represented in the down-regulated DT/DS gene subset. For example, xyloglucan endotransglycosylases/hydrolase (XET) genes, such as MERI5B,XTH9 and TCH4 were down-regulated in the DT/DS gene set (Table S1). This gene family encodes for enzymes that modify a major structural component of the plant cell wall, xyloglucans, and therefore may influence plant growth and development [31].. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0029123.g006. Figure 6. . Over-representation analysis of the differentially expressed genes after PEG treatment.. The gene set analyzed was first filtered through a fold-change and variance cut-off based filter (fold change 2 and P-value 0.05). The bars are listed in relation to the observed/expected genes ratio (high to low).. . . . Furthermore, we compared the gene list after the cut-off filter (DT/DS gene set - Table S1) against a data set obtained in a similar system for Medicago [11] and a significant overlap was found. Among 111 genes that were present in both Arabidopsis and Medicago gene sets, 49 were down- and 48 were up-regulated in both species and 14 displayed opposite response (Figure 7 and Table S3). As in Arabidopsis, genes encoding for antioxidant activity, ABA signalling, seed storage proteins, LEA proteins, drought and ethylene responsive elements and dormancy related traits were up-regulated in the rescued Medicago germinated seeds (Table S3, Figure S1 and Table S4). The most significant overlap in the down-regulated genes occurred for genes related to cell wall and energy metabolism. The genes showing opposite response belonged to a varied range of classes. Based on these results we hypothesized that a controlled reversion from the germination program towards the seed developmental program is taking place during the incubation in PEG and that this transition is necessary for the re-establishment of DT. To verify this, we examined the expression during seed imbibition of the top 50 ranked of both up- and down-regulated genes in the DT/DS set and created a heat map in the Expression Browser of the BAR website [32]. The heat maps clearly corroborated our hypothesis and it appears indeed that the germinating seeds are reverted to a developmental, desiccation tolerant, stage (Figure 8). According to this in silico analysis, genes that were up-regulated in the PEG treated seeds and may be related to the acquisition of DT were down-regulated upon imbibition while genes that were down-regulated in the treated seeds were up-regulated upon imbibition (Figure 8). More details about this analysis can be seen in the supplementary material (Table S5).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0029123.g007. Figure 7. .

The top 50 up- and down-regulated genes in the DT/DS set were tested, in silico, for their expression during seed imbibition (0 to 24 h). The DT/DS up-regulated genes showed up-regulation (red) in dry seeds and down-regulation (blue) during seed imbibition. The DT/DS down-regulated genes showed down regulation (blue) in the dry seed and in early phases of seed imbibition and up-regulation along germination. The values in the legend are log2-transformed ratios.. . . . . . Identification of promoter motifs within up-regulated enriched genes. Information about the promoter region of genes can provide valuable information on how these genes are regulated. Besides that, the presence of similar elements in different genes can suggests common regulatory mechanisms of their expression. An analysis of the differentially up-regulated genes in the DT/DS gene set was performed to identify potential cis-acting promoter elements. In particular, this analysis identified two main transcription factor (TF) site groups overrepresented within the promoters of germinated seeds treated with PEG. The first group consists of 11 enriched motifs containing the core sequence (ACGTG), named ABA-responsive element (ABRE) and the second of 2 enriched motifs containing the drought responsive elements (DRE), core motif (A/GCCGACA). Next to these two groups also a MYC-related, RY element and an Evening element were overrepresented.

PMC2910046	RESULTSGenome-wide computational identification of WG/GW-motif proteins in ArabidopsisThe low level of sequence conservation detected by classical methods of comparison based on dynamic programming algorithms inspired us to look for alternative ways to identify WG/GW-motif proteins encoded by the Arabidopsis genome. Analysis of the domain in previously-discovered WG/GW proteins indicated that, in addition to these residues, the other characteristic is the presence or absence of certain other amino acids (11). Therefore, the most direct approach in designing a strategy for WG/GW protein identification was to use this property and base the method on the amino-acid composition specificity of the domain. The identification procedure developed during this work can be divided into four discrete steps (indicated in Figure 1 by filled boxes). The first phase includes localization of all occurrences of WG/GW motif(s) in the genomic/protein sequence. Secondly, putative domain boundaries are identified using the WG/GW positions as starting points. Thirdly, the final domain score, representing the composition of identified motifs, is calculated and used for filtering out sequences based on statistical criteria. The final step includes a BLAST-based search for putative paralogs, where more conserved parts of the protein(s) can be used to infer sequence relationships.. Figure 1.Schematic representation of the WG/GW protein identification pipeline. Grey-filled boxes represent the four major steps in the identification procedure.Arabidopsis is currently the best annotated plant genome available. However, even now some gene models are not correct and, most probably, some genes still await discovery. Therefore our analysis was simultaneously carried out directly on the genomic sequence as well as on the latest Arabidopsis annotation (TAIR 9.0: http://arabidopsis.org). We took this precaution as the biased amino-acid composition of the WG/GW motifs induces an atypical codon usage. This can lead to mis- or non-identification of WG/GW-coding regions, with the loss in certain cases of complete exons (data not shown) and incorrect annotation of the corresponding genes. At the final stage of the analysis pipeline, both genomic and protein based pools were mapped onto each other and, where possible, annotated genes were identified.A de novo search for new, as yet uncharacterized protein domains, which do not show clear similarity to other sequences presents many challenges, among which one of the most difficult is the assessment of biological significance of the new findings. One solution to this problem is the development of a scoring system which allows clear discrimination between various motifs. Our system is based on the limited number of protein sequences with clear WG/GW domains in proteins identified by PSI-BLAST (15). As only a few such proteins had been identified in Arabidopsis, we included proteins from other plant species-rice, cottonwood, poplar, tomato, grape, corn and spinach in this data set (Supplementary Data) to make the analysis more universal. The resulting scoring table provides information about the preference for a given amino acid to be present in the domain compared with the whole protein (Table 1). As could be expected, the highest scoring amino acids are tryptophan and glycine, followed by asparagine, serine, alanine and aspartic acid. The least expected amino acids in the WG/GW motifs are leucine, isoleucine, methionine, tyrosine and cystein. According to these calculations threonine is neutral, occurring at the same frequency in the domain as in any other part of the proteins. The properties of the side groups indicate a slight preference for small, hydrophilic and charged amino acids with, of course, the exception of the highest scoring hydrophobic tryptophan. The large number of amino acids having negative values (13 negative versus 6 with positive scores) and higher value range for negative scores (5.252 for leucine versus 2.666 for tryptophan) suggests rather a stronger negative selection against the presence of a number of amino acids rather than positive selection for others.The precise annotation of domain boundaries is another challenge in the analysis of domains without clear sequence similarity. Our analysis was carried out using a score table (Table 1) and the location of all WG/GW (and combinations thereof-see Materials and Methods section) motifs. During the process of domain identification the created algorithm moves from one residue to the next in both directions from the initial WG/GW motif, summing the values from the scoring table for each additional amino acid. The domain is extended as long as the calculated local score maximum (highest calculated value) does not drop below a given value. Precisely defined boundaries of the domain allow the calculation of cumulative score (dos), by summing the values from the scoring matrix for each amino acid. By careful selection of the decay value it was possible to achieve high precision in domain boundary identification, with 0.947 sensitivity and 0.946 selectivity scores (Supplementary Data).The qualification of the new WG/GW motifs based only on the presented scoring schema has one disadvantage-it depends solely on the length of the domain. Because no information was available at the moment of the analysis about the preferred size of the domain it was necessary to develop a second measure (internal domain composition score-ics), which is independent of the length of the sequence but, as for the first score, reflects the composition of the domain (see Material and Methods section). The ics scoring table (Supplementary Data) shows the highest relative difference of amino acid presence in the motif between glycine and phenylalanine (4.032 half-bits). The most homogeneous distribution in composition shows tryptophan and asparagine-indicated by the lowest value in the scoring table (0.336 half-bits). The components of the WG/GW motif-tryptophan and glycine-show a middle range value of 1.868 half-bits-indicating that one of them (glycine) is present at a higher level in the domain than the other (tryptophan).Finally, the introduction of both scoring systems, which provides a measurement of the degree of compositional compatibility of the new domains with the source domains used to calculate the scoring tables, allowed us to address the question of biological significance of the new findings. Based on simple statistical analysis it was possible to select new WG/GW motif-containing proteins which constitute good candidates for further experimental verification. Figure 2 presents the distribution of both scores (dos and ics) for all Arabidopsis proteins which contain at least one WG/GW motif. The sequences that fulfil the calculated cut-off criteria are indicated in red. The calculation of statistical significance was based on the selection of the mathematical model which best represents score values. Distribution fitting involved modeling of the probability distribution of a dos score variable in the Arabidopsis genome (see Materials and Methods section). The very stringent score value of 6.99 half-bits was selected, which corresponds to a P-value of 0.01 in the Arabidopsis dos score dataset. The ics score of 2.14 half-bits was chosen based on stringent formal criteria and linear parameter estimation (see Materials and Methods section). This guaranteed that the domains showing score values above the selected thresholds (indicated in Figure 2. in red) will have the same properties as source sequences used for the analysis, and therefore most likely can be classified in the same functional group of proteins (Supplementary Data-unfiltered list of all identified proteins).. Figure 2.Distribution of ics and dos scores of all identified proteins in Arabidopsis. Each point represents a WG/GW-containing protein. Grey dashed lines indicate dos and ics score threshold values revealing WG/GW protein candidates marked in red.The AGI identifiers of genes encoding proteins containing WG/GW motifs are presented in Table 2. In this table, we have only shown results for regions which were identified in both genomic and protein data screens after applying a cut-off score. Direct analysis of the genomic sequence identified only two potential WG/GW-coding regions which did not map to protein data. Both have an unusual compositional bias and most probably do not code for biologically functional proteins. Overall, we identified 20 different genes with two products of alternatively-spliced messengers for two of them. The alternative spliced forms of At1g65440, which are both supported by several full-length cDNA or EST sequences, are interesting in that they encode proteins which are identical in the N-terminal region, differing only in the length of the WG/GW platform (Figure 3B)..

Figure 3.Domain architectures of selected WG/GW proteins. Gene structures of two small gene families are shown. Exons are represented as boxes and introns by lines. The WG/GW motif-containing region is colored in brown. (A) Three members of the SPT5-like transcription elongation factor family, showing the extensive platform in the At5g04290 gene product. (B) Variable motif domain length illustrated by alternative splicing in the SPT6 global transcription elongation factor family.The size of the WG/GW domains ranges from 92 to 654aa (for At3g51940 and At5g04290 respectively). As could be expected, genes coding for proteins with already known WG/GW-dependent AGO-binding function (NRPE1 and KFT1/RDM3/SPT5-like) are among the highest scoring proteins. GTB1 is a member of the SPT6 family, implicated in transcription elongation in yeast and animals (39,40), while SDE3 is a protein already known to be involved in silencing mechanisms in Arabidopsis (41), although there is as yet no direct evidence for an interaction of the last two candidates with AGO proteins. There are also two plant-specific translation initiation factors (genes At1g13020 and At3g26400). Overall, the genes identified as encoding WG/GW proteins correspond in the majority of cases to a limited number of families: RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, glycine-rich proteins, translation initiation factors and known silencing-associated proteins such as SDE3.AGO binding to the WG motifs of a candidate proteinWe previously demonstrated in vitro binding of AGO4 proteins to the WG/GW motifs of proteins NRPE1 and SPT5-LIKE (11,28). To validate our bioinformatics analysis, we used the same approach to test the AGO-binding capacity of one of our candidate proteins, encoded by gene At3g51940 and annotated by TAIR as an oxidoreductase/transition metal ion binding protein (Table 2). We focused on this candidate as At3g51940 is an evolutionarily-conserved novel spliced gene which is expressed in Arabidopsis and whose product harbors a large WG/GW-rich platform containing 10 WG/GW motifs (Figure 4A and data not shown). Comparison of At3g51940 with sequences in the protein databases did not support the annotation proposed by TAIR, suggesting that the very limited similarity to a ferritin/ribonucleotide reductase-like domain is probably artefactual. This led us to rename this gene WGRP1, for WG/GW-Rich Protein 1. WGRP1 is ubiquitously expressed in Arabidopsis and contains 2 exons that encode a predicted WGRP1 protein of 454 amino acids (Figure 4A). Putative poplar and castor bean orthologs (XM_002332380 and XM_002513070 accession numbers for poplar and castor bean sequences, respectively) showing strong sequence conservation in the N-terminal 120 amino acids and significant enrichment of WG/GW motifs at their C-terminus were identified by BLAST (15) searching (data not shown). Conservation of WG/GW motifs in the WGRP1 orthologs from other plants suggested that they could be functionally significant and prompted us to test the Arabidopsis WGRP1 WG/GW-rich domain for AGO-binding capacity in vitro. We produced a fusion protein containing the WG/GW-rich domain (aa258-396) fused to GST (Figure 4B; GST-WGRP1) and monitored the ability of this construct to interact with AGO1 and AGO4 compared with the GST control protein. Pull-down assays indicated that GST-WGRP1, but not the GST control protein, specifically interacts with AGO4 but not AGO1, indicating a binding specificity of the WG/GW-rich domain of WGRP1 toward AGO4 in vitro (Figure 4C). Interestingly, this specificity in AGO4-binding capacity is similar to that recently demonstrated for SPT5-like in Arabidopsis (28). Although a possible role for WGRP1 in a plant silencing pathway remains to be clarified, this validation strongly supports the output of our bioinformatics screen.. Figure 4.WGRP1 protein has Argonaute-binding capacity. (A) Primary sequence of the Arabidopsis WGRP1 sequence. The evolutionarily conserved N-terminal sequence is bolded and the location of the intron relative to the open reading frame is indicated by a vertical arrowhead. The WG/GW motifs in the WGRP1 CTD are in red and the WGRP1 sequence fused to GST is underlined. (B) Coomassie staining of the purified GST and GST-WGRP1 recombinant proteins used in the Argonaute-binding assay. (C) Preferential binding of AGO4 to the WG/GW-rich domain of WGRP1 protein. Myc-AGO4 or Flag-AGO1 extracts were applied to equimolar amounts of GST and GST-based fusion protein beads and the bound protein (Pellet) and supernatant (Super) fractions detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc or anti-M2 antibodies. The GST protein was used as control.Identification of gene family membersThe use of very stringent threshold values could lead to the loss of some of the weak signals in the analysis. To avoid this, two strategies were employed: (i) the raw results representing all the WG/GW-motifs were presented in graphical form for manual verification and (ii) a BLAST-based re-screen of the Arabidopsis proteome was carried out to identify related sequences and compare families by multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT (42). The second approach resulted in identification of sequences related to candidate WG/GW-motif proteins based on the similarity of the sequence outside the variable domain. This data explosion step enriched the pool of WG proteins by including gene products which apparently did not contain any signatures of the domain of interest. This is the case for NRPD1 and NRPE1, in which the WG platform is internal, and for the putative transcription elongation factors SPT5-like (Figure 3A) and GTB1 (Figure 3B), in which the motifs are found in a C-terminal extension. The presence of WG/GW motifs as a C-terminal extension is found in several other candidate proteins.Virtual domain swappingIn the original experiment carried out by El-Shami et al. (11), the WG/GW-repeat region in the NRPE1 protein was exchanged with the related region of human GW182 protein (Figure 5A) to show functional conservation of the domain. They showed that the chimeric construct binds to AGO4 in vitro and is able to restore most of its DNA-methylation activity, while site-directed mutations of a tryptophan residue in the WG/GW motifs to phenylalanine or alanine disrupts AGO-binding activity in vitro. To verify whether the AGO-binding activity depends on the amino-acid composition of WG/GW domains, we designed a simulation of domain swapping experiments between plant and mammalian WG/GW proteins (Figure 5B), using plant or animal matrices. In this way, application of the heterologous matrices to screen in silico for WG/GW proteins simulates the original domain swapping experiment.. Figure 5.Domain-swapping experiment simulation. (A) Pairwise alignment of WG/GW-rich domains from Arabidopsis largest polV subunit, NRPE1 and Human GW182. (B) Outline of the virtual domain swapping experiment between plant and mammalian WG/GW proteins. Dos/ics score tables were calculated based on experimentally-verified plant/mammalian WG/GW proteins and subsequently used to search for WG/GW domains in mammalian/plant proteomes. Detected putative WG/GW motif proteins were compared with experimentally verified AGO-binding proteins. Reciprocal best protein hits of such a bidirectional procedure share a conserved amino-acid composition of WG/GW-rich AGO-binding sites.Based on the score table calculated on plant proteins with experimentally proven AGO-binding activities, an exhaustive search for WG/GW domains was carried out in representative mammalian genomes (human, chimp, mouse, rat, cow, horse, dog, opossum, platypus and rhesus). The highest scoring proteins identified in this screen (Table 3-list of highest scoring mammalian proteins sorted by ics score and selected with plant specific cut-off threshold values) include all AGO-binding GW182-related proteins, including human TNRC6A (P-value: 1.94E-06), TNRC6B (P-value: 7.11E-07) and TNRC6C (P-value: 1.24E-06). The full, unfiltered list of all identified mammalian proteins is presented as a Supplementary Data. Most of the identified top scoring proteins in the list have not been tested for interaction with AGO proteins (Table 3). This group contains large number of keratinocyte-associated proteins (e.g. highest scoring hornerin and dermatokine) which are know to form large molecular complexes but are unlikely involved in AGO-mediated gene silencing. Other proteins identified in the screen include splicing factors, zinc-finger, homeobox proteins and kinases, which can be considered as potential AGO-binding candidates. There are similarities between the functional categories of the mammalian proteins and the list of Arabidopsis putative WG/GW proteins, although in both cases further experimental work is essential to validate the bioinformatic screen..

PMC4057743	2.. Results. . 2.1.. Identification of RCAR1/PYL9-Interacting Proteins by Yeast Two-Hybrid Screening. The yeast two-hybrid system provides an efficient means to characterize core components in ABA signaling. The ABA receptor RCAR1/PYL9 has been identified by this system using ABI2 as bait [5]. Here, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with RCAR1/PYL9. As a result, several different types of proteins were identified (Table S1). Three of them are closely related members of MYBs, namely AtMYB44, AtMYB70 and AtMYB77 (Table 1). AtMYB44 was shown to be involved in ABA signaling [15-17]. Thus, in the present study, we mainly focused our study on the interaction between RCAR1/PYL9 and AtMYB44 and the significance of their interaction in ABA signaling based on the biochemical and molecular analysis.. To test whether the full-length AtMYB44 and RCAR1/PYL9 interact, additional yeast two-hybrid assays were performed. As is shown in Figure 1A, AH109 yeast cells co-transformed with the full-length AtMYB44 prey construct and RCAR1/PYL9 bait vector grew well on SD/-L-T-H-A (-His-Ade) medium and turned blue on SD/-L-T (+His+Ade) + X-alpha-Gal medium compared with the control transformants, indicating that the full-length AtMYB44 indeed interacts with RCAR1/PYL9 in yeast. Considering that RCAR1/PYL9 is an ABA receptor and its conformation can be changed upon binding to ABA [3,13], we analyzed whether ABA affected the interaction between AtMYB44 and RCAR1/PYL9. Yeast two-hybrid assay showed that ABA had no significant effect on the interaction between these two proteins (Figure 1A).. . . 2.2.. Demonstration of the Physical Interaction between RCAR1/PYL9 and AtMYB44 in Vitro and in Vivo. To further confirm the interaction between RCAR1/PYL9 and AtMYB44, we performed in vitro GST pull-down assays. In these analyses, recombinant GST or GST-tagged RCAR1/PYL9 proteins were used to pull down His-tagged AtMYB44 proteins. As a result, AtMYB44 was retained by GST-RCAR1/PYL9 but not GST, suggesting that RCAR1/PYL9 interacts with AtMYB44 in vitro (Figure 1B). Subsequently, BiFC assay was employed to test the interaction between RCAR1/PYL9 and AtMYB44 in planta. AtMYB44 and RCAR1/PYL9 were fused to the N- and C-terminal region of YFP to form AtMYB44-YFPN and RCAR1-YFPC, respectively, and the two constructs were co-transfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts. The empty vectors (YFPC and YFPN) in combination with AtMYB44-YFPN or RCAR1-YFPC were used as negative controls. As a result, YFP fluorescence was observed in the nucleus of the protoplast cells co-transformed by AtMYB44-YFPN and RCAR1-YFPC, while the negative controls failed to yield any fluorescent signal (Figure 1C). This result suggests that AtMYB44 interacts with RCAR1/PYL9 in the nucleus of Arabidopsis cells.. . . 2.3.. Analyses of the Interactions between RCARs/PYR1/PYLs and Other Members of the 22nd Subgroup of R2R3-MYBs. Considering that AtMYB44 belongs to the 22nd subgroup of R2R3-MYBs [20], we tested whether RCAR1/PYL9 also interacted with other members of the 22nd subgroup. Thus, AtMYB70, AtMYB73, AtMYB77 and AtMYB2 (as a control) were tested for their potential interactions with RCAR1/PYL9 in yeast two-hybrid assay. Figure 2A showed that RCAR1/PYL9 also interacted with AtMYB70, AtMYB73 and AtMYB77, but not with AtMYB2, a member of another subgroup of R2R3-MYBs, indicating that RCAR1/PYL9 may specially interact with the 22nd subgroup of MYBs. Similarly, ABA did not significantly affect the interactions between these proteins (Figure 2A).. RCARs/PYR1/PYLs have been grouped into three different classes in Arabidopsis and RCAR1/PYL9 belongs to class I [5]. To test whether AtMYB44 also interacts with the other two classes of RCARs/PYR1/PYLs, RCAR3/PYL8, RCAR8/PYL5 and RCAR11/PYR1 were chosen for representative of different classes. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that AtMYB44 only interacted with RCAR3/PYL8, but not with RCAR8/PYL5 and RCAR11/PYR1 (Figure 2B), suggesting that AtMYB44 may specially interact with the 1st subclass of RCARs/PYR1/PYLs [5].. . . 2.4.. AtMYB44 Negatively Regulates the Expression of ABA-Responsive Gene RAB18. To understand the significance of the interaction between RCAR1/PYL9 and AtMYB44, we first investigated the role of AtMYB44 in ABA signaling. As mentioned above, there were controversial issues regarding the roles of AtMYB44 in the literature. In order to clarify these issues, we investigated the effect of a knockout mutation of AtMYB44 on the expression of RAB18, an important marker gene in ABA signaling [21,22], using a T-DNA insertion mutant of AtMYB44 (atmyb44) [15-17]. Analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that expression of RAB18 was slightly enhanced in the atmyb44 mutant compared to that in wild-type plants, both in the absence and presence of exogenous ABA (Figure 3A), indicating that AtMYB44 negatively regulates the expression of RAB18.. To further test the effect of up-regulation of AtMYB44 on the expression of ABA-responsive gene RAB18, we performed transient activation assays with Arabidopsis protoplasts using the RAB18 promoter fused to the FLUC gene (pRAB18::FLUC) as a reporter. In these assays, the effector genes, AtMYB44-Myc or ABI1-GFP, were expressed under the control of the 35S promoter and co-transfected together with the reporter construct into the protoplasts. Analysis of LUC activity demonstrated that co-transfection of pRAB18::FLUC with AtMYB44-Myc resulted in 1.5- and 4-fold reduced pRAB18::FLUC expression in the absence and presence of 5 muM ABA, respectively (Figure 3B). This suggests that AtMYB44 acts as a negative regulator in the expression of RAB18 like ABI1, which is consistent with the result of microarray data published by Jaradat et al. [16].. . . 2.5.. AtMYB44 and ABI1 Compete for Binding to RCAR1/PYL9. To understand how AtMYB44 negatively regulates the expression of ABA-responsive genes, we further focused on the interaction between AtMYB44 and RCAR1/PYL9. Previous reports showed that competition might occur when two proteins interacted with the same protein. For example, the interaction between DELLAs and JAZs affects the binding of MYC2 to JAZs [23], and the interaction between SOS3 and SOS2 affects the binding of ABI2 to SOS2 [24]. Since RCAR1/PYL9 protein functions as an ABA receptor through interacting with PP2Cs and inhibiting their phosphatase activities in the presence of ABA [5,6], the interaction between RCAR1/PYL9 and PP2Cs may affect the binding between RCAR1/PYL9 and AtMYB44. To test this possibility, we performed competitive GST pull-down assays. Recombinant GST or GST-AtMYB44 was used to pull down His-RCAR1/PYL9 in the absence or presence of His-ABI1 (one member of PP2Cs). In the presence of ABA, the interaction between His-RCAR1/PYL9 and GST-AtMYB44 was significantly impaired by an increased amount of His-ABI1 (Figure 4). In another assay, His protein was used as a control instead of His-ABI1. As is shown in Figure 4, His protein did not affect the binding of His-RCAR1/PYL9 and GST-AtMYB44. These results reveal that AtMYB44 and ABI1 compete in vitro for binding to RCAR1/PYL9 in the presence of ABA. To test whether other proteins that interact with RCAR1/PYL9 also compete with ABI1 for the binding to RCAR1/PYL9 in the presence of ABA, ArathEULS3 (one protein listed in Table S1) was representatively chosen for research. However, no significant competition between ABI1 and ArathEULS3 was found in our competitive pull down assay (data not shown), suggesting that not all proteins that interact with RCAR1/PYL9 can compete with ABI1 for the binding to RCAR1/PYL9.. . . 2.6.. AtMYB44 Probably Reduces the Inhibitory Effect of RCAR1/PYL9 on ABI1 Activity in Vitro and in Vivo. Competition between AtMYB44 and ABI1 for binding to RCAR1/PYL9 led us to believe that AtMYB44 could facilitate releasing ABI1 from the ABI1-RCAR1/PYL9 complex through competing with the binding of RCAR1/PYL9 in the presence of ABA. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of AtMYB44 on RCAR1/PYL9-mediated inhibition of ABI1 phosphatase activity using recombinant His-ABI1, GST, GST-AtMYB44, and His-RCAR1/PYL9. As is shown in Figure 5, in the presence of ABA, AtMYB44 proteins alone did not affect the activity of ABI1, but RCAR1/PYL9 proteins alone significantly inhibited its activity as described [5]. When AtMYB44 proteins were added to the reaction mixtures of RCAR1/PYL9 and ABI1, the inhibitory effect of RCAR1/PYL9 on ABI1 phosphatase activity was significantly reduced in the presence of ABA rather than in the absence of ABA (Figure 5), suggesting that AtMYB44 interferes with the ability of RCAR1/PYL9 to suppress ABI1 phosphatase activity through competing for binding to RCAR1/PYL9 with ABI1 in the presence of ABA. To test whether other proteins that interact with RCAR1/PYL9 also affect RCAR1/PYL9-mediated inhibition of ABI1 activity in the presence of ABA, ArathEULS3 (one protein listed in Table S1) was representatively chosen for research. However, no significant effect was found in our PP2C enzyme assay (data not shown), suggesting that not all proteins that interact with RCAR1/PYL9 can reduce the RCAR1/PYL9-mediated inhibition of ABI1 activity.. To determine the role of AtMYB44 in regulating the inhibitory effect of RCAR1/PYL9 on ABI1 phosphatase activity in vivo, we performed transient activation assay. Wild-type Arabidopsis protoplasts were co-transfected with pRAB18::FLUC reporter construct and the indicated combinations of effector constructs encoding ABI1-GFP, RCAR1/PYL9-HA and AtMYB44-Myc. As is shown in Figure 6, transfection of ABI1 significantly suppressed pRAB18::LUC expression in the presence of exogenous 5 muM ABA, consistent with the role of ABI1 as a negative regulator of ABA-responsive genes [25,26]. Addition of RCAR1/PYL9 weakened the suppression of ABI1 on pRAB18::LUC expression, consistent with the result that RCAR1/PYL9 inhibits the phosphatase activity of ABI1 [5]. However, this antagonism is significantly reduced by further co-transfection of AtMYB44, indicating that AtMYB44 may also reduce the inhibitory effect of RCAR1/PYL9 on ABI1 in vivo. We noted that AtMYB44 alone also slightly increased ABI1-mediated inhibition of pRAB18::LUC expression (about 1.55-fold lower than without AtMYB44 in the presence of ABA), but its effect on antagonizing RCAR1/PYL9-mediated inhibition of ABI1 activity was more significant when RCAR1/PYL9 was co-expressed, where pRAB18::LUC expression was about 2.66-fold lower than without AtMYB44 in the presence of ABA (Figure 6). This result suggests that AtMYB44 alone increasing ABI1-mediated inhibition of pRAB18::LUC expression probably results from its inhibitory effect on endogenous RCAR1/PYL9-mediated inhibition of endogenous ABI1 activity in vivo..
PMC3009710	Results. . ATL9 (Arabidopsis txicos en levadura 9) encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase with homology to a family of genes induced by wounding and abiotic stress. Previous studies by our group have shown that mutants in the gene At2g35000 were more susceptible to fungal infection than wild-type plants [6]. At2g35000 belongs to the ATL family [18], [19] of RING (really interesting new gene) zinc-finger proteins and was designated as ATL9 in a previous review [12]. The ATL9 protein consists of 378 amino acids and contains an N-terminal signal peptide; two predicted transmembrane domains, a C3HC4 RING zinc-finger domain, a PEST domain and a C-terminal coiled coil region (Figure 1A). Three members of the Arabidopsis ATL gene family, ATL2, ATL6 and ATL17, are presumed to play a role in defense although their precise functions are unknown at present [21], [25]. Using database searches we identified a total of eight proteins with a high percentage of homology to ATL9, including several ATLs in other plant species such as Oryza sativa (EL5) [26], Nicotiana tabacum (Avr9) [27] or Poplar (PtaRHE1) [28]. An alignment of the eight protein sequences along with their putative function in defense is shown in Figure 1B. Of the eight proteins, seven are known to be specifically induced by elicitors and four of the proteins (ATL9, ATL2/ACRE132, ATL6 and ATL17) are induced specifically by flagellin or chitin (Figure 1B). All eight proteins contain a RING zinc-finger motif with six highly conserved cysteine residues that match the consensus sequence for the C3HC4 type (RING zinc-finger) domain group (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/). Of the genes found only three, ATL9 in Arabidopsis, NtACRE132 in tobacco and OsBIRF1 in rice have been tested for their putative role in response to pathogens (Figure 1B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014426.g001. Figure 1. . ATL9 structure and sequence alignment between ATL family members.. A) Schematic diagram of ATL9 protein structure. The protein has an N terminal region (cytosolic), containing a signal peptide (gray); two transmembrane domains (Tm1 and Tm2, in black); and a C3HC3 RING Zinc-finger domain (dark gray), a PEST sequence and a coiled coil domain that extends into the ER lumen (white). B) Alignment of ATL9 RING Zinc-finger domain amino acid sequence with the other ATL family members implicated in defense responses in plants. Asterisks indicate conserved cysteines; conserved amino acids are indicated in black, residues conserved in more than an 87.5% are highlighted in gray. The consensus sequence for this group of RING zinc-fingers is: C-X2-CL-X-E-X7-R-X2-P-X-C-X-H-X-FH-X2-C-X-D-X-W-X6-CP-X-C, where X is any amino acid. Induction of the corresponding genes is indicated as: C (chitin), F (flagellin), P (pathogens), Av (Avr9), BTH (benzothaidiazole), ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid), CWP (cell wall protein fraction elicitor), (+) indicates mutants in these genes have been tested for altered pathogen response.. . . . . . The induction of ATL9 is independent of the classical defense pathways. Studies have shown that chitin-induced defense responses act through an independent signaling pathway and are not dependent on SA-, JA- or ET-mediated responses [29]. In some cases, however, expression levels of chitin-induced genes were found to be slightly compromised in mutants defective in the SA- and JA-dependent signaling pathways suggesting some level of cross-talk [29]. In order to determine whether the induction of ATL9 was mediated solely by chitin or might also be regulated by the SA-, JA- or ET-dependent signaling pathways, Col-0 plants and mutants impaired in each signaling pathway (SA: sid2-1, npr1-1; JA: jar1; ET: ein2-5) were treated with chitin for 30 minutes and ATL9 expression was monitored. All plants tested showed induction of ATL9 when treated with chitin compared to untreated controls, although in all cases levels of induction in the mutant lines were lower than in wild type. Induction of ATL9 by chitin treatment was higher in Col-0 plants than in any other line tested (Figure 2A). Among the mutants, the highest levels of ATL9 induction were detected in the ein2-5 and npr1-1 mutants, while ATL9 levels in sid2-1 and jar-1 were the lowest (Figure 2A). The basal levels of ATL9 in each of the mutants are slightly lower or higher than in Col-0 (inset Figure 2A). From these data it appears that the induction of ATL9 expression by chitin is not dependent on the SA and JA signaling pathways.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014426.g002. Figure 2. . Influence of SA-, JA- and ET-mediated pathways on ATL9 expression measured by qRT-PCR.. A) Induction of ATL9 30 minutes after chitin treatment in Col-0 wild-type plants and in the ein2-5, jar1 and sid2-1 mutants. B) Induction of ATL9 (black), PR1 (light gray) and PDF1.2 (dark gray) in Col-0 plants after treatment with chitin (CSC), 50 M ACC, 5 M JA or 0.5 mM SA. Data represent the ratio between mock and treated plants of three independent biological samples. The inset shows relative expression of ATL9 transcript compared to the actin control (RE/Actin).. . . . To resolve the contributions of each signaling pathway to overall levels of ATL9 expression, we treated wild type plants with chitin, SA, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and JA [30], [31]. Expression of ATL9 and marker genes associated with each pathway (SA: PR1; JA- and Ethylene: PDF1.2) were quantified 30 minutes after treatment. Only treatment with crab-shell chitin (CSC) induced expression of ATL9 (Figure 2B). Exposure of plants to ACC, JA and SA resulted in no appreciable expression of the gene (Figure 2B) providing evidence that ATL9 induction is uniquely associated with chitin-mediated defense responses. As expected, marker genes associated with each of the classical defense pathways were induced by their corresponding signaling molecule (Figure 2B). These results suggest that the SA-, ethylene- and JA-mediated defense pathways do not directly regulate ATL9 expression but might feedback on the chitin-induced expression of ATL9.. . . ATL9 is involved in plant defense against G. cichoracearum. Mutations in ATL9 rendered plants more susceptible to infection by the biotrophic fungus G. cichoracearum compared to the wild type plants. To more precisely quantify the susceptibility of atl9 mutants to G. cichoracearum, inoculations were performed using three independent atl9 T-DNA insertional lines, 35S:ATL9 plants, Col-0, the Kas-1 Arabidopsis accession and sid2-1 plants. Counts of mature conidiophores 6 dpi showed that all three atl9 mutants (atl9-1, atl9-2, atl9-3) supported more than two times the number of mature conidiophores per fungal colony compared to wild type (Figure 3A). The atl9-1, atl9-2 and atl9-3 mutations all resulted in a more pronounced susceptibility phenotype than observed in wild type plants. All plants tested were more susceptible than the resistant Kas-1 ecotype and complementation of the atl9 mutation restored the wild-type defense phenotype (data not shown). Transformed plants containing an over-expression construct of ATL9 were significantly more resistant to G. cichoracearum and showed a 2-fold decrease in conidiophores per colony compared to wild-type plants (Figure 3A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014426.g003. Figure 3. . Susceptibility of atl9 mutants to Golovinomycetes cichoracearum and hydrogen peroxide production.. A) Quantification of Golovinomyces cichoracearum growth on Col-0 plants, three different atl9 T-DNA insertional mutants (atl9-1-3), 35S:ATL9, Kas-1, AtrbohD, AtrbohF, AtrbohD/F and the SA-compromised mutant sid2-1. The number of conidiophores per colony (c/c) were counted 6 dpi. Inoculations were performed at a low density (5-10 conidia/mm2; n=36 plants). Data values represent one of at least three independent experiments with similar results. B) Production of hydrogen peroxide on plants infected with G. cichoracearum. Cleared leaves of infected plants were stained with trypan blue which stains the fungal hyphae and conidiophores on the leaf surface. Secondary staining with DAB was performed to indicate areas of hydrogen peroxide production (indicated by peroxidase activity). a, Kas-1, b, Col-0, c, atl9-1, d, AtrbohD, f, AtrbohD/F, g, sid2-1. Arrows indicate fungal penetration points in epidermal cells with detected hydrogen peroxide production. The images were taken at a final magnification of 40x. Bars.- 5 m. C) Quantification of hydrogen peroxide production in mutants. The intensity of DAB staining was quantified at each inoculated plant and compared to the corresponding uninoculated control to obtain a relative DAB signal. The quantification was performed with the aid of the program Image J.. . . . Since previously published microarray data (NASC array) indicated that expression of ATL9 in roots was compromised in the NADPH oxidase AtrbohC mutant, we tested the defense phenotype of mutants in the NADPH oxidases AtrbohD and AtrbohF which are expressed in leaves and in the double mutant AtrbohD/F against G. cichoracearum (Figure 3A). AtrbohD, AtrbohF and the SA-compromised sid2-1 mutant showed comparable numbers of conidiophores per colony and were significantly more susceptible than atl9, the 35S:ATL9 line, Col-0 or the resistant Kas-1 accession. The AtrbohD/F double mutant was the most susceptible to powdery mildew even surpassing that of sid2-1 suggesting an additive effect of the individual mutations (Figure 3A).. Because the ROS response is essential for disease resistance we decided to determine if ROS production was compromised in atl9 mutant and in the Atrboh mutants (Arabidopsis thaliana respiratory burst oxidase homolog). Infected leaves of each mutant were double stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB) to visualize H2O2 and with trypan blue to observe the spread of the fungus 7 dpi with powdery mildew (Figure 3B). Consistent with our hypothesis, H2O2 production was much lower in atl9, compared to that of Col-0 or Kas-1 plants (Figure 3B). H2O2 localization was focused at points where the fungus was attempting to penetrate the epidermal cells (Arrows, Figure 3B). DAB staining of H2O2 was not visible in AtrbohD/F or the sid2-1 mutant (Figure 3B). Hydrogen peroxide was detected both at the point of fungal penetration as well as inside some epidermal cells in Col-0 plants (Figure 3B). The highest levels of hydrogen peroxide were detected in the resistant Kas-1 ecotype (Figure 3B) with the highest levels of H2O2 localizing to points of fungal penetration and in the epidermal cells directly adjacent to penetrated cells. High H2O2 levels in Kas-1 correlated with a strong inhibition of fungal growth and colony development (Figure 3B). In all cases there was good inverse correlation between the conidiophores per colony (Figure 3A) and the levels of H2O2 detected in leaves via DAB staining (Figure 3C). Taken together these data indicate that ROS production in epidermal cells is necessary for effective defense against G. cichoracearum and this ROS production is impaired in the atl9 mutant, AtrbohD and AtrbohF. This provides further evidence that functional ATL9, AtrbohD and AtrbohF expression are needed for effective defenses against powdery mildew.. . . Basal expression of ATL9 and induction by chitin depends on NADPH oxidase activity. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a key characteristic of the initial defense response of plants to pathogen attack and chitin treatment is known to elicit ROS production in roots although not in leaves [32]. Several NADPH oxidases in Arabidopsis have been identified and their roles in ROS generation and plant defense characterized [33], [34], [35]. A search of publically available microarray data (http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/narrays/geneswinger.pl) revealed that expression of ATL9 in roots was repressed by 50% in the AtrbohC mutant [36] compared to wild-type plants. AtrbohC plants are also more susceptible to the powdery mildew pathogen G. cichoracearum (data not shown). These data raised the possibility that the induction of ATL9 by chitin might be dependent on NADPH oxidase activity. To test this hypothesis we treated Col-0 plants and three mutants impaired in NADPH activity (AtrbohD, AtrbohF, AtrbohD/F) with chitin and analyzed the transcript levels of ATL9 by qRT-PCR (Figure 4). The MAPK3 gene was used as a control since it is known to be induced by chitin [29]. Though ATL9 was induced by chitin in Col-0 plants, its induction was significantly reduced in the three Atrboh mutants (Figure 4). ATL9 was still expressed in untreated Atrboh mutants but at half of that observed in untreated wild-type plants (inset Figure 4). These data indicate that basal expression levels of ATL9 are dependent on AtrbohD and F.. A similar pattern of reduced induction and reduced basal expression was observed for the MAPK3 gene in all the lines tested (Figure 4 and inset). These results indicate that both basal transcription levels of ATL9 as well as the induction of ATL9 by chitin depend on NADPH oxidase activity. These results are in line with previous NASC array data showing that ATL9 transcription levels are impaired in the AtrbohC mutant.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014426.g004. Figure 4. . The basal expression of ATL9 and its induction by chitin depends on NADPH oxidases.. Plants were treated with chitin for 30 minutes and harvested for analysis. Expression levels of ATL9 were measured by qRT-PCR. The inset shows the relative expression of ATL9 transcript compared to actin (RE/Actin) in control plants. Data represent the ratio of expression between mock and treated plants of three independent biological samples.. . . . . . ATL9 is induced by G. cichoracearum and has a complex pattern of expression post-inoculation. Since atl9 mutants are more susceptible to G. cichoracearum (Figure 3A) than wild-type plants and ATL9 basal expression and induction by chitin is dependent on NADPH oxidases (Figure 4 and inset), we were interested in determining the timing of ATL9 expression after fungal infection. Expression levels of ATL9, AtrbohD, AtrbohF, and the defense marker genes PR1 and PDF1.2 were monitored using qRT-PCR at several time points after infection with powdery mildew [37], [38]. Wild-type plants were heavily inoculated with G. cichoracearum and tissue samples were taken at four early time points: 1 hr., 1.5 hr., 2 hr. and 4 hr. post-infection and at two late infection time points; 24 hr. and 48 hours post-infection (hpi). Quantitative analysis of the gene expression revealed that ATL9 is induced very early in the infection process (1 hr.; Figure 5) and then expression quickly drops off to negligible levels at 4 hpi in a pattern similar to that of PR1 expression (Figure 5). ATL9 expression again rose in the later time points (24 and 48 hpi). By 24 hpi, ATL9 expression was again induced to levels similar to those observed in the 1 hour time point (Figure 5). AtrbohD, AtrbohF, and PDF1.2 were not significantly induced early in the infection process but were present at higher levels in the later stages of the infection beginning at 24 hpi (Figure 5). These data may indicate that an early step in pathogen recognition or the infection process is critical for activation of AtrbohD, AtrbohF, and PDF1.2.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014426.g005. Figure 5. . Relative expression levels of selected genes at various time points after inoculation with Golovinomyces cichoracearum.. Col-0 plants were inoculated with G. cichoracearum at high concentration. qRT-PCR data represent the ratio between mock and treated plants of three independent biological samples.. . . . . . ATL9 has ubiquitin ligase activity. The RING zinc-finger domain is known to be essential for the function of ubiquitin E3 ligases [39] and two other members of the ATL family, ATL2 and ATL6, have been identified as E3 ligases in Arabidopsis [18], [21]. In order to determine whether ATL9 might function as an E3 ligase, we analyzed ATL9 activity using an in vitro ubiquitination assay (Figure 6). A GST:ATL9 fusion protein was affinity purified and its E3 ligase activity was assayed in vitro. Multiple forms of ubiquitinated proteins were detected in the complete assay by the anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Figure 6, lane 1). The omission of AtUBC8 (Figure 6, lane 2), GST-ATL9 (Figure 6, lane 3) or ubiquitin (Figure 6, lane 4) from the assay resulted in a loss of protein polyubiquitination (Figure 6, lane 1) confirming that ATL9 has ubiquitin ligase activity.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014426.g006. Figure 6. . ATL9 is capable of mediating protein ubiquitination in a E2-dependent manner.. The complete in vitro ubiquitination assay (lane 1) contained recombinant yeast E1 enzyme, recombinant 6x histidine-tagged Arabidopsis E2 enzyme UBC8, GST-tagged ATL9 and ubiquitin. Omission of AtUBC8 (lane 2), GST-ATL9 (lane 3) or ubiquitin (lane 4) from the assay resulted in a loss of protein polyubiquitination as indicated by a lack of the ubiquitinated proteins compared to the complete assay (lane 1). Ubiquitinated proteins were visualized by western blot analysis using anti-ubiquitin antibodies. * Indicate non-specific cross-reactive proteins.  Represent AtUBC8-Ub(n). Molecular weight markers (kDa) are shown to the left of the blot.. . . . . . The ATL9 protein is localized to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Defense-related proteins can be found in a diverse array of cellular compartments. To determine the localization of ATL9, a construct was made containing a C-terminal fusion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the ATL9 gene under the control of its native promoter (ATL9p:ATL9:GFP). Stable transgenic lines were created by transforming Col-0 plants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the ATL9p:ATL9:GFP construct. Upon visualization, fluorescent signal was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of leaf epidermal cells (Figure 7A-C). Localization of ATL9 was observed in the ER of all tissues tested and was particularly high in roots (Figure 7A-C; data not shown). For more precise localization a second construct containing a fusion of GFP to the C-terminus of ATL9 driven by the CaMV 35S promoter (35S:ATL9:GFP) was co-bombarded into onion epidermal cells with a known ER luminal marker ER-rk (signal peptide of AtWAK2:mCherry:HDEL) [40]. When visualized with fluorescent microscopy, 35S:ATL9:GFP co-localized with the ER-rk marker in the onion epidermal cells confirming its localization to the ER (Figure 7D-F). In parallel we also transiently expressed an N-terminal construct of ATL9, 35S:GFP:ATL9, in tobacco with a 35S:GFP construct as an internal negative control for GFP localization to the nucleus. Again, ATL9 was expressed transiently in the ER of tobacco epidermal cells confirming our results in Arabidopsis and onion (Figure S1A). Fluorescence was detectable within the nucleus in the tobacco cells expressing the 35S:GFP construct and the GFP signal could be seen in the ER surrounding the nuclear membrane (Figure S1B). A western blot with the protein extract from the transiently transformed tobacco tissue was performed and hybridized with anti-GFP antibody to confirm the size of the ATL9 and GFP fusion proteins (Figure S1C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014426.g007. Figure 7. . The ATL9 protein localizes to the ER..

Bars: 3 m (A,B), 1 m (C), 10 m (D-F).. . . . Since some PAMP response related proteins are transported to the vesicle after stress responses [41], we wanted to determine if ATL9 responded in a similar manner. To determine if ATL9 localization changed after elicitor treatment, transgenic plants expressing ATL9p:ATL9:GFP were treated with chitin (100 mg/L) by direct infiltration of the leaves and observed at five minute intervals for one hour. No change in ATL9 localization was detected regardless of the time after treatment with chitin (data not shown).. . . Microarray expression analysis of atl9. To identify genes whose expression is dependent on ATL9 function, Col-0 plants and atl9 mutants were treated with chitin for 30 minutes and their expression profiles were examined using Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. Of the 22,677 genes represented, 16,530 were defined as present and of these 4,375 genes showed altered expression in the atl9 mutant compared to wild-type plants (Figure 8A and 8B). Genes were divided into (1) those that exhibited genotype-specific differences in expression between wild type and atl9 and (2) those that responded to treatment with chitin. Figure 8B shows that the majority of genes that exhibited altered expression responded to chitin treatment regardless of plant genotype (3510), while a smaller number (525) fluctuated between wild-type plants and the atl9 mutant irrespective of treatment. An intermediate number of genes (340) were changed both by the loss of ATL9 expression and by chitin treatment (Figure 8B). Data on selected genes within each category are given in Table S1.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014426.g008. Figure 8. . Microarray analysis of atl9 mutant after chitin treatment.. A) Hierarchical cluster of ratio values (relative to the water control treatment) of 16,530 genes analyzed in Col-0 wild-type and atl9 plants treated with crab shell chitin (CSC) for 30 minutes. Each gene is represented by a single row and each column represents an individual treatment. Red represents up-regulated genes; blue, down-regulated genes; and yellow, genes with no change in expression. Groups of genes expressed differentially are delineated with rectangles. Three genes (black arrows) were changing due to interactions between treatment and genotype and one gene (red arrow) was genotype interaction specific. B) Venn diagram representation of results from hierarchical clustering. A total of 4,375 genes were differentially expressed between genotypes and treatments. The statistic used for clustering was two-way ANOVA. Genotype and treatment groups were analyzed using a p-value of 0.5 with p-value >0.5= not significant; p-value <0.5= significant.. . . . Several genes with known roles in plant defense were identified that were specifically altered between wild-type plants and atl9 mutants (Table S1). Two genes associated with SA-mediated defense responses, PR-1 and SID2/ICS1 were repressed in plants lacking ATL9 (Table S1). PR-1 levels (At2g14580) were decreased 3-fold in the atl9 mutant compared with Col-0 plants. This finding is surprising since we have shown that PR-1 gene expression is induced by infection with G. cichoracearum but not by chitin-treatment alone (Figure 5, Table S1). Expression of SID2/ICS1 (isochorismate synthase; At1g74710) was slightly down-regulated in the atl9 mutant (0.77-fold) compared to Col-0 though in both cases the gene was induced by chitin. PEN3 expression was reduced by 50% in the atl9 mutants in contrast to PEN1 and PEN2 whose expression was unchanged (Table S1). Expression of PDF2.5, an antimicrobial peptide, was slightly lower in atl9 plants compared to Col-0. However, when treated with chitin PDF2.5 was strongly induced in wild-type plants but its expression remained unchanged in the atl9 mutant (Table S1). Similarly the PCC1 gene (pathogen and circadian controlled 1) was down-regulated in response to the loss of ATL9. As in the case of PDF2.5, PCC1 was strongly up-regulated in Col-0 plants upon chitin treatment and was down-regulated in the atl9 mutant (Table S1).. Most of the defense genes surveyed were not significantly affected by the loss of atl9 expression and exhibited similar responses to chitin-treated control plants (Table S1). However, several defense genes had enhanced expression levels after chitin treatment in the atl9 mutant including PEN1, PAD4, two disease resistance-like proteins, ACRE1b, ATL17 and protein phosphatase 2C (Table S1). Interestingly, AtrbohD expression was induced to higher levels in chitin-treated atl9 compared with wild-type controls. Similar increases were not observed in the expression of AtrbohC or AtrbohF.. . . Defense genes associated with elicitor-mediated responses. To identify defense-related genes that were specifically linked to the chitin signaling pathway, we compared the expression of genes known to be induced by both abiotic and biotic stresses in chitin-treated Col-0 wild type and atl9 plants (Table S1). We first analyzed the expression levels of the ATL9 family members ATL2-ACRE132, ATL6 and ATL17 (Table S1). In all cases, the ATL family members were induced at significantly higher levels in wild-type plants, compared to atl9 mutants. This strongly suggests that ATL9 is important in initiating the expression of genes involved in chitin-mediated responses. We were also interested in determining the responses of the known elicitor receptors, CERK1 (LysM RLK1), FLS2, BAK1 and EFR in the atl9 mutant. The induction of the gene encoding the chitin receptor LysM RLK1 was essentially unchanged in the atl9 mutant and wild-type plants. Surprisingly, expression levels of the flagellin receptor gene, FLS2 were strongly induced by chitin in Col-0 plants but not in the mutant (Table S1), suggesting that induction of FLS2 may be dependent on ATL9 expression. Expression of BAK1 which acts as a co-receptor of flagellin with FLS2 [9], [42] and the bacterial EF-Tu receptor EFR [7] were both induced by chitin treatment but at similar levels in both the atl9 mutant and in wild-type plants. In addition, ACRE1b, a gene highly induced by treatment with flg22 [5] was also strongly induced by chitin treatment in wild-type plants. Taken together these results indicate that activation of elicitor-mediated signaling by chitin and flagellin are closely intertwined in plants.. To better understand the interactions between chitin-mediated defense signaling and signaling mediated through SA, JA and ET the expression levels of key genes in each of the signal transduction pathways were monitored (Table S1). The induction of MAPK3 and MAPK5, both known to be important in signaling pathways initiated by flagellin [43] were very similar in atl9 and Col-0 plants indicating that these MAP kinases are upstream of ATL9 activity or are working in an independent signal transduction network. A similar induction by chitin in both the atl9 mutant and wild-type was also observed for MAPKK4. Other genes involved in SA-, JA- and ET-mediated signaling (RAR1, SGT1, HSP90, COI1, ETR1, EIN3, PAD2, JAR1 or SAG101) showed no differences in expression levels in either chitin-treated control or atl9 plants or in mock-treated plants pointing to the fact that these genes are not influenced by ATL9 expression. However, the expression of the lipoxygenase-3 (LOX3) gene, which is involved in octadecanoid biosynthesis leading to the production of JA in plants, was highly induced in both atl9 and Col-0 plants by chitin..
PMC2791118	Results. . Mild salt stress inhibits primary and lateral root elongation and stimulates LR proliferation. To examine how salt stress affects Arabidopsis LR proliferation, the dose response of Arabidopsis seedlings to increasing salt concentration was tested. Seedlings were germinated and grown on vertical nutrient agar plates until the root was 2 cm long (4-5 d) and then transferred to fresh plates with increasing levels of NaCl. At the time of transfer no LRs were visible. Figure 1 shows that increasing NaCl levels up to 50 mM stimulated the production of LRs, where seedlings exhibited virtually twice the number of first order LRs (emerged LRs) after 21 d than the control (0 mM NaCl) and also produced a few second order LRs (data not shown). However, the transfer of seedlings to 100 mM salt stress caused almost complete inhibition of LR development. These results suggest an acclimation response of LR development to mild levels of salt stress.. . Fig. 1.. . Effect of NaCl concentration on Arabidopsis lateral root number. Seedlings grown on 1 mM KNO3 medium for 4-5 d were transferred to the same medium plus the indicated concentrations of NaCl for 21 d. Data are mean emerged LRs SE (n=30). Bars with different letters indicate significant difference at P 0.05 (Fisher's protected LSD test). The data are representative of similar results in three independent experiments.. . . . To investigate the stimulatory effect of mild salt stress on LR development further, 4-5 d-old seedlings were transferred to vertical segmented nutrient agar plates with or without 50 mM NaCl (the NaCl concentration that had displayed the greatest stimulatory effect) in all the segments. It was observed that first order LR number increased significantly in the top and middle segments of the plate compared with unstressed plants (Fig. 2A). Salt stress caused an even greater stimulation of second order LR proliferation where stressed seedlings produced 8-fold more LRs than unstressed seedlings (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, only stressed plants developed third order LRs (Fig. 2C). By contrast with its stimulatory effect on LR number, salt stress led to a reduction in average LR length (Fig. 2D) with stressed LRs exhibiting approximately half the length of unstressed LRs. Moreover, although salt stress led to an increase in LR number, an evaluation of total LR length (a function of both total LR number and average LR length) suggested that the salt-mediated increase in LR number could not fully compensate for the reduction in the average LR length (Fig. 2E). Primary root elongation was severely reduced in stressed seedlings, which displayed a 4-fold reduction in primary root length compared with unstressed seedlings (Fig. 2F). Indeed, only unstressed primary roots reached the bottom segment of the plate, hence the absence of any first order stressed LRs in the bottom segment (Fig. 2A). Overall, our results suggest that mild salt stress stimulates an SIMR phenotype in contrast to severe salt stress where LR proliferation is inhibited.. . Fig. 2.. .

The data are representative of similar results in three independent experiments. Top, Middle, Bottom: the different segments of the segmented agar plate.. . . . . . Stimulation of LR proliferation by salt stress is enhanced upon transfer from low to high NO3-. The stimulatory effect of nitrate-enriched media on LR proliferation has been well documented (reviewed in Zhang et al., 2007). In Arabidopsis, the transfer from NO3--poor to NO3--rich medium predominantly stimulates LR elongation (Zhang et al., 1999; Linkohr et al., 2002). It was therefore tested whether transfer from low NO3- to NO3--rich medium would have a stimulatory effect on the LR component of the salt SIMR, by transferring seedlings grown on 10 muM KNO3 to plates containing 1 mM KNO3 with and without NaCl uniformly present across all plate segments. The enrichment of the NO3- supply led to a dramatic enhancement of the salt-induced increase in LR number. While first order LRs were induced to a similar extent as with salt alone (compare Figs. 2A and 3A) the mean number of second and third order LRs (16 and 8, respectively) exhibited a striking enhancement compared to salt stress alone (6.5 and 1.5, respectively) (compare Figs. 2B and 3B; 2C and 3C). On the other hand, when combined with salt treatment, the enrichment of the NO3- supply had no stimulatory effect on LR elongation (Fig. 3D); mean LR length was reduced to a similar degree as with salt stress alone (compare Figs. 2D and 3D). Strikingly, evaluation of total LR length showed that NO3- enhancement of the salt stress-induced increase in LR number fully compensated for the decreased average LR length (Fig. 3E). Primary root elongation was again severely inhibited in salt-stressed roots (Fig. 3F).. . Fig. 3.. . The LR proliferation component of the salt SIMR is enhanced by transfer from low to high NO3-.

The data are representative of similar results in three independent experiments. Top, Middle, Bottom: the different segments of the segmented agar plate.. . . . Salt stress comprises two stress components, namely osmotic stress and ionic stress. To determine whether the salt SIMR is specific to salt stress and not to osmotic stress alone, the effect of the latter on root architecture was tested. When seedlings were transferred from 10 muM KNO3 to 1 mM KNO3 supplemented with 100 mM mannitol, primary root elongation was only minimally affected by osmotic stress (compare Figs. 3F and 4E). Furthermore, instead of a stimulation of LR proliferation, a reduction in first order LR number was observed in stressed roots compared with unstressed roots (Fig. 4A). Moreover, second order LRs only appeared in unstressed roots (Fig. 4B) while no third order LRs were observed in either unstressed or stressed roots. The average LR length was reduced by osmotic stress in a similar manner to salt stress (Fig. 4C) and this reduction in average LR length combined with the decreased LR number led to a large fall in total LR length (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained when seedlings were transferred to mannitol but without the stimulatory effect of NO3--enrichment (transfer of seedlings from 1 mM KNO3 to 1 mM KNO3 with or without mannitol [data not shown]). These findings show that osmotic stress alone or in combination with NO3- enrichment is not sufficient to stimulate a characteristic SIMR.. . Fig. 4.. . Osmotic stress alone inhibits LR elongation but does not stimulate LR proliferation. (A-E) Seedlings grown on 10 muM KNO3 medium for 4-5 d were transferred to 1 mM KNO3 medium 100 mM mannitol for 21 d.

The data are representative of similar results in three independent experiments. Top, Middle, Bottom: the different segments of the segmented agar plate.. . . . . . Greater numbers of LRPs develop into LRs during the NO3--enhanced salt SIMR. It was next investigated whether development of LR primordia (LRPs) is affected during the NO3--enhanced salt SIMR. Seedlings were again grown on 10 muM KNO3 and transferred to plates containing 1 mM KNO3 with and without NaCl uniformly present across all plate segments. Visualization of LRPs was performed by staining with acetocarmine (Enstone et al., 2001) and the development of each primordium assessed by combining the detailed stages of LRP development assigned by Malamy and Benfey (1997) into four broad phases: (INT) initiation, (CP) cell proliferation, (PE) pre-emergence, and (E) emergence (Fig. 5A). Almost 60% of first order LRPs reached the E stage in stressed seedlings whereas the greatest proportion (42%) of LRPs in unstressed plants was still at the PE stage of development (Fig. 5B). Although similar numbers of INT stage LRPs in unstressed and stressed seedlings were observed, no CP stage LRPs in stressed seedlings were detected compared to 21% CP stage LRPs from unstressed seedlings. Similar results were observed with second order LRPs although, as expected, a greater percentage of LRPs from both unstressed and stressed seedlings were in the earlier stages of development than first order LRPs (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, the highest proportion of second order LRPs in stressed plants was at the E stage of development whereas the greatest percentage of LRPs in unstressed plants was at the PE stage. These results suggest that while the proportion of LRPs being initiated in both unstressed and stressed plants is similar, the overall increase in LR number in stressed roots (Fig. 5D) is either due to the arrest of a proportion of LRPs in unstressed plants at the pre-emergence stage of development or, alternatively, LRPs in stressed roots develop at a faster rate.. .

(D) * Significant difference (P 0.05) between unstressed and stressed roots (Fisher's protected LSD test). The data are representative of similar results in three independent experiments.. . . . . . NO3--enhanced, salt stress stimulation of LR proliferation is mediated by auxin. One of the major generic characteristics of root SIMR phenotypes is the increased proliferation of LRs (Potters et al., 2007). Auxin is a key regulator of LR development. It promotes LRP initiation by the local activation of root pericycle cells and also plays a role in LR emergence (Reed et al., 1998; Casimiro et al., 2001; Bhalerao et al., 2002; Marchant et al., 2002; De Smet et al., 2007; Okushima et al., 2007; Dubrovsky et al., 2008). It was therefore investigated whether the LR proliferation component of the NO3--enhanced salt SIMR is mediated by auxin, by testing if salt stress can still induce LR proliferation in (i) an auxin synthesis mutant, nit1-3 (Normanly et al., 1997) [NIT1 is one of three nitrilases that catalyse a biosynthetic step in one of several IAA biosynthesis pathways (Woodward and Bartels, 2005)]; (ii) auxin transport mutants, axr4-2, aux1-7 (Picket et al., 1990; Dharmasiri et al., 2006); (iii) auxin signalling mutants, axr1-3, tir1-1, eta3/tir1-1 (the eta3 background enhances the tir-1-1 phenotype) (Lincoln et al., 1990; Ruegger et al., 1998; Gray et al., 2003; Dharmasiri et al., 2005; Kepinski et al., 2005). All auxin mutants exhibited decreases in either, or both, unstressed and stressed LR number compared to wild-type (Fig. 6A). However, while the stimulation of LR proliferation under salt stress was observed in the axr1-3, axr4-2, nit1-3, tir1-1, and eta3/tir1-1 mutants, it was completely blocked in the aux1-7 mutant, suggesting that auxin transport, at least via AUX1, is essential for the LR proliferation component of the salt SIMR.. . Fig. 6.. . Salt stress affects auxin distribution in LRPs. (A-C) Total LR number, average LR length, and primary root length, respectively, of WT and auxin mutants transferred from 10 muM KNO3 to 1 mM KNO3 medium 50 mM NaCl for 8 d. Data are mean SE (n=20). * Significant difference (P 0.01) between unstressed and stressed roots (Tukey's post-hoc test). (D) LRP development visualized by DR5:GUS staining.

For (E), (F) and inset, data are mean SE (n=30). * Significant difference (P 0.05) between unstressed and stressed roots (Fisher's protected LSD test). The data are representative of similar results in three independent experiments.. . . . A clear trend showing a stress-induced decrease in average LR length could be observed in wild-type, axr1-3, axr4-2, nit1-3, and aux1-7 roots, although this decrease was not statistically significant except for the nit1-3 and aux1-7 mutants (Fig. 6B). No significant salt-mediated reduction in average LR length could be seen in the tir1-1 mutant, but this was due to a large decrease in unstressed LR elongation with little effect on stressed LR length. This phenotype was enhanced in the eta3/tir1-1 mutant. All mutants exhibited the wild-type inhibition of primary root elongation by salt stress (Fig. 6C). Overall, the results suggest that auxin does not play a role in the root elongation component of the salt SIMR but is important for LR elongation under unstressed conditions.. Our results indicate that at least auxin transport is essential for the salt-mediated stimulation of LR proliferation. AUX1 is an influx carrier that imports auxin into developing LRPs to regulate both LRP initiation and emergence (Marchant et al., 1999, 2002; Swarup et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2006). To test whether the LR proliferation component of the NO3--enhanced salt SIMR is associated with increased auxin accumulation, expression of the GUS reporter gene, driven by the auxin-sensitive DR5 promoter, was examined in developing LRPs. DR5 is an established indirect marker for auxin accumulation and is expressed from the earliest stages of LRP development (Ulmasov et al., 1997; Benkova et al., 2003; Dubrovsky et al., 2008). It was possible to detect LRP developmental stages INT to E by histochemical staining for GUS activity (Fig. 6D). Remarkably, only 20% of LRPs in unstressed seedlings exhibited GUS staining while 70% of LRPs in stressed seedlings were stained (Fig. 6E). Moreover, twice the number of LRPs per root system was observed in unstressed seedlings compared to stressed seedlings, whereas twice as many LRs had developed in stressed seedlings (Fig. 6F and inset in E). Taken together, these results suggest that the development of a greater number of LRP's is arrested in the absence of salt stress; the corollary being that salt stress stimulates the development of a larger proportion of LRPs and that this stimulation is associated with increased auxin accumulation in the LRPs. This finding correlates well with our observation that, while a similar proportion of LRPs in unstressed and stressed seedlings are initiated, a greater percentage of LRPs in roots of stressed seedlings reach developmental stage E than in unstressed seedlings where a proportion of LRPs appear to be arrested at the CP or PE stages (Fig. 5B, C).. . . ABA and an ethylene signalling factor regulate NO3--enhanced, salt stress stimulation of LR proliferation. In contrast to auxin, ABA exerts an inhibitory effect on LR development at the post-emergence stage (De Smet et al., 2003, 2006). Evidence suggests that ABA action on root development may require, at least in part, a functioning ethylene signalling network and that ABA inhibition of root growth is attenuated in ethylene signalling mutants such as ein2 and etr1 (Beaudoin et al., 2000; Ghassemian et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2002). It was therefore investigated whether ABA or ethylene signalling play a role in the NO3--enhanced salt SIMR by testing whether salt stress leads to a different phenotype from the wild type in the following ABA and ethylene mutants: (i) ABA synthesis mutants, aba2-1, aba3-1 (Leon-Kloosterziel et al., 1996; Schwartz et al., 1997); (ii) the ABA signalling mutant, abi4-1 (Finkelstein, 1994; Soderman et al., 2000); (iii) ethylene signalling mutants, ein2-1, etr1-3 (Guzman and Ecker, 1990; Chang et al., 1993).. The aba2-1 mutant produced a greater number of first order LRs than the wild type in both unstressed and stressed seedlings (Fig. 7A) consistent with the inhibitory role of ABA in LR development. However, NO3--enhanced salt stress stimulation of first order LR proliferation was completely abrogated in this mutant. The slightly weaker aba3-1 mutant (Leon-Kloosterziel et al., 1996) also displayed no significant difference in first order LR number between unstressed and stressed seedlings. The ein2-1 mutant exhibited a similar phenotype to the aba2-1 mutant with greater numbers of first order LRs in unstressed and stressed seedlings but no stimulation of first order LR proliferation in stressed seedlings. By contrast, salt stress stimulated first order LR proliferation in the abi4-1 and etr1-3 mutants. These results suggest that ABA synthesis is required for the first order LR proliferation component of the salt SIMR, that ABI4 is not involved in the signalling network and that at least one factor involved in the ethylene signal network is required.. . Fig. 7.. . ABA and an ethylene signalling factor regulate the LR proliferation component of the NO3--enhanced salt SIMR. (A-D) Seedlings of wild-type, ABA mutants, and ethylene mutants grown on 10 muM KNO3 medium for 4-5 d were transferred to 1 mM KNO3 medium 50 mM NaCl for 12 d. Data are mean SE (n=20). * Significant difference (P 0.01) between unstressed and stressed roots (Tukey's post-hoc test). The data are representative of similar results in three independent experiments.. . . . Figure 7B shows that the response of second order LRs was different from that of first order LRs. Second order LRs were almost only observed in stressed roots in both wild-type and mutant seedlings. Both the aba mutants and the etr1-3 mutant exhibited a similar number of LRs to the wild type, whereas the abi4-1 and ein2-1 mutants displayed greater LR proliferation. These findings suggest that second order LRs are regulated in a different manner to first order LRs.. All the ABA and ethylene signalling mutants exhibited wild-type phenotypes of salt-mediated inhibition of LR and primary root length (Fig. 7C, D) suggesting that the root elongation component of the salt SIMR does not involve ABA or ethylene signalling..
PMC4235297	Results. . Changing dormancy levels following spring burial. Seeds of the winter annual Arabidopsis ecotype Cvi germinate and emerge in the autumn, overwintering as rosettes that flower in early spring. Seed shedding from these overwintered plants in the UK is seen from late April to late May depending on winter/spring temperatures (S. Footitt and W. E. Finch-Savage unpublished). To evaluate the behaviour of the short-lived seed bank represented by this spring to autumn dormancy cycle, primary dormant seeds of the Cvi ecotype were buried in the field in late spring to mimic the natural time of seed dispersal. Before burial in spring seeds were primary dormant, with the depth of dormancy as estimated by the time to 50% after-ripening being c. 44 d (AR50). Following burial, AR50 rapidly declined and by July seed dormancy was at its lowest with only light required to remove the final block to germination (Fig.1). By September, AR50 values increased as dormancy again increased reaching an AR50 value of 83 d when the experiment concluded in November 2008. Changes in AR50 were inversely related to soil temperature (Fig.1a).. . Figure 1. . Seasonal changes in dormancy cycling in spring buried Arabidopsis (Cvi).

The rapid decline in dormancy on burial was reflected in the GA sensitivity of recovered seeds, which increased up until August (Fig.1b). After which, it rapidly declined as dormancy increased to a point where even 250 muM GA gave a minimal response. The magnitude of thermodormancy in seed recovered from the field (Fig.1c) also reflected this changing environmental sensitivity. In general, high-temperature thermodormancy declined to its lowest by August as soil temperature increased. At this time the temperature range permitting germination was at its widest and when this coincided with ambient soil temperature (thermal germination window), the onset of seedling emergence was observed in the field following soil disturbance and exposure to light (Footitt et al., 2011). Germination at 25C was always lowest, but interestingly the relative levels of germination at other temperatures were not consistent and the reason for this is not obvious. Following maximum germination at all temperatures in August, the germination window subsequently closed and thermodormancy rapidly increased as dormancy increased in response to decreasing soil temperature. By September, seeds were almost completely unresponsive to any temperature tested. Over the same period, nitrate sensitivity was maximal during August, after which sensitivity was lost (Fig.2a). At the molecular level, expression of NRT1 and NR1 were high before burial, NRT1 expression declined on burial closely followed by NR1 (Fig.2b).. . Figure 2. .

Gene expression differs in newly dispersed seeds compared to seeds overwintered in the seed bank. We looked for similarities in gene expression during dormancy cycling between seeds overwintered in the seed bank from autumn 2007 (Footitt et al., 2011) and seeds of the same seed lot newly dispersed to the seed bank in spring 2008 (this study). To do this we conducted correlation analysis of gene expression values in the period where the two time-courses overlapped (June-October 2008) and therefore the soil environment was the same in both studies. Only four genes showed significant correlations in their expression patterns; DOG1 (r = 0.96, P < 0.01), ABI5 (r = 0.91, P < 0.05), GA2ox2 (r = 0.92, P < 0.05) and NCED6 (r = 0.85, P < 0.1). This indicates that the response of seeds experiencing shallow dormancy in the summer following spring dispersal differed markedly from those of the same population that had first experienced cycling into deep dormancy during overwintering.. The dormancy-associated gene DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1) had a similar pattern in both overwintered and spring-dispersed seeds (Fig.3a) and is consistently correlated with soil temperature (Table S2). However, the gene, MOTHER OF FLOWERING TIME (MFT) which is significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with dormancy, soil temperature and DOG1 in seeds overwintered in the seed bank (Footitt et al., 2011) has correlations with greatly reduced significance (P > 0.05 < 0.1; Table S2) and a different expression pattern in seeds dispersed in spring (Fig.3b).. .

As dormancy declined the expression of CYP707A2 (ABA catabolism) and GA3ox1 (GA biosynthesis) increased transiently consistent with overwintering in the seed bank (Footitt et al., 2011), then decreased to a low level with a second transient peak of GA3ox1 as dormancy increased in autumn (Fig.4a). Like CYP707A2 and GA3ox1, GID1A (GA receptor) showed an early peak in expression. Subsequently both GID1A and ABI2 (repressor of ABA signalling) had broad peaks of expression from the peak in germination potential (August) to the re-imposition of dormancy in September (Fig.4b). In September, the repressors of GA signalling PIL5 and the DELLA genes RGA2 and RGL2 all peaked, as did the ABA-induced repressor of germination potential ABI5 (Fig.5a,b).. . Figure 4. .

The ABA-signalling genes PYR1 (ABA receptor), ABI4 (repressor of germination potential; Fig.5c) and SPT -a transcription factor of the Phytochrome interacting factor family (Fig.5d) - have large peaks in expression (with a smaller peak for CYP707A2) when seeds are most sensitive to temperature, light and nitrate in August (Fig.1c).. In late spring and summer NCED6 (ABA synthesis) and GA2ox2 (GA catabolism) expression is low, increasing as dormancy subsequently increases from late August (Fig.6a). This is coincident with increased expression of PYL7 (ABA receptor), the SNF1-related protein kinases SnrK 2.1 & 2.4 (positive regulators of ABA signalling that link ABA receptor activity to transcriptional regulators; Nambara et al., 2010) and the transcriptional regulator ABI3 (Fig.6b,c). This pattern is consistent with that of DOG1 with all negatively correlated to soil temperature (Table S2). Interestingly there is also a peak of ABI3 and SnRK2.1 (dormancy promoting) expression immediately after sowing coincident with the transient initial increase in CYP707A2, GID1A and GA3ox1 (dormancy relieving) expression.. .

PMC3539441	ResultsRole of phototropin LOV domains in chloroplast movementTo investigate the function of the two phototropin LOV domains in PHOT1 and PHOT2 on chloroplast movement, we grew the transgenic lines transformed with the wild-type phototropin genes PHOT1 or PHOT2, or these genes with one or both of the two LOV domains inactivated. We measured chloroplast accumulation or avoidance in a central strip across Arabidopsis leaves on illumination with blue light of different fluence rates (Fig. 1). Blue light treatment of any of the four non-transformed lines (gl1, phot1-5/phot2-1, phot 1-5 or phot2-1) produced a response as predicted by the literature (Kagawa et al. 2001, Suetsugu and Wada 2003): whenever PHOT2 was present (gl1 and phot1-5), low fluence rates induced accumulation (above the 0.0 line in the figure) and high fluence rates induced avoidance (below the 0.0 line). The double mutant (phot1-5 phot2-1) was not entirely inactive, but showed a slight accumulation response, probably caused because the phot2-1 mutation is known to be leaky (Cho et al. 2007). With wild-type levels of PHOT1 present (the phot2-1 mutant), accumulation was the only response. The reduced chloroplast accumulation in this line at the highest fluence rate tested could have been caused by the small amount of PHOT2 produced by the leaky phot2-1 mutant which has a point mutation in the splice site juction, in antagonism to the PHOT1-mediated accumulation movement (see Discussion).. Fig. 1Chloroplast movement phenotypes in wild-type (gl1), phot single mutants (phot1-5 and phot2-1), the untransformed double mutant (phot1-5 phot2-1) and representative double mutant phot1-5 phot2-1 seedlings transformed with PHOT expression constructs. Leaves were treated for 30 min at the indicated fluence rates of blue light. Images of the chloroplast movement; a comparison of the darkness of the illuminated strip with that of the covered areas was analyzed by Image J software. Error bars are the SEM. n = 12. The experiment was carried out three times with similar results.Although the various transformant lines selected for this study (1-d, 2-c-1. etc., in fig. 1 from Cho et al. 2007) all expressed mRNA levels equal to or greater than gl1; protein levels as determined by Western blotting were considerably lower than those of the wild type in all cases (Supplementary Fig. S1; fig. 1B in Cho et al. 2007). Nevertheless the results can be interpreted in terms of the levels of the phototropin proteins actually produced by the transformants. When the wild-type PHOT1 gene was transformed into the double mutant (line 1-d), the response was entirely in the direction of accumulation. However, at the highest fluence rate tested, the accumulation response was strongly inhibited. While the protein level for this transformant was below that of PHOT1 in wild-type plants (fig. 1 in Cho et al. 2007), the amount could have been sufficient to allow for at least a partial PHOT2-mediated avoidance response. Alternatively, the presence of functional LOV1 may have suppressed the accumulation response at the highest fluence rate, a mechanism supported by the results of Kaiserli et al. (2009). With the transgene expressing phot1 with only LOV2 functioning (line 2-c-1), the level of protein was sufficient for a strong positive accumulation response. Note that in the absence of LOV1, there is no suppression of the accumulation response in this line, again supporting the mechanism proposed by Kaiserli et al. (2009). Line 3-a (only LOV1 functional) and line 4-a (neither LOV domain functional) both failed to show more than the slight response attributable to a small amount of PHOT2 protein produced in the leaky phot2 mutant. The results above are consistent with other studies indicating the primary role of LOV2 in several physiological responses.As was the case with the PHOT1 transformants, mRNA levels in all of the PHOT2 transformants were equal to or higher than those in wild-type plants (Cho et al. 2007). However, as with the PHOT1 transformants, protein levels were well below those of the gl1 line. Only those plants transformed with the PHOT2 wild-type gene showed some limited chloroplast accumulation (Fig. 1, line 5-d). No complementation was observed for the PHOT1 LOV1 LOV2 plant (line 6-b-2). Indeed, except for the PHOT2 transformant with both LOV domains intact, the weak accumulation response in all of the PHOT2 transformants did not differ from the responses of the phot1 phot2 double mutant. In no case did we observe an avoidance response in the phot2-complemented plants in this experiment. Thus, we hypothesized that in the absence of all PHOT1 and almost all PHOT2, there is likely to be insufficient expression of the transgenic PHOT2, plus a trace of the wild-type protein, to mediate an avoidance response. It could be that the avoidance response is not activated until the accumulation response is saturated-by either or both phototropins.To test this hypothesis, we carried out Western blot analysis and chloroplast movement experiments for lines 5-a, 5-c and 5-d from Cho et al. (2007) that had all been transformed with the fully functional PHOT2 gene. These lines all showed mRNA levels above those for wild-type PHOT2 plants (Cho et al. 2007). Line 5-c showed the highest expression both of the phot2 transgene (fig. 1C in Cho et al. 2007) and of the PHOT2 protein (Fig. 2). Not surprisingly, line 5-a was no different from the phot1 phot2 double mutant and failed to show any chloroplast response (Fig. 3). Line 5-d showed slight accumulation at both light intensities, somewhat above that shown by the double mutant. However, line 5-c, with its higher expression level (Fig. 2), actually showed a significant avoidance response at the higher fluence rate (Fig. 3). Evidently the levels of PHOT2 protein present were sufficient for an avoidance response in this case. Note that line 5-c (Fig. 2) shows two bands. This is also the case for lines 7-a, 8-a-2 and 8-c-2 (Supplementary Fig. S1). All of these lines show expression of mRNA well above the basal level seen in the phot1 phot2 double mutant. We attribute the lower band to leaky expression of the wild-type gene. We suggest that the protein from the transgene is fully phosphorylated whereas the leaked protein from the mutant gene is not. The separation is what we would expect if the difference is the consequence of differential phosphorylation (see Cho et al. 2007, fig. 7, lanes 2 and 4 to compare unphosphorylated and phosphorylated phot2.. Fig. 2Western blots of membrane fractions prepared from seven different Arabidopsis lines and probed with anti-PHOT2 antibody. Note that the transformant lines 5-a, 5-c and 5-d express levels of PHOT2 far below those of the wild type (gl1) or phot1-5. Lines 5-a and 5-d do not appear to express more protein than the phot1 phot2 double mutant although line 5-d does show some limited complementation (see text).. Fig. 3Quantitative representation of chloroplast movements in the seven lines shown in Fig. 2 in response to blue light. The two fluence rates were chosen so that the lower one induced an accumulation response and the higher one induced an avoidance response in wild-type (gl1) leaves. Of the three transformant lines, only line 5-c shows an avoidance response. Error bars are the SEM. n = 12. The experiment was carried out three times with similar results.Note that line 5-c (both LOV domains intact) also complemented the leaf flattening response (Fig. 4, Table 1), whereas lines 5-a and 5-d both failed to do so. Cho et al. (2007) did obtain partial complementation of flattening with line 5-d, possibly because their plants were slightly younger than ours. In addition, in their hands, line 5-d showed complete complementation for PHOT2-mediated phototropism of etiolated hypocotyls. Thus the level of PHOT2 protein expression in the etiolated hypocotyl of line 5-d is sufficient for phototropism whereas the level in the leaves is insufficient for complete leaf flattening..

Fig. 4Leaf shapes of the transformed plants with the PHOT2 LOV1 LOV2 construct. Only line 5-c complements the leaf-flattening response.Role of the LOV domain in leaf positioningTo optimize photosynthesis, plants are capable of responding to blue light by appropriate leaf positioning (Takemiya et al. 2005). We characterized the leaf-positioning phenotypes of the selected PHOT LOV transgenic lines as previously described (Inoue et al. 2008). These plants were irradiated with white light (100 mol m-2 s-1) from above for 24 h. Not surprisingly leaf orientation was normal in the wild type (gl1) and in both phot2-1 and phot1-5. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the first true leaves were oriented horizontally, at right angles to the incident white light in these three lines. As expected, the double mutant phot1-5 phot 2-1 lacked normal leaf positioning. Fig. 6 shows the quantitative data for the controls and the various transformant lines. Among the transformants, the PHOT1 wild-type gene (line 1-d) and PHOT1 LOV1 LOV2 transgenic line (line 2-c-1) both showed complementation, and line 3-a showed partial complementation. However, neither the PHOT1 LOV1 LOV2 gene (line 3-a) nor the PHOT1 LOV1LOV2 gene (line 4-a) provided normal leaf positioning in response to white light. Although line 7-a showed partial complementation of hypocotyl phototropism (fig. 3B in Cho et al. 2007), it failed to complement the leaf positioning response. This observation is consistent with our results (Fig. 1) indicating that LOV1 in PHOT2 does not complement the chloroplast movement response. These different apparent sensitivities suggest that different phototropin levels may be required for the different responses. Note that lines 5-a and 5-d, both expressing detectable amounts of the transformant protein (Fig. 2), complement the leaf positioning phenotype less than line 5-c. Since none of the other transgenic lines showed complementation, probably because of low protein expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S1), little can be said about the role of LOV2 in PHOT2 for this response.. Fig. 5Leaf positioning of wild-type, phot1, phot2 and phot1 phot2 mutants of Arabidopsis grown under white light. Normal leaf positioning was induced by illumination with white light (35 mol m-2) for 24 h. This experiment was carried out three times with 12 plants, each time with similar results.. Fig. 6Quantitation of the leaf positioning results. In the mutants and the transformants, the higher the angles between the leaf blades and the petioles, the smaller the positioning response and the weaker the complementation. This experiment was carried out twice with similar results. In all cases, n = 15 or above. Error bars are the SEM.Red light effects on chloroplast movementA recent study reported that brief pulses of red light given 2 h prior to phototropic induction by low fluence rates of blue light could prevent the movement of PHOT1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm in etiolated Arabidopsis seedling, and that this retention of PHOT1-GFP may contribute to the red light-induced enhancement in phototropic response to blue light (Han et al. 2008). This red light-induced increase in phototropic sensitivity was shown to be mediated by phyA and not by phyB. It was necessary to interpose a 2 h dark period between the red light pulse and the blue light treatment in order to obtain the full phytochrome effect. Thus we tested whether there might be a similar red light effect on the chloroplast movement responses induced by blue light.Plants dark-adapted for at least 1.5 h as for the chloroplast experiments above were given a pulse of red light and then kept in the dark for 2 h prior to blue light treatment. Fig. 7A shows that a red light pulse (100 mol m-2) prior to exposure to low-fluence blue light significantly increases chloroplast accumulation in both phot1-5 and phot2-1 plants. Chloroplast movement after blue light treatment was quantified as before. If the effect of red light is indeed phytochrome mediated, it should be at least partially far-red reversible. We treated leaves with red light as above followed immediately by 1,260 mol m-2 of far-red light. The far-red light reversed the enhanced chloroplast accumulation by the red light (Fig. 7A). The enhancement and its reversal occurred whether the accumulation response was activated by PHOT1 or by PHOT2. To examine the effect of red light on the chloroplast avoidance response, we used the wild type (gl1) and also phot1-5 (because only PHOT2 contributes to the avoidance response). Although the effect of red light on chloroplast avoidance was marginal (Fig. 7B), subsequent far-red light clearly reduced the avoidance response. Thus, both the accumulation and avoidance results show far-red reversibility and hence phytochrome participation (Fig. 7).. Fig. 7Red light enhances chloroplast movement and its effect is reversed by far-red light. Leaves were treated with the indicated fluence rate of blue light. Quantitative representation of the chloroplast movement. Light-grown Arabidopsis plants 3-4 weeks old were dark adapted for 1.5 h before red light treatment: either red light alone (R) (10 mol m-2 for 10 s) or red light (10 mol m-2 for 10 s) followed immediately by far-red (FR) (42 mol m-2 for 30 s). A 2 h dark incubation period followed the red or red/far-red treatment prior to blue light (B) treatment (either 1 or 45 mol m-2 s-1 for chloroplast accumulation or avoidance, respectively). (A) Chloroplast accumulation during 30 min low fluence rate blue light (1 mol m-2 s-1). (B) Chloroplast avoidance during 30 min high fluence rate blue light (45 mol m-2 s-1). Images of chloroplast movement were analyzed by Image J software as described for Fig. 1. Error bars are the SEM. n = 12 or more. The experiment was carried out three times with similar results.To test whether the red light-enhanced chloroplast movement induced by blue light was mediated by phyA or phyB, we tested the phytochrome-deficient mutants phyA-211 or phyB-9 (Reed et al. 1993, Reed et al. 1994) for the enhancement of blue light-induced chloroplast accumulation by red light. Fig. 8 shows that whereas red light was fully effective in enhancing chloroplast accumulation, this effect was fully reversed by immediate subsequent far-red light in phyB-deficient plants. However, any effect of red light alone or red light followed by far-red light was absent in phyA-deficient plants. Hence, chloroplast accumulation in response to blue light is enhanced by phyA-mediated red light pre-treatment, as is the case for hypocotyl phototropism (Han et al. 2008), but not by phyB.. Fig. 8Red light inhibition of blue light-induced chloroplast accumulation is mediated by phyA. (A) In the absence of phyA, red light fails to enhance blue light-induced chloroplast accumulation. (B) In the absence of phyB, red light is fully effective in enhancing blue light-induced chloroplast accumulation. Irradiation and dark incubation protocols as in Fig. 6.

PMC4231032	Results. . Phylogenetic analysis, subcellular localization, and expression pattern of GhSnRK2 in cotton plant. The phylogenetic tree constructed using the full length amino acid sequence of selected SnRK2 genes to analyze the evolutionary relationship between GhSnRK2 and other SnRK2 family genes is shown in the neighbor-joining tree developed based on an alignment of the complete protein sequences. The bootstrap values are shown on the branches. GhSnRK2 clustered with the known stress-related genes AtSnRK2.1, AED91326.1; AtSnRK2.4, AEE28666.1; AtSnRK2.5, AED97781.1; AtSnRK2.10, AEE33751.1; and Oryza sativa (RK1), ABB89146.1. SnRK2.10 and SnRK2.4 are closely related to GhSnRK2, suggesting that GhSnRK2 belongs to the SnRK2 family (Figure 1A). Alignment of the GhSnRK2 amino acid sequence with that of other SnRK2s revealed that the GhSnRK2 protein is highly similar to other SnRK2s; the relatively conserved motif is underlined. The deduced amino acid sequence displays relatively high homology with the monocot SnRK2 family members Oryza sativa (RK1), ABB89146 and with the dicot species AtSnRK2.10, AEE33751.1 (Figure S1A). The GhSnRK2-GFP fusion protein driven by the CaMV 35S promoter was transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells, and the green fluorescent GhSnRK2 protein signals were localized to the nuclei and the cytoplasm, whereas GFP alone was detected throughout the cell (Figure1B). qRT-PCR was performed to quantify the expression level of the GhSnRK2 gene. Treatment of 3-week-old CCRI24 upland cotton cultivar plants with 10% PEG for different periods induced the expression of the GhSnRK2 gene for 3 h, after which the expression level declined (n=3) (Figure 1C). To investigate the distribution of GhSnRK2 in different tissues, samples from root (RT), stem (ST), cauline leaves (CL), rosette leaves (RL) and flowers (FL) were analyzed. GhSnRK2 gene expression was detected in all of the examined tissues in distinct expression patterns and was highest in the root and lowest in the flower, suggesting that the GhSnRK2 gene may most actively function in the root (Figure 1D). Cotton histone3 (gene accession AF024716) was used as internal control to normalize expression data. The values are presented as the means of three replicates, and the error bars denote the SE.

Plant transformation vector and the expression pattern of the GhSnRK2 gene in the transgenic lines. The schematic representation of the 35S-GhSnRK2 construct used for Arabidopsis transformation (Figure 2A). The full-length GhSnRK2 cDNA was introduced into the Arabidopsis genome via the floral dip method using Agrobacterium GV3101; the XbaI-BamHI region of GhSnRK2 was inserted between the CaMV 35S promoter and the nopaline synthase gene terminator in the pCAMBIA2301 vector to generate the recombinant plasmid 35S-GhSnRK2-NOST. The neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII) gene, driven by the nopaline synthase gene promoter (NOSP), was carried by the pCAMBIA2301 vector for transgenic cell selection in kanamycin-containing LB medium. GhSnRK2 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants was confirmed by PCR analysis. Genomic DNA from the first generation of the plants (T1) was extracted and used as a template for gene-specific primers. Of the 43 plants evaluated, 35 were positive for GhSnRK2 amplification. No product was formed by the amplification reaction using untransformed plant DNA as the template (Figure S2B). At T1 generation, the ratio of dead to surviving plants was approximately 13 in kanamycin-containing LB medium. However, at T3 generation, all of the plants became homozygous, as their survival rate was 100% in kanamycin-containing LB medium (Figure S2A, Table S1). The values are expressed as the mean germination rate (%) of approximately 200 seeds. qRT-PCR analysis was performed to evaluate the differences in transgene expression between all of the independently generated transgenic lines. Various transgene expression patterns were detected in the transgenic lines overexpressing the GhSnRK2 gene, but no expression was detected in the WT line, indicating that the GhSnRK2 genes were successfully introduced into the transformed plants (Figure 2B). The values are presented as the means of three experimental replicates; the error bars indicate the standard deviations. AtACT2 (gene accession At3G18780) was used as internal control to normalize expression data.

To investigate the roles of GhSnRK2 in stress response pathways, the responses of the three selected transgenic GhSnRK2-overexpressing Arabidopsis lines to drought and low temperature stresses were analyzed. Constitutive overexpression of the 35S-GhSnRK2 gene resulted in an increase in the drought tolerance of the transgenic plants. After withholding water for 9 days, some of the WT plants grew slowly, wilted severely and died, whereas few of the GhSnRK2 transgenic plants wilted. The recovery rate of the transgenic plants was higher than that of the WT plants after re-watering. Indeed, the survival rate was significantly different between the GhSnRK2 transgenic and wild-type plants: L2 (100%), L4 (94.4%), L1 (88.9%), and WT (4.4%); Student's T-test (n=3) (p<0.05) (Figure 3A, B). These results suggested that the GhSnRK2 gene is involved in the response to drought tolerance.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0112269.g003. Figure 3. . Survival rates of GhSnRK2 transgenic plants under drought and low temperature stresses.. (A) WT and GhSnRK2 transgenic plants before and after drought stress. (B) Seedlings were cultured for 2 weeks with constant watering before the withholding of water. After 9 days without water, all of the plants were irrigated, and plant re-growth was scored 4 days later. The plants were scored as survivors if there were healthy green young leaves after re-watering. The survival rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of surviving plants to the total number of treated plants in the flower pot. Asterisk denotes a significant difference (P<0.05). (C) WT and GhSnRK2 transgenic plants before and after low temperature stress. (D) Survival rates under low temperature stress conditions.

Clearly green plants after returning to the normal growth condition were scored as survivors, and plants exhibiting clear signs of wilting were denoted as dead. The mean survival rates of the WT line were compared with those of the transgenic lines using Student's T-test. (E) The water use efficiency of the WT and GhSnRK2 transgenic plants. Asterisk denotes a significant difference (P<0.05).. . . . Under low temperature stress conditions, the survival rate of the transgenic lines was significantly higher than that of the WT line. Most of the transgenic plants were intact and recovered from this stress, whereas most WT plants were found to have died and could not recover after transferring them to the normal growth conditions. The survival rates at 4C were: WT (16.67%), L2 (80.55%), L1 (77.78%), and L4 (78.33%). The survival rates at -4C were: WT (5.56%), L1 (54.44%), L2 (58.33%), and L4 (56.11%). At -8C, only 3.3% of the WT plants survived, whereas the survival rates of transgenic lines ranged between 30% and 33.33% after 7 days under normal growth conditions (Figure 3C, D). However, the survival rate under different low temperatures clearly indicates the difference between the transgenic and WT plants, suggesting that the GhSnRK2 overexpression alleviates low temperature stress in transgenic Arabidopsis. Our findings revealed that the water use efficiency was higher in GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants compared to the corresponding WT plants, suggesting that GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants exhibit greater photosynthetic potential during drought stress treatment (Figure 3E). Normal turgor pressure which is regulated by the amount of water in the plant's cells is required for healthy growth of a plant and is a powerful determinant of the plant's drought tolerance. We determined the turgor of the GhSnRK2 transgenic plant to understand the role of turgor pressure in cellular signaling during water deficit condition. Turgor values of GhSnRK2 transgenic plant was notably higher compared to the corresponding WT plant and this may be attributable to osmotic adjustment, like stomatal closure, and the maintenance of water content which prevent plants from desiccation and turgor loss. Student's T-test (n=3) (p<0.05) (Figure 3F).. . . Biochemical and physiological assays of plants overexpressing the GhSnRK2 gene. The rate of water loss and the RWC were investigated to further understand the tolerance of GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants to water stress via the maintenance of a higher RWC and a reduced rate of water loss. Our results revealed that due to their smaller stomata aperture, the transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the GhSnRK2 gene lost water more slowly than the WT plant in the same period under normal conditions, which may underlie the capacity of the transgenic plants to maintain a higher leaf RWC and to tolerate water stress conditions; tstat>t Critical two-tail (Figure 4A). The GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants exhibited a higher RWC than the WT plants, which is most likely due to the reduction in transpiration-mediated water loss. The RWCs in each line were L2(74.56%), L4(72.09%), L1 (70.04%), and WT (53.98%); Student's T-test (n=3) (p<0.05) (Figure 4B). It is known that during the plant response to abiotic stress, stomata typically close to reduce the rate of water loss due to transpiration. Moreover, abscisic acid (ABA) regulates the stomatal aperture under water-deficient conditions. We found that the stomata apertures of the GhSnRK2 transgenic plants in response to exogenous ABA treatment were smaller than those of the WT plants, indicating the protective effect of the GhSnRK2 protein in response to ABA. At 0 m ABA, the stomata aperture of the WT plants was observed slightly wider than that of the GhSnRK2 transgenic plants. However, when the concentration of ABA was increased to 1 m, the aperture size of the transgenic plants was significantly reduced. A similar pattern was detected at 5 m ABA (n=5) (Figure 4C, D). Free proline is an osmoprotective molecule that accumulates under stress conditions. Our results revealed that the proline contents of the GhSnRK2 transgenic lines were significantly higher than those of the WT line, indicating that the transgenic plants accumulate a higher amount of proline than the WT plants. Moreover, the upregulation of Arabidopsis pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1, a proline biosynthesis gene, in GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants suggested that proline production may be improved by GhSnRK2 via the regulation of proline biosynthesis genes; Student's T-test (n=3) (p<0.05) (Figure 4E). Greater leaf chlorophyll content at all stages of plant development has been associated with improved transpiration efficiency under drought stress, and this trait may indicate the presence of drought avoidance mechanisms. Based on our results, the chlorophyll content of the GhSnRK2 transgenic lines was higher than that of the WT line, suggesting that GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants exhibit greater photosynthetic potential (p<0.05) (Figure 4F).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0112269.g004.

Overexpression of GhSnRK2 in transgenic plants enhances seedling growth in response to NaCl and exogenous ABA treatment. To investigate the effect of GhSnRK2 overexpression in response to NaCl and exogenous ABA treatment, a root growth experiment was conducted to elucidate the physiological differences between the transgenic and WT plants. The transgenic plants overexpressing GhSnRK2 exhibited enhanced seedling growth under NaCl and ABA stress treatments, suggesting that GhSnRK2 may be involved in the oxidative stress response pathway. Seedlings of WT and GhSnRK2 transgenic lines grew normally in 0 mM NaCl. In 100 mM and 150 mMNaCl, the transgenic seedlings formed longer roots and displayed significantly larger growth than the WT seedlings. When the NaCl concentration was increased to 200 mm, the growth of the WT seedlings was completely inhibited, and the color of these seedlings was found to have turned brownish, whereas the transgenic seedlings remained green and continued to grow, although at a slower rate (n=3) (Figure 5A, B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0112269.g005. Figure 5. . Seedling growth of the WT and GhSnRK2-overexpressing lines in response to NaCl and ABA treatment.. (A) WT and GhSnRK2 transgenic plants subjected to different concentrations of NaCl. (B) Approximately one-week-old seedlings were transferred to 1/2MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl; the root length was measured after 7 days. Each of the three biological replicates consisted of 16 plants. The mean values were compared using Student's T-test (p<0.05). (C) The root growth of the WT and GhSnRK2 transgenic plants treated with different concentrations of ABA. (D) The plants were cultured vertically on MS-containing medium treated with different concentrations of ABA (0.5 m, 1 m, or 2 m); the root length was measured after 7 days. Each of the three biological replicates consisted of 16 plants. Student's T-test was used to compare the mean values of the WT and transgenic lines. Asterisk denotes a significant difference (P<0.05).. . . . The seedlings from the WT and GhSnRK2-overexpressing lines cultured under normal conditions displayed no significant difference. However, when various concentrations of ABA (0.5 m, 1 m, or 2 m) were introduced to the MS medium and the plants were allowed to grow vertically, the root growth of the GhSnRK2-overexpressing lines, although slightly inhibited, displayed greater elongation than the WT line, the root growth of which was severely inhibited (n=3). These results indicated that GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to ABA than the WT plants (Figure 5C, D).. . . GhSnRK2 overexpression in transgenic plants enhances seed germination in response to NaCl and exogenous ABA treatment. We investigated the germination of GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants under exogenous ABA and salt stresses to determine whether GhSnRK2 is involved in stress response pathways. The germination rates of WT and GhSnRK2-overexpressing seeds were similar at 0 mM NaCl and ABA. However, when different concentrations of ABA or NaCl were introduced, the germination of the WT and GhSnRK2-overexpressing seeds was inhibited. When 50 mM NaCl was introduced to the MS medium, the germination rate was 47% for the WT line and 85%, 89%, and 86% for the L1, L2, and L4 lines, respectively. At100 mM NaCl, the germination rates were: WT (20.5%), L1(52%), L2 (56%), and L4 (54%)(Figure 6A, B). These results suggested that the GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt stress than the corresponding WT plants. ABA plays a prominent role in the regulation of germinating and post-germinating growth arrest and mediates the adaptation of the plant to stress. To investigate this hypothesis, we measured the response of GhSnRK2-overexpressing plants to different concentrations of ABA during the germination stage. At 0.3 m ABA the seed germination rates were WT (45%), L1 (69%), L2 (73%), and L4 (70%), respectively. When the concentration of ABA was increased to 0.5 m, the germination rate of the WT line was clearly reduced (27%), whereas the germination rate of the transgenic lines ranged from 43% to 48% (Figure 6A, C). In summary, our findings revealed that the GhSnRK2-overexpressing mutants were more tolerant to NaCl and exogenous ABA stresses than the corresponding WT plants. Student's t-test was used to compare the mean germination rates. Asterisks denote a significant difference compared to the control (P0.05).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0112269.g006. Figure 6. .

(E) Fresh weight biomass of GhSnRK2 transgenic plants and corresponding WT plants. The fresh weight of the roots and shoots was measured immediately after harvesting. Each of the three biological replicates consisted of 12 plants. Student's T-test was performed. Asterisk denotes a significant difference (P<0.05).. . . . We further investigated the biomass accumulation of GhSnRK2 transgenic and WT plants. The transgenic plants exhibited highly significant increases in both the fresh and dry weight biomasses compared with the corresponding WT plants (Figure 6D, E). These increases were all statistically significant; suggesting that overexpression of the GhSnRk2 gene increases biomass accumulation in plants. The increased biomass accumulation may be attributable to the increased chlorophyll content in GhSnRK2 overexpressing plant, as chlorophyll in plant cells carries out the bulk of energy fixation in the process of photosynthesis and is probably the most-often used estimator of plant biomass.. . . Expression analysis of stress-responsive marker genes. To further elucidate the biological function and molecular mechanisms of the GhSnRK2 gene, we determined the transcript levels of several stress-associated genes in GhSnRK2-overexpressing lines. Seedlings from 10-day-old GhSnRK2 transgenic and WT Arabidopsis lines cultured in MS medium were in the presence or absence of NaCl (250 mM) for 2 h. qRT-PCR was performed as described in the Materials and Methods section. Our findings revealed that GhSnRK2 regulates the expression levels of ABA and stress-responsive marker genes, suggesting that GhSnRK2 may positively affect ABA signaling and plant stress responses. The expression levels of C-repeat binding factor-1 (AtCBF1; accession: ABV27087), delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylatesynthase-1 (AtP5CS1; accession:NP001189715), protein abscisic acid-insensitive-5 (AtABI5; accession:NP565840), protein abscisic acid-insensitive-3 (AtABI3; accession:CAA48241), desiccation-responsive genes (Atrd29B; accession: BAA02375 and Atrd29A; accession:BAA02376) in the GhSnRK2-overexpressing lines were significantly higher than those of the WT lines (p0.05), revealing that GhSnRK2 is actively involved in stress signaling pathways (Figure 7).

The vertical axis displays the expression pattern. Three biological replicates produced similar results.. . . . . . VIGS efficiency and the transcript level of GhSnRK2 in gene silenced plants. We employed the VIGS technique to further dissect the function of the GhSnRK2 gene in transgenic cotton. The TRV VIGS vectors were modified based on a pTRV1 containing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), movement protein (MP), a 16 kDa cysteine-rich protein (16K), CaMV 35S promoters (2X35S) and a NOS terminator (NOSt) T-DNA vector. pTRV2 contains the coat protein (CP), multiple cloning sites (MCSs), CaMV 35S promoters (2X35S) and a NOS terminator (NOSt) T-DNA vector. Both vectors contain Rz, which is designated as a self-cleaving ribozyme, LB (left border) and RB (right border) of the T-DNA (Figure S1B). After inoculating Agrobacterium strains containing GhSnRK2 derivatives (PYL156: (pTRV-RNA2)-GhSnRk2, PYL192:(pTRV-RNA1), PYL156:(pTRV-RNA2)-GhCLA1 (positive control), or PYL156:(pTRV-RNA2) vector) into Gossypium hirsutum leaves, the phenotype of both silenced and non-silenced plants was monitored daily for gene silencing efficiency. Loss of normal green coloration in plant leaves and albino phenotype was detected in PYL156:(pTRV-RNA2)-GrCLA1 silenced plants, which served as the positive control indicating gene silencing efficiency. The GrCLA1 gene represents the ideal visual marker for gene silencing efficiency due to its involvement in chloroplast development, as its loss of function results in an albino phenotype in true leaves (Figure 8A). The transcript levels of GhSnRK2 in gene silenced and non-silenced plants were analyzed via qRT-PCR. The transcript level of GhSnRK2 in the gene silenced two plant cultivars were downregulated compared to the non-silence plants inoculated with empty vector and WT plants, which exhibited a higher expression level. The downregulation of GhSnRK2 indicated that the gene was successfully knocked down in the silenced plants (Figure 8B). qRT-PCR analysis of the distribution of the TRV-construct in the silenced plants revealed that its infection results in gene-specific transcript degradation, that pTRV-GhSnRK2 functions in diverse tissues, and that pTRV-GhSnRK2 is abundantly expressed in the root. The roots of gene silenced plants exhibited further down regulated expression levels compared to the stems and the leaves. The TRV-construct displays increased infectivity and meristem invasion, both of which are key requirements for efficient VIGS-based functional characterization of genes in root tissues (Figure 8C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0112269.g008.

The values are presented as the means of three biological replicates. Asterisk denotes a significant difference (P<0.05).. . . . . . Physiological assay and responses of GhSnRK2 gene silenced plants to various stresses. To further elucidate the function of the GhSnRK2 gene in stress tolerance, we investigated the response of GhSnRK2gene silenced plants to various stresses. Our findings validated the importance of this technique for stress tolerance studies. Under water-deficient conditions, the silenced plants wilted and drooped, regardless of the cultivar (Figure 9A). The phenotype of the non-silenced plants inoculated with empty vector (TRV) was indistinguishable from that of the WT plants. The two cotton cultivars (CRI99668 and CRI409) inoculated with the target gene displayed similar phenotypes and symptoms. The WT and control vector-treated plant survival rates were 80% and 77.3%, respectively, whereas the survival rate of the two gene silenced cotton cultivars (CRI99668 and CRI409) were 34.66% and 38.67%, respectively (Figure 9B). Student's T-test revealed a significant difference (p<0.05) between the survival rate of the gene silenced and non-silenced plants. The rate of water loss from the detached leaves was determined in both the gene silenced and non-silenced plants (Figure 9C). After monitoring the water loss for 6-h, we found that the GhSnRK2 gene silenced plants inoculated lost more water than the non-silenced plants inoculated with empty vector and the WT plants. The rate of water loss was slightly higher in the CRI99668 cultivars than in the CRI409 cultivars. Under similar conditions, the gene silenced plants, regardless of the cultivar, exhibited a substantially reduced water content compared with the non-silenced plants inoculated with empty vector and the WT plants (Figure 9D). Oxidative stress, including that mediated by salinity, alters the physiological and morphological responses of plants. To investigate the effect of salt stress on GhSnRK2 gene silenced plants, the gene silenced and non-silenced plants were treated with 150 mM NaCl for 7 days, and the effect of NaCl was measured following this stress. Our findings revealed that the chlorophyll content of the non-silenced plants was higher than that of the gene silenced plants, indicating that the GhSnRK2 gene may be involved in the oxidative stress response (Figure 9E). Growth retardation was detected in the GhSnRK2 silenced plants, and the effect of salt accumulation in the plant cells was detected as elevated blisters, which were visibly detectable on the leaf surface of GhSnRK2 gene silenced plants (Figure 9F).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0112269.g009.

PMC3991740	Results. . Secondary screens identify distinct classes of lateral root mutants. Increased formation of lateral roots is a commonly reported phenotype in Arabidopsis mutants. Therefore, it is useful to have a pipeline to categorize mutants into subgroups representing known mechanisms for increased lateral root formation. Such a pipeline is described here for a group of eight mutants that were isolated with increased lateral root formation, and which were rescreened for lateral root emergence mutants of interest.. The mutant screen used conditions demonstrated in Deak and Malamy (2005) and Macgregor et al. (2008) to strongly repress lateral root formation. For this laboratory assay, repressive conditions were defined as 1 MS basal salts with 20mM each KNO3 and NH4NO3, 4.5% sucrose, and low light (50-60 mumol). Seedlings grown under these repressive conditions have been previously reported to show a dramatic decrease in lateral root formation compared with seedlings grown under control conditions (control conditions were defined as 1 MS basal salts, 5mM each KNO3 and NH4NO3 and 1% sucrose, and low light (50-60 mumol) (Macgregor et al., 2008). Seedlings from 100 pools of T-DNA mutagenized lines in the Wassilewskija (Ws) background (Feldmann, 1991; ABRC CS84441) were screened. This work identified eight mutants that showed a robust increase in lateral root formation on repressive conditions as compared to the wild type (Ws; see Fig. 1A for examples).. . Fig. 1.. . Characterization of eight mutants with increased lateral root formation compared to the wild type (Ws). (A) Three mutants showing increased lateral root formation after 15 d of growth on repressive conditions. (B) Total lateral root length for eight mutant lines compared to the wild type grown on repressive media for 15 d: all show a statistically significant increase compared to the wild type (P<0.01, Students paired t-test). (C) Mutant grown on parafilm to prevent contact between aerial tissues and media, continuing to show the lateral root phenotype. (D) Total lateral root length for eight mutant lines grown on repressive media for 18 d with aerial tissue isolated from media by parafilm; stars indicate statistically significant increases compared to the wild type (P<0.05, Students paired t-test). (E) Total lateral root length for eight mutant lines grown on control media for 14 d: mutants 001-005 show an increase in lateral root formation, mutants 006, 007 and 023 show a decrease in lateral root formation; stars indicate statistically significant differences compared to the wild type (P<0.05, Students paired t-test). Data are meanstandard error (n= 22-34).. . . . Lateral root formation is repressed under these screening conditions due to a number of factors. One factor is that osmotic potential affects the permeability of the aerial tissues to sucrose in the media, with lower osmotic potential reducing sucrose uptake and thereby reducing lateral root formation (Macgregor et al., 2008). Another factor is osmotic repression of the overall growth rate of the plant or of the shoot system, which may exert an indirect effect on growth of the root system (Roycewicz and Malamy, 2012). Additionally, high levels of nitrate in the media have a repressive effect on lateral root formation that is independent of osmolarity, shoot growth, or shoot permeability to media sucrose (Roycewicz and Malamy, 2012). Based on this information, it is possible to predict five types of mechanisms that would allow a mutant to exhibit an increase in lateral root formation in this assay system: (1) increased permeability to media sucrose at the shoot, as has previously been shown for mutants in cuticle formation (Macgregor et al., 2008); (2) constitutive increase in shoot system or whole plant growth rates; (3) reduction in nitrate-mediated repression of lateral root formation; (4) specific increase in lateral root formation independent of shoot growth; and (5) some other process is altered in a way that has yet to be uncovered. Mutants of type 4 would most likely lead to a greater understanding of the lateral root emergence process, and isolating such mutants was therefore the goal of this study.. To characterize the mutants, the average total length of all lateral roots was first determined for each line. As expected, each of the eight mutant lines identified showed a statistically significant increase in total lateral root length compared to wild type (Ws) when grown under repressive conditions for 15 d (Fig. 1A, B).. To identify type 1 mutants that overcame repression of lateral root formation via an increase in sucrose uptake by the shoot, this study investigated whether each mutant still showed a lateral root phenotype under repressive conditions with parafilm blocking aerial tissue contact with media sucrose, as in Macgregor et al. (2008). Five out of the eight mutants still showed a significant and reproducible increase in lateral root formation when shoots were isolated on parafilm (Fig. 1C, D), indicating that their phenotype did not depend on sucrose uptake from the media. In contrast, it is likely that mutants 001, 002, and 004 had increased lateral root formation due to increased sucrose uptake at the leaves.. Next, all eight mutants were grown under control conditions to see if any of the mutants had a growth condition-specific phenotype (i.e. ability to overcome low osmotic potential or high nitrate repression). Wild-type (Ws) seedlings grown under control conditions formed numerous lateral roots at 2 weeks of age. Interestingly, the eight mutant lines separated into two groups when grown under control conditions (Fig. 1E). Five mutants (001-005) showed an increase in lateral root formation compared to Ws under control conditions (although due to the high variability of lateral root formation on this condition, only three could be confirmed as being significantly different). Mutants 001, 002, and 004 were suggested to have increased sucrose uptake from the media under low osmotic potential (type 1), and increased lateral root formation under all conditions is consistent with that idea. Interestingly, mutants 006, 007, and 023 grown on control media showed a significant decrease in lateral root formation compared to wild type (Ws). Opposite phenotypes on the two growth conditions is not predicted for mutants of types 2, 3, or 4, and therefore these three mutants must have defects in a novel, environmentally responsive regulatory mechanism (type 5).. Mutants 003 and 005 became the focus of further investigation, as they had the potential to be type 4 mutants (defects specific to the lateral root formation process). To determine whether they were indeed type 4 or were exhibiting lateral root phenotypes due to increases in shoot or overall plant growth rates (type 2), shoot systems were examined. Both mutants 003 and 005 (as well as all others mutants described here) appeared to have an increased shoot size when examined visually (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1 available at JXB online). To confirm this observation, seedlings were quantified for chlorophyll content using A. 430 as a proxy for shoot size (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. S2 available at JXB online). All mutants exhibited a significant increase in shoot size (Fig. 2A). To test whether root and shoot system sizes in mutants 003 and 005 are always correlated, or whether an increase in lateral root formation per unit shoot size could be found, mutants were grown on media with varying amounts of sucrose. Reducing the sucrose content in the culture media modulates the size of aerial tissues. In each medium, sucrose was replaced with an equivalent amount of the non-metabolizable sugar mannitol (to maintain a constant osmotic potential). For both mutants, reducing the concentration of sucrose resulted in seedlings with smaller or similar shoot sizes compared to Ws seedlings grown under repressive conditions (Fig. 2B, C, right panels). However, even when manipulation of the media lead to mutant plants with a smaller shoot size than Ws, the mutants still exhibited a higher total lateral root length than the Ws seedlings on repressive media (Fig. 2B, C, left panels). These results confirm that both mutants 003 and 005 are capable of forming more lateral roots per unit shoot size. Type 2 mutants are predicted to have a correlated increase in shoot and root growth, either due to an overall increase in the whole plant growth rate or an indirect effect of increased shoot growth on root growth. Thus 003 and 005 are not type 2 mutants, but rather demonstrate a root-specific phenotype, as predicted for type 4 mutants.. . Fig. 2.. . Shoot size and total lateral root length for mutants and the wild type (Ws) grown on repressive media and media with reduced sucrose and compensating mannitol content. (A) Shoot size for eight mutant lines compared to the wild type grown on repressive media for 15 d: all show a statistically significant increase compared to Ws (P<0.01, Students paired t-test). (B) Mutant 003 shows a significantly reduced shoot size (left panel) and a significantly increased total lateral root length (right panel) at 120 and 90mM sucrose when compared to the wild type (stars, P<0.01, Students paired t-test). (C) Mutant 005 shows a significantly reduced shoot size at 120mM sucrose (right panel) and significantly increased total lateral root length (left panel) (stars, P<0.01, Students paired t-test) compared to the wild type. Data are meanstandard error (n=16-35).. . . . . . Mutation in At2g35610 is responsible for lateral root phenotype in mutant 005 (lrd5-1). Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR was employed to identify the genomic location of the T-DNA insertion in mutants 003 and 005. No T-DNA was found in the 003 line either by PCR or by Southern blot analysis (not shown). However, two genomic sequences were obtained from TAIL-PCR of mutant 005, corresponding to At2g35610 and At1g20640. Segregation analysis was performed in order to determine whether either of the T-DNA insertions identified cosegregated with the mutant phenotype. The mutant was crossed to the parental background (Ws) and the resulting F1 progeny were allowed to self-fertilize. None of the F1 progeny showed a mutant phenotype, indicating that the mutation was recessive. The F2 progeny were screened for mutant phenotype, and were tested via PCR using primers specific for each T-DNA insertion (one primer internal to the T-DNA and another in the genomic DNA). Surprisingly, both T-DNA insertion sites cosegregated perfectly with the mutant phenotype.. Mutant 005 was designated lateral root development 5 (lrd5-1). Of the two T-DNA insertions identified in lrd5-1, the first was located within an intron in gene At2g35610 and the second within an exon in gene At3g20640. Since the T-DNA insertions were predicted to be on separate chromosomes, the fact that both T-DNA insertions cosegregated perfectly with each other and with the mutant phenotype suggests the possibility of genomic rearrangement in lrd5-1. To determine which mutation was responsible for the mutant phenotype, SALK T-DNA alleles of At2g35610 SALK_066991 (lrd5-2) and SALK_058092 (lrd5-3) were examined (no alleles of At3g20640 were available at the time of this work). These alleles are in the Col background. Both lrd5-2 and lrd5-3 showed increased total lateral root length, like the original mutant lrd5-1, when grown with parafilm blocking contact between the aerial tissues and media (Fig. 3A). Additionally, a cross between the original T-DNA mutant lrd5-1 and lrd5-2 failed to rescue the mutant phenotype (Fig. 3B; since the two alleles are in different backgrounds, crosses are included to eliminate the possibility of interactions between mutant alleles and disparate genetic backgrounds) These results confirm that the T-DNA insertion in At2g35610 is causal for the mutant phenotype in lrd5-1.. . Fig. 3.. . Phenotyping and complementation tests with three alleles of LRD5. (A) Total lateral root length for several alleles of lrd5 grown with parafilm isolating aerial tissue from media: all mutants are significantly different from their respective wild-type backgrounds (P<0.01, Students paired t-test); data are meanstandard error (n=23-63); lrd5-1 is in the Ws background while lrd5-2 and lrd5-3 are in the Col background. (B) Total lateral root length for the wild type, two alleles of lrd5, F1 plants from complementation test crosses, and F1 plants from control crosses; data are meanstandard error (n=17-53). Differences between lrd5-1lrd5-2 and all controls are significant (P<0.01, Students paired t-test).. . . . . . . LRD5 modifies cell wall proteins. . LRD5 encodes a gene with no known domains or motifs. Previous computational studies have grouped LRD5 within the glycosyltransferase family 77 based on homology to other glycosyltransferases (www.cazy.org). This result was confirmed by a BLAST search using the predicted protein sequence of LRD5 against the NCBI sequence database. Six Arabidopsis genes showed significant homology to LRD5 (Fig. 4), all of which belong to the glycosyltransferase family 77 (www.cazy.org). Several of these genes have been previously identified to play a role in cell wall biosynthesis (Egelund et al., 2006, 2007, 2008). The most closely related gene, At1g70630, is predicted to encode a protein with 51% amino acid similarity over a stretch of 155 amino acids located towards the middle of the protein sequence. However, no significant similarity was found along the rest of the protein sequence. This gene was recently named Reduced Arabinose Yariv1 (RAY1) and shown to play a role in arabinosylation of cell wall arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs; Gille et al., 2013).. . Fig. 4.. . Amino acid phylogeny using the neighbour-joining method using select sequences identified from a BLAST search using the protein sequence of LRD5. Several species included several homologous sequences, which are individually numbered. RGXT1, RGXT2, RRA1, and RRA2 have all been shown to be involved in cell wall biosynthesis.. . . . The BLAST search also identified sequences in over 30 plants, the moss Physcomitrella patens, and three algae (O. lucimarinus, Ostreococcus taurii, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) that showed greater homology to LRD5 than the closest homologue in Arabidopsis (selected examples shown in Fig. 4). Given that Arabidopsis diverged from Ostreococcus and Chlamydomonas roughly 1 billion years ago (Yoon et al., 2004), this suggests that LRD5 diverged from its closest Arabidopsis homologue at least that long ago.. Recently, mutants in LRD5 (lrd5-2/xeg113-2 and lrd5-3/xeg113-3) were characterized and shown to have an increase in etiolated hypocotyl length, rosette size, and early inflorescence bolting (Gille et al., 2009) and root hair growth (Velasquez et al., 2011). These mutants contained reduced arabinosylation of cell wall extensins and the authors proposed that LRD5 functions as an extensin arabinosyltransferase. The authors concluded that extensin glycosylation by At2g35610 is an important determinant for proper cell elongation. However, it was not immediately obvious how these results relate to the lateral root phenotype seen in lrd5 mutants.. . . Mutants in LRD5/XEG113 show an increased rate of lateral root development and emergence. The increase in lateral root formation observed in mutants in LRD5/XEG113 may be due to an increase in the number of initiated primordia, the rate at which primordia emerge, or both. This question was addressed by analysing the density of initiations and the frequency of emergence in 14-day-old lrd5-2 and wild-type (Col) seedlings. lrd5-2 seedlings showed no increase in the number of primordia, but a large increase in the frequency with which these primordia emerge (Fig. 5). (A striking increase in emergence was also seen in lrd5-1 in comparison to its wild-type background (Ws) (Supplementary Fig. S3A available at JXB online), although the phenotype was less pronounced due to the higher emergence rate in Ws vs. Col). These results suggest that aberration in some aspect of the emergence process strongly contributes to the lateral root formation phenotype in lrd5 mutants, although the possibility remains that an increase in lateral root growth rate also contributes to the phenotype.. . Fig. 5.. . Number of initiations and emergence rate for lrd5-2 and the wild type (Col). Emergence rate is measured as the number of emerged primordia divided by total number of primordia. A total of 161 primordia were analysed for lrd5-2 and 254 for Col. No difference in initiations per cm was seen in the mutant (Students paired t-test). In contrast, emergence rate was significantly increased (P<0.01, pooled z-statistic). Data are meanstandard error (161 primordia in 10 seedlings lrd5-2 and 254 primordia in 10 seedlings for Col).. . . . Given that primordia emerge more frequently in lrd5, the developmental stages of the primordia were next examined. To more accurately monitor the developmental process of lateral root primordia in wild-type and lrd5 seedlings and to allow a detailed comparative time course of lateral root development, lateral root initiation was synchronized. lrd5-2 was crossed into plants containing the pIAA14::mIAA14-GR, a dexamethasone-inducible dominant allele of IAA14 (Fukaki et al., 2005). IAA14 (SLR1) is a major component of auxin-mediated lateral root initiation, and a dominant mutation of IAA14, mIAA14, completely abolishes lateral root initiation. Grown in the presence of dexamethasone, pIAA14::mIAA14-GR seedlings do not initiate any primordia; upon removal of dexamethasone, pIAA14::mIAA14-GR seedlings initiate primordia in young tissues. This system thus allows for the synchronous initiation of primordia in seedlings old enough to form lateral roots. Wild-type (Col) and lrd5-2 seedlings containing the pIAA14::mIAA14-GR construct were grown on repressive media containing dexamethasone for 9 d and then transferred to media lacking dexamethasone. After 5 d, the seedlings were cleared and primordia were scored based on the staging described by Malamy and Benfey (1997) (Fig. 6). lrd5-2/pIAA14::mIAA14-GR seedlings contained fewer primordia than the wild type at each of the seven pre-emergence stages, but more emerged primordia. Since no differences in initiation rate are predicted in lrd5-2, this result must be explained by an increase in the rate at which primordia progress through the entire developmental process. The reduction even in stage 1 and 2 primordia indicates that the increased rate of development starts around the time that primordia first initiate.. . Fig. 6.. . Proportion of lateral root primordia at each stage 5 d after release of SLR1 inhibition of initiation in lrd5-2 and wild type (Col). All comparisons except stage 6 are statistically significant (P<0.05, pooled z-statistic. Data are meanstandard error (n=16).. . . . . . . LRD5/XEG113 does not directly affect whole-plant growth. The increase in lateral root formation per unit shoot size (Fig. 2) suggests that the effects of the LRD5/XEG113 mutation are root specific. This would further predict that the increase in aerial tissue growth observed here (Fig. 1) and by Gille et al. (2009) in lrd5/xeg113 mutants is a result of the increase in lateral root growth rates. To test this idea, wild-type (Col) and lrd5-2 seedlings containing the pIAA14::mIAA14-GR construct were grown on media with dexamethasone for 14 d. Indeed, when lateral root formation was inhibited in lrd5-2/xeg113, shoot size was indistinguishable from the wild type (Fig. 7). This indicates that changes in shoot growth in lrd5 are secondary, and not causal, to increased lateral root formation.. . Fig. 7.. . Aerial tissue size (A. 430) of the wild type and lrd5-2 with mIAA14 induced by dexamethasone. Differences between the two genotypes are not statistically significant (Students paired t-test). Data are meanstandard error (n=39).. . . . . . . LRD5/XEG113 is expressed in trichoblasts and cells near the root tip. To better understand how XEG113/LRD5 functions in the root to affect lateral root development, a transgenic construct consisting of 2kb promoter sequence driving the wild-type cDNA fused to GFP (pLRD5::LRD5-GFP) was created. This construct was transformed into lrd5-2 and two independent lines were identified that showed strong GFP expression and also rescued the mutant lateral root phenotype by reducing total lateral root length (Fig. 8A) and lateral root emergence rates (Supplementary Fig. S3B available at JXB online).. . Fig. 8.. . Endogenous expression pattern of LRD5. (A) Total lateral root length for lrd5-2 and lrd5-2 with two separate rescue constructs. lrd5-2 is significantly different from all other genotypes (P<0.01, Students paired t-test). Data are meanstandard error (n=47-77). (B) Strong GFP expression is seen in the trichoblast cell file in plants transformed with constructs shown in A.. . . . . LRD5/XEG113 is most strongly expressed in the trichoblast cell file just basal to the primary root tip, with decreasing expression intensity in more mature regions of the root (Fig. 8B). These results are consistent with the publicly available microarray data (www.arexdb.org). The microarray data also suggests that LRD5 is expressed at low levels in most cell layers just behind the primary root tip. This expression is barely visible using fluorescence microscopy (not shown). No expression is predicted or can be seen in lateral root primordia or cells overlying primordia (not shown).. The finding that LRD5/XEG113 is expressed near the root tip and not expressed in or around primordia suggests that this gene either acts non-cell autonomously or plays a role in early wall formation in cells that will later play a role in primordia emergence (i.e. cells that will come to overly a primordium later in development). Since it is difficult to imagine how trichoblast cell wall composition would affect lateral root primordia emergence, it is hypothesized that the second model is correct (see Discussion).. . . Related and unrelated cell wall mutants also show a lateral root phenotype. Mutations in LRD5/XEG113 result in reduced arabinosylation of extensins in the cell wall (Gille et al., 2009) and increased rate of lateral root development and emergence (this study). To test whether other Family 77 glycosyltransferases showed lateral root phenotypes under the screening condition, knockout lines were obtained for At1g70630 (RAY1, the closest homologue to XGE113/LRD5 in Arabidopsis), RRA1 and RRA2. The latter two mutants, although altered in closely related and tandemly duplicated genes, show slight reductions in arabinose content (Egelund et al., 2007). (Mutants in RGXT1, RGXT2, and RGXT3, previously studied Family 77 genes, were not tested as RGXT1 and RGXT2 are tandemly duplicated genes with no detectible phenotypes/defects when mutated and confirmed alleles of RGXT3 are not available). Whereas rra1 and rra2 had no detectible lateral root phenotype, the mutant allele of At1g70630 (Salk_053158, ray1) showed a dramatic increase in lateral root formation compared to the wild type (Col) (Table 1 and Fig. 9). To see if At2g35610 and At1g70630 act in parallel, lrd5-2/xeg113 and ray1 were crossed to form a double mutant. Although the double mutant did not have altered lateral root formation compared to ray1 (the mutant with most lateral root formation) with aerial tissues contacting media, on parafilm the double mutant showed a much stronger phenotype compared to both lrd5-2 and ray1 (Table 1). RAY1 was recently shown to play a role in arabinosylation of AGPs and not extensins (Gille et al., 2013). This suggests that two Family 77 glycosidases with varying functions in cell wall modification affect lateral root formation and that the lrd5/xeg113 phenotype is not specific to extensin modification.. .

Many cell wall mutants show lateral root phenotypes.. . . . To further investigate the relationship between cell wall properties and lateral root formation, a panel of mutants previously characterized to have altered cell wall composition were screened for lateral root phenotypes (Fig. 9). Attention was focused on the murus (mur) series of mutants, as well as prc1 (cesa6), irx1 (cesa8), and xxt1/xxt2 (Reiter et al., 1997; Turner and Somerville, 1997; Fagard et al., 2000; Cavalier et al., 2008). This set includes mutants with altered levels of cellulose, xyloglucan, fucose, arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, and/or mannose in the cell wall (all but one of the mutants altered in arabinose have not been cloned and therefore it is unknown if they are altered in the same pathway as lrd5). Interestingly, nine out of 14 mutants in this set showed an increase in lateral root formation compared to the wild-type background (Col) when grown under repressive conditions (Table 1). Lateral root formation was also analyzed in each of the cell wall mutants grown on parafilm to restrict contact between the leaves and the nutrient media, to reveal whether differences in shoot uptake of media sucrose could account for the root system phenotypes, as has been seen previously for mutants in cuticle formation (Macgregor et al., 2008). While the phenotypes of mur3, mur9, and mur 11 might be attributable to this phenomenon, the remaining mutants tested still showed increased lateral root formation when their shoots were isolated on parafilm, indicating that these mutants form increased numbers of lateral roots independent of nutrient uptake through aerial tissues. Together, these results demonstrate that the phenotype seen in lrd5/xeg113 is not specific to cell wall extensin arabinosylation or to cell wall arabinose levels, but is shared with many mutants that compromise cell wall biosynthesis..
PMC3467300	Results. A total of 130 genes exhibited altered expression (2.0 fold) under Fe deficiency in. Kas-1 rosettes, while Tsu-1 had a much higher number of Fe-regulated genes, 690 in total. (Supplementary Fig. S1 at. JXB online). Most of these genes were differentially expressed. transiently at the 24h time point in Tsu-1. The numbers of up-regulated genes exceeded the. number of down-regulated genes. Comparing the Fe regulon between ecotypes, there were. largely dissimilar sets of genes with altered expression in Fe-deficient rosettes (Fig. 1), as was observed for Fe deficiency-regulated gene. expression in roots (Stein and Waters, 2011). In. addition to Kas-1 and Tsu-1, rosette Fe deficiency-regulated genes from Col-0 (Wintz et al., 2003; Schuler et al., 2011) were included. in this analysis. For up-regulated genes, the majority (599 of 678; 88%) were observed in. only one of the three ecotypes. For down-regulated genes, 98.6% of all differentially. regulated genes were observed in rosettes of only one ecotype. The different Fe-regulated. transcriptomes between ecotypes were associated with differences in over-represented GO-slim. categories (Supplementary Fig. S2).. Over-represented categories for up-regulated genes in Tsu-1 rosettes were found for all. three primary GO categories. Up-regulated genes in Kas-1 fell into only two of the primary. categories. Up-regulated Col-0 genes contained over-represented genes in all three primary. GO categories, but were largely different from those of Tsu-1 or Kas-1. For down-regulated. genes in Tsu-1 rosettes, all three primary categories contained over-represented classes.. This is in contrast to down-regulated genes in Kas-1, where no GO-slim categories were. over-represented. Only one category was over-represented for Col-0 down-regulated genes.. . Fig. 1.. . Three-way Venn diagrams of expression of Fe-regulated genes in rosettes. Numbers. represent counts of up-regulated or down-regulated genes in Col-0, Tsu-1, and Kas-1. ecotypes under control or Fe deficiency conditions.. . . . Genes that were up-regulated in both Kas-1 and Tsu-1 are presented in. Table 1. Seven genes were up-regulated in Kas-1,. Tsu-1, and Col-0 (Table 1), including the. ferric-chelate reductase FRO3, the E3 ligase BTS, and the. oligopeptide transporter OPT3. A larger number of genes were up-regulated. only in two of the three ecotypes, 72 in total (Fig.. 2). Several metal-related genes were found in this data set (Table 1), such as the transcription factors bHLH039,. bHLH101, and PYE, the nicotianamine (NA) transporter. ZIF1, and the nicotianamine synthase gene NAS4. Only two. genes were down-regulated in all three ecotypes (Fig.. 1, Table 2); the FeSOD FSD1,. and the ferritin gene FER4, while two additional genes were down-regulated. in Col-0 and Kas-1; the ferritin gene FER1 and the nicotianamine synthase. gene NAS3.. .

(C) Four-way Venn diagram of genes that were Fe. regulated in any of the Kas-1, Tsu-1, or Col-0 ecotypes.. . . . Within each ecotype, Fe-regulated gene expression in rosettes was. compared with that of roots (from Stein and Waters,. 2011; Table 3). Considering genes that were. up-regulated or down-regulated in both roots and rosettes within a given ecotype, a sum. total of 78 genes were up-regulated in both tissues across the three ecotypes (Fig. 2). However, only two of these (FRO3. and At1g47400) were up-regulated in all three ecotypes, and eight were Fe up-regulated in. two of the three ecotypes (Fig. 2A, Table 3). A total of 28 genes were down-regulated by Fe. deficiency in both roots and rosettes within the specific ecotypes, but only one. (FSD1) was observed in all three ecotypes (Fig. 2B, Table 3). Union sets of all. rosette Fe-regulated genes and all root Fe-regulated genes were also made, regardless of. ecotype source, and these root and shoot sets were then compared. In this comparison, 111. genes were up-regulated in both roots and rosettes, while 41 were down-regulated in both. roots and rosettes (Fig. 2C). There were also 188 genes. (6.4%) that had opposite patterns of Fe regulation in rosettes and roots (up-regulated in. one tissue and down-regulated in the other). Two genes that were up-regulated in roots and. down-regulated in rosettes are IREG3 (roots 2.9-fold, Tsu-1 48h; rosettes. -2.7-fold, Tsu-1 24h) and the copper transporter COPT2 (roots. 2.6-fold, Tsu-1 48h; rosettes -2.4-fold, Kas-1 24h). Another 108 genes (3.7%) had. contradictory expression patterns (e.g. found to be both up-regulated or down-regulated in. different time points or ecotypes). The majority of Fe-regulated genes (2584, 87%) were. expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Many of the genes that were Fe regulated similarly in. both roots and leaves are known metal-related genes (e.g. involved in metal transport or. homeostasis) (Table 3) that were differentially. expressed under Fe deficiency in rosettes in multiple ecotypes (Table 1). Some additional genes that were expressed similarly in both. tissues include the metal transporter NRAMP4, the copper chaperone. CCH, and the metal-NA transporter YSL2.. . Table 3.. .

To validate the microarray results, real-time RT-PCR was performed. for some of the genes regulated by Fe in both roots and rosettes, using RNA from Kas-1 and. Tsu-1 rosettes over a time course. This experiment also served to test whether the. difference in timing of response after Fe withdrawal that was observed in roots (Stein and Waters, 2011) was also present in rosettes.. Expression of OPT3, FRO3, and NRAMP4 was. up-regulated at earlier time points in Kas-1 than in Tsu-1 (Fig. 3). OPT3 was up-regulated on a similar time scale in. rosettes to that in roots, whereas NRAMP4 and FRO3 were. up-regulated earlier in rosettes than in roots; in Kas-1 at 8h in rosettes for both genes,. compared with 16h for NRAMP4 in roots and 48h for FRO3 in. roots. As indicated by the array results, COPT2 expression showed opposite. responses in roots and rosettes. In roots, COPT2 was up-regulated in Kas-1. by 8h and in Tsu-1 by 16h, whereas in rosettes expression of this gene decreased in both. ecotypes from 16h onwards, with a maximum decrease at 24h before recovering to nearly normal. levels by 72h.. .

M Fe; -Fe, no added Fe.. . . . To define further the molecular activity of early responses to Fe. deficiency, miRNA expression differences were profiled in roots and rosettes of the. early-responding Kas-1 ecotype, at 24h after removal of Fe as compared with expression in. Fe-replete plants. These miRNA microarrays indicated that eight miRNAs were significantly. differentially regulated after 24h of Fe deficiency. The abundance of these eight miRNAs was. quantified by real-time RT-PCR in both Kas-1 and Tsu-1 roots and rosettes over a time course. beginning at 2h after Fe removal from the nutrient solution (Fig. 4). Four miRNAs, 172c, 397a, 165a, and 166a, had altered levels in the roots.. miR172c decreased in Kas-1 at 4h and then gradually increased to normal levels, while there. was no change in expression in Tsu-1. miR397a decreased in both ecotypes, but had an earlier. decline then recovery in Kas-1 than in Tsu-1, reaching minimal values in Kas-1 at 8h and in. Tsu-1 at 48h. miR165a and 166a had similar expression patterns, in that they decreased then. recovered in Kas-1 while decreasing more slowly and steadily in Tsu-1.. . Fig. 4.. .

MiR158a had a transient increase at 24h and. 32h in Kas-1, and gradually increased by 26% in Tsu-1. MiR163 increased at later time points. in Kas-1, while this miRNA did not have strong changes in Tsu-1. The miR398s, a and b/c. (which are identical at maturity but are encoded by different genes), decreased beginning at. 16h in both ecotypes, on a similar time frame, ending at ~20% of the starting abundance. The. microarray results were next checked for expression differences for known or predicted. (Bonnet et al., 2010) targets. of the miRNAs. Several of the target genes were Fe regulated either in roots or in rosettes. (Table 4). Some of the most well characterized of. these miRNAs, miR398a and b/c, decreased in abundance in rosettes, and had several targets.

The known targets of miR398 and miR397 include. transcripts for Cu-containing proteins (Sunkar. et al., 2006; Yamasaki. et al., 2007; Beauclair. et al., 2010). Expression of the SOD genes CSD1. and CSD2, and FSD1 and FSD2, were then. measured over a time course in Kas-1 and Tsu-1 rosettes in response to withdrawal of Fe. (Fig. 5). Unlike OPT3,. NRAMP4, and FRO3, the SOD genes responded on similar. time scales in both Kas-1 and Tsu-1. Both CSD1 and CSD2. increased to nearly 2-fold in both ecotypes, while FSD1 and. FSD2 decreased in both ecotypes. FSD1 decreased to very. low levels by 24h, while FSD2 decreased more slowly.. . Table 4.. .

Since CSD1 transcript levels increased and.

Cu, Fe, and Zn were measured over a time course in Kas-1, Tsu-1, and Col-0 rosettes and. roots (Fig. 6). After Fe was withdrawn, there was no. change in bulk rosette or root Fe concentration until 48h. Rosette Fe concentration in Kas-1. and Col-0 decreased rapidly from 48h to 120h, while Tsu-1 concentrations declined more. slowly and were not significantly lower until 120h. Root Fe concentrations declined. similarly in the three ecotypes. However, the Cu concentration rapidly increased in both. roots and rosettes. In Kas-1 and Col-0, the rosette Cu concentration more than doubled. within the first 24h, whereas Cu increased in Tsu-1 later, at 48h. Root Cu concentration. rapidly increased in all three ecotypes until 48h or 72h, then afterwards declined, but. remained elevated compared with +Fe roots.

However, deficiencies of both metals resulted in a >2-fold. increase in formation of TBARS in Col-0 rosettes. The effect of Fe deficiency on reactive. oxygen species scavenging was then tested in the ccs1 mutant, which is. defective in the copper chaperone for SODs that is essential for the insertion of Cu into. the apoproteins to form functional CuSOD proteins (Chu. et al., 2005). Under Fe-replete conditions, this mutant had no. increase in formation of TBARS relative to Col-0, but under Fe deficiency the plants were. less able to scavenge reactive oxygen, as lipid peroxidation was 4-fold greater.. .

PMC113751	Results. Mobilization of storage lipid by germinating seeds of the model oilseed plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. occurs at a greatly reduced rate in the presence of exogenous glucose or mannose, but not in the presence of equi-molar 3-O-methylglucose or sorbitol. The sugar-insensitive5-1/abscisic acid-insensitive4-101 (sis5-1/abi4-101) mutant is resistant to glucose inhibition of seed storage lipid mobilization. Wild-type seedlings become insensitive to glucose inhibition of storage lipid breakdown within 3 days of the start of imbibition..
PMC3713338	Results. . Selection of target genes. Several different forward genetic screens have been used successfully to identify mutants with altered response to the levels of soluble sugars, such as Glc, Suc, and mannose. However, forward genetic screens may not allow identification of all the genes involved in sugar response. In cases where two or more genes carry out redundant functions, mutating just one of those genes may cause only a weak phenotype that is difficult to detect via a forward genetics approach. Use of both reverse and forward genetics approaches may thus allow identification of a greater number of the genes that affect a given process. Toward this end, a reverse genetics approach was used to identify genes involved in sugar response.. The reverse genetics approach used in this study was based on the rationale that some of the genes involved in sugar response might themselves be regulated by sugars at the steady-state mRNA level. It should be noted that the success of this strategy is not dependent on all of the genes involved in sugar response being sugar regulated. In theory, a reverse genetic screen based on this rationale may be successful if even only one gene involved in sugar response is itself sugar regulated. To further narrow the list of candidate genes emphasis was placed on genes predicted to encode proteins with activities commonly associated with response networks. Examples of such activities include transcriptional regulation, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and chromatin modification. Consequently, genes that are sugar regulated at the steady-state mRNA level and that are predicted to encode proteins with activities commonly associated with response networks were considered to be candidates to act in a sugar-response network.. Sugar-regulated genes were identified by incubating Arabidopsis thaliana seeds on minimal media for 20 h, followed by an additional 12-13 h incubation on minimal media supplemented with 0.1 M Glc, Suc, or sorbitol (as an osmotic control). This time course was chosen based on findings that wild-type seedlings are only sensitive to the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of exogenous Glc or Suc on early seedling development during the first 32-48 h after the start of imbibition (Gibson et al., 2001). RNA samples extracted from harvested tissues were analyzed using Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips, which contain primer sets for approximately 24,000 Arabidopsis genes (Redman et al., 2004). Approximately 1100 genes that exhibit significant alterations in expression levels on Glc and/or Suc compared to equi-molar sorbitol were identified (Pattison et al., unpublished results). This list was narrowed down to 189 target genes. In most cases these target genes are predicted to code for proteins commonly found in response networks, such as transcription factors, protein phosphatases, protein kinases, and chromatin modifying proteins.. . . Identification and characterization of lines carrying mutations in target genes. Results indicating that a gene is sugar regulated and is predicted to encode a protein with a function commonly associated with response networks are not sufficient to determine whether that gene actually acts in sugar response. To test whether any of the 189 target genes function in sugar response, T-DNA insertion mutants were identified for as many of the target genes as possible. Putative T-DNA insertion mutants were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center for 170 of the 189 genes. Most of these mutants were generated as part of the SALK collection (Alonso et al., 2003) and the remaining mutants were generated as part of the SAIL collection (Sessions et al., 2002). Multiple independent mutant lines were obtained for some target genes, so that a total of over 200 unique T-DNA lines were obtained. These lines were screened by PCR for the presence of T-DNA inserts in predicted locations, as described (Alonso et al., 2003). Seedlings from lines confirmed to carry the predicted T-DNA inserts were then screened to identify plants that were homozygous for the T-DNA insertions. These efforts resulted in the identification of plants homozygous for mutations in approximately 130 of the 189 target genes.. Seeds from 109 of the homozygous mutant lines were screened for defects in sugar response. High (e.g., 0.3 M) concentrations of exogenous Suc or Glc have been shown to inhibit early seedling development. Seeds sown on media containing high concentrations of Suc or Glc germinate, but the vast majority fail to develop into seedlings with true leaves and expanded cotyledons. Instead, the majority of the seedlings arrest development. These high concentrations of exogenous sugars certainly cause osmotic stress. However, the effects of high concentrations of Glc or Suc on early seedling development cannot be solely explained by osmotic stress as equi-molar concentrations of sorbitol do not exert the same effects (Laby et al., 2000). Mutant lines were tested for a sugar-insensitive phenotype by sowing 50-100 seeds from each line on media containing approximately 0.3 M Glc or Suc. Mutant lines were also tested for a sugar-hypersensitive phenotype by sowing on media supplemented with 0.22-0.23 M Glc or Suc.. . . Identification of sugar-response mutants. The screen for sugar-hypersensitive mutants resulted in the identification of a line carrying a T-DNA insert in AT5G51760. AT5G51760 encodes a protein phosphatase 2 c designated as ABA-HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION1 (AHG1). Mutations in AHG1 have been shown previously to cause abscisic acid, Glc, Suc, and mannitol hypersensitive seed germination phenotypes (Nishimura et al., 2007). The screen for sugar-insensitive mutants resulted in the identification of a line that exhibits resistance to the inhibitory effects of both exogenous Glc and Suc on early seedling development. This line carries a mutation in AT1G79000. AT1G79000 encodes HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE1 (HAC1). Further efforts focused on characterization of HAC1 as mutations in HAC1 had not previously been shown to affect sugar response.. HAC1 is predicted to encode a histone acetyltransferase that is orthologous to the p300/CREB-binding protein gene family in mammalian and yeast systems (Bordoli et al., 2001; Pandey et al., 2002). HAC1 steady-state mRNA levels are significantly lower in wild-type seeds germinating on media supplemented with Suc or Glc than in wild-type seeds germinating on media supplemented with an equi-molar concentration of sorbitol (Figure 1). To test further whether mutations in HAC1 are responsible for the sugar-response phenotype, additional lines predicted to carry T-DNA insertions in HAC1 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Homozygous mutants were identified for a total of three independent lines that carry T-DNA inserts in HAC1. The precise locations of the T-DNA inserts in these lines were determined by PCR amplification of DNA flanking the T-DNA insertion sites, followed by DNA sequencing of the PCR products (Figure 2A). Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the effects of the T-DNA insertions on HAC1 transcript levels (Figure 2B). For each hac1 mutant tested, PCR primers located 5 of the T-DNA insertion site in that hac1 line detected approximately wild-type HAC1 transcript levels. In contrast, PCR primers located 3 of T-DNA insertion sites detected greatly reduced HAC1 transcript levels in hac1 mutants as compared to wild-type plants. These results indicate that all three hac1 mutants produce partial HAC1 transcripts that are similar in abundance to the full-length HAC1 transcripts produced by wild-type plants.. . Figure 1. . HAC1 expression is repressed by sugars. Wild-type Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized and then incubated in the dark at 4C for 3 days prior to being sown on nytex screens on Petri plates containing solid minimal Arabidopsis media. The seeds were incubated under continuous light at room temperature for 20 h, and then the nytex screens and seeds were transferred to Petri plates containing Arabidopsis minimal media supplemented with 0.1 M sorbitol (Sorb), Glc, or Suc. After an additional 12-13 h, seeds were harvested, followed by isolation of RNA. The RNA was then used for qRT-PCR analysis. The transcript levels of ACT7 and UBQ6 were determined and the geometric means of their Ct used to normalize transcript levels. Transcript levels are expressed as deltadeltaCt. deltadeltaCt = deltaCtHAC1 on sorbitol-delta CtHAC1 on indicated media. deltaCt = CtHAC1 on indicated media-CtACT7/UBQ6 on same media. Negative deltadeltaCt values indicate that HAC1 transcript levels are lower in wild-type seeds germinating on the indicated media than in wild-type seeds germinating on sorbitol. Six technical replicates were performed for each biological replicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations. HAC1 expression on sorbitol vs. Glc or Suc differed with: **p < 0.05; or ***p < 0.02, according to a Student's t-test. N = 3.. . . . . Figure 2. . HAC1 T-DNA locations and affects on HAC1 expression.

The positions of the four primer pairs used for the qRT-PCR analyses depicted in panel (B) are indicated by triangles. (B) Mutant and wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized and then incubated in the dark at 4C for 3 days prior to being sown on nytex screens on Petri plates containing solid minimal Arabidopsis media. The seeds were incubated under continuous light at room temperature for 20 h, and then the nytex screens and seeds were transferred to Petri plates containing Arabidopsis minimal media supplemented with 0.1 M sorbitol. After an additional 12-13 h, seeds were harvested, followed by isolation of RNA. Quantitative RT-PCR was then used to measure transcript levels.

Transcript levels are expressed as deltadeltaCt. deltadeltaCt = deltaCtindicated pimer pair in wild-type - deltaCtindicated primer pair in indicated line. deltaCt = Ctindicated primer pair in indicated line - CtACT7/UBQ6 in same line. Positive deltadeltaCt values indicate that HAC1 transcript levels appear higher in the indicated hac1 line than in wild-type when measured using the indicated primer pair. Conversely, negative deltadeltaCt values indicate that ACT7 transcript levels appear lower in the indicated hac1 line than in wild-type when measured using the indicated primer pair. Two technical replicates were performed for each biological replicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations. For each primer pair, the Student's t-test was used to compare HAC1 transcript levels in each hac1 mutant line vs. wild-type. *p < 0.1; or ***p < 0.02, according to a Student's t-test. N = 4.. . . . . . hac1 mutants are resistant to the inhibitory effects of high sugar concentrations. Characterization of the hac1 lines revealed that all three lines tested are resistant to the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of exogenous Glc and Suc on early seedling development (Figure 3). Unlike wild-type seeds, a significant percentage of hac1 seeds sown on media containing 0.3 M Glc or Suc are able to develop into seedlings with true leaves and expanded cotyledons. The sugar-resistant phenotype of the hac1 mutants cannot be explained solely by an osmo-tolerant phenotype. Mutant and wild-type seeds exhibit similar degrees of sensitivity to sorbitol concentrations that are equi-molar, or slightly higher than equi-molar, to those used to examine Glc and Suc sensitivity (Figure 3).. . Figure 3. . The hac1 mutants are resistant to the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of exogenous sugars on early seedling development. Mutant and wild-type Col-0 (WT) seeds were surface sterilized and then incubated in the dark at 4C for 3 days prior to being sown on solid Arabidopsis minimal media supplemented with the indicated additive. After an additional 14 days in the light at room temperature, seeds were scored to determine the percentages of seeds that had germinated, formed expanded cotyledons and developed true leaves. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Mutant and wild-type results differed with: *p < 0.05; or **p < 0.01, according to a Student's t-test. N = 4.. . . . . . hac1 mutants are moderately resistant to paclobutrazol. Mutations that lead to sugar-insensitive or hypersensitive phenotypes often also affect phytohormone response. For example, a number of sugar-insensitive mutants have been found to be resistant to the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid and/or paclobutrazol (an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of gibberellins) on seed germination (Arenas-Huertero et al., 2000; Huijser et al., 2000; Laby et al., 2000; Gibson et al., 2001; Rook et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2008). Therefore, hac1 mutants were tested for altered sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of paclobutrazol on seed germination. All three of the hac1 mutants tested exhibited slightly faster rates of seed germination on media supplemented with 34 muM paclobutrazol than did seeds from wild-type plants (Figure 4). In addition, the percentages of seeds that germinated within 8 days on 34 muM paclobutrazol were significantly higher for each of the three hac1 mutant lines tested than for the wild-type line. Comparison of the percentages of hac1 and wild-type seeds that had germinated within 8 days on 34 muM paclobutrazol showed that these percentages differed with p values of 0.02, 0.0002, and 0.06 for hac1-2, hac1-3, and hac1-6, respectively. However, the germination rates of the hac1 mutants were much lower on 34 muM paclobutrazol than the germination rates of the spy-3 mutant. The spy-3 mutant was previously identified as a paclobutrazol-resistant mutant (Jacobsen and Olszewski, 1993) and was included in these experiments as a positive control. Thus, the results of these experiments indicate that mutations in HAC1 confer a modest degree of resistance to the inhibitory effects of paclobutrazol on seed germination.. . Figure 4. . The hac1 mutants are moderately resistant to the inhibitory effects of paclobutrazol on seed germination. Mutant and wild-type Col-0 (WT) seeds were surface sterilized, imbibed in the dark at 4C for 3 days and then sown on Petri plates with Arabidopsis minimal media and 0 or 34 muM paclobutrazol. The Petri plates were incubated under continuous light at 22C and scored for seed germination at regular intervals. The spy-3 mutant (Jacobsen and Olszewski, 1993) was included as a positive control. Error bars indicate standard deviations. N = 2.. . . . . . hac1 mutants are defective in seed production. Adult hac1 plants were observed to produce many siliques that were extremely stunted and which contained few or no seeds. To characterize this phenotype the numbers of siliques produced per plant, seeds produced per plant, and seeds produced per silique were determined for hac1 and wild-type plants. Although the average number of siliques produced by hac1 plants was greater than the average number produced by wild-type plants, these differences in silique number were not statistically significant between the samples analyzed (Figure 5). However, analysis of the number of seeds produced per plant revealed that hac1 plants produce significantly fewer seeds than do wild-type plants (Figure 5). As the reduced seed production of hac1 plants does not appear to be due to a reduction in the number of siliques per plant, the numbers of seeds per silique were analyzed. Siliques produced by hac1 plants were found to contain significantly fewer seeds on average than siliques produced by wild-type plants (Figure 5). Thus, the reduced seed production of hac1 plants appears to be due to a decrease in the number of seeds per silique, rather than in the number of siliques per plant.. . Figure 5. . Mutations in HAC1 reduce seed production. Mutant and wild-type plants were grown to maturity. The numbers of siliques on each plant were counted. Siliques were then collected from each plant and the total number of seeds produced per silique and per plant determined. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Mutant and wild-type results differed with: *p < 0.1; **p < 0.05; or ***p < 0.01, according to a Student's t-test. N = 2 (hac1-3, wild-type, WT) or 3 (hac1-2, hac1-6).. . . . . . Mutations in hac1 affect the expression of specific genes. Histone acetyltransferases cause increased transcription of specific genes by modifying histones associated with those genes. Mutations in HAC1 were thus anticipated to affect the transcription of specific genes. Preliminary experiments were conducted using Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips to identify genes that might be expressed at altered levels in hac1 compared to wild-type germinating seeds (data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR was then used to analyze the expression of some of the genes that appeared most likely to be expressed at altered levels in hac1 mutants. In addition, five genes that were previously shown to be sugar-regulated (AT2G28900, AT3G08940, AT4G35770, AT5G07990, and AT5G13930) were included in these experiments.. Nine of the genes analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR exhibit consistent alterations in expression in hac1 vs. wild-type germinating seeds (Figure 6). Eight of these genes exhibit significantly lower transcript levels in hac1 than in wild-type germinating seeds. The ninth gene (AT3G08940) is expressed at significantly higher levels in hac1 than in wild-type germinating seeds. The tenth gene analyzed (AT2G28900) does not exhibit consistently different HAC1 transcript levels in hac1 vs. wild-type. AT1G15330 and AT1G80090 encode AtPV42a and AtPV42b, respectively, which belong to the PV42 class of gamma subunits of SnRK1 complexes (Fang et al., 2011). SnRK1 complexes play a central role in regulating metabolic response and sugar signaling (Halford and Hardie, 1998; Halford et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2007; Polge and Thomas, 2007). AT2G28900 encodes OUTER PLASTID ENVELOPE PROTEIN16-1 (AtOEP16-1). AtOEP16-1 plays in important role in photosynthesis by acting in NADPH:protochlorophyllide reductase A import into plastids (Samol et al., 2011). AT3G08940 encodes LIGHT HARVESTING COMPLEX PHOTOSYSTEM II (LHCB4.2). LHCB4.2 is a chlorophyll A/B binding protein that functions in photosynthesis (Boekema et al., 1999). AT4G09610 encodes GAST1 PROTEIN HOMOLOG 2 (GASA2). GASA2 is postulated to act in response to gibberellins (Herzog et al., 1995). AT4G18650 encodes DOG1-LIKE 4 (DOGL4). DOGL4 is a member of a small gene family that includes DOG1, which functions in control of seed dormancy. However, the function of DOGL4 is currently unknown (Bentsink et al., 2006). AT4G35770 encodes ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA SENESCENCE 1/DARK INDUCIBLE 1 (SEN1/DIN1). SEN1/DIN1 is associated with senescence (Oh et al., 1996). AT5G07990 encodes TRANSPARENT TESTA7 (TT7). TT7 is a flavonoid 3 hydroxylase that acts in anthocyanin biosynthesis (Schoenbohm et al., 2000). AT5G10120 encodes ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE 4 PROTEIN (EIL4). Computational analyses predict that EIL4 is a transcription factor (Riechmann et al., 2000) that might function in gibberellic acid signaling and/or in biosynthesis of gibberellins (Heyndrickx and Vandepoele, 2012). AT5G13930 encodes CHALCONE SYNTHASE/TRANSPARENT TESTA4 (CHS/TT4). CHS/TT4 functions in anthocyanin biosynthesis (Feinbaum and Ausubel, 1988).. . Figure 6. . Mutations in HAC1 cause altered expression of specific genes. Mutant and wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized and then incubated in the dark at 4C for 3 days prior to being sown on nytex screens on Petri plates containing solid minimal Arabidopsis media. The seeds were incubated under continuous light at room temperature for 20 h, and then the nytex screens and seeds were transferred to Petri plates containing Arabidopsis minimal media supplemented with 0.1 M sorbitol (Sorb) or Suc. After an additional 12-13 h, seeds were harvested, followed by isolation of RNA. Quantitative RT-PCR was then used to measure transcript levels. The transcript levels of ACT7 and UBQ6 were determined and the geometric means of their Ct used to normalize transcript levels. Transcript levels are expressed as deltadeltaCt. deltadeltaCt = deltaCtindicated gene in wild-type on sorbitol - deltaCtindicated gene in indicated line on indicated media. deltaCt = Ctindicated gene in indicated line on indicated media - CtACT7/UBQ6 in same line on same media. Positive deltadeltaCt values indicate that transcript levels for the indicated gene are higher in the indicated line on the indicated media than in wild-type seeds incubated on sorbitol. Conversely, negative deltadeltaCt values indicate that transcript levels for the indicated gene are lower in the indicated line on the indicated media than in wild-type seeds incubated on sorbitol. Two technical replicates were performed for each biological replicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations. The results of Student's t-tests comparing transcript levels for seeds germinated on 0.1 M sorbitol vs. seeds of the same line germinated on 0.1 M Suc are indicated by asterisks above the columns indicating the average transcript levels for seeds germinated on 0.1 M sorbitol. The results of Student's t-tests comparing transcript levels in hac1 vs. wild-type seeds germinating on the same media are indicated by asterisks below the columns indicating the average transcript levels for each hac1 allele on each media. *p < 0.1; **p < 0.05; or ***p < 0.02, according to a Student's t-test. N = 4.. . . . Gene expression was analyzed in seeds germinating in the presence of both 0.1 M Suc and 0.1 M sorbitol. Transcript levels of several of the genes are significantly induced by Suc in wild-type germinating seeds (Figure 6). None of the 10 genes analyzed was significantly Suc-repressed in wild-type germinating seeds. Exogenous Suc also significantly affected transcript levels for several of the genes in the hac1 mutants..
PMC4759271	Results. . Leaves of Eas1 mutant plants display early-senescence phenotypes. Chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency are well-established senescence parameters and convenient markers, which can be used for assaying leaf senescence (Oh et al., 1997; Woo et al., 2001). To obtain further insights into the role of photosynthesis in leaf senescence, we developed a novel genetic screen for Arabidopsis mutants with altered photochemical efficiency during leaf development. This approach uses the ratio of variable (Fv) to maximal (Fm) fluorescence, which represents the quantum efficiency of PSII reaction centers. Fv/Fm can be measured continuously and nondestructively using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, which provides a convenient indicator of the photosynthesis during leaf development and senescence (Barbagallo et al., 2003; Rolfe and Scholes, 2010; Harbinson et al., 2012). We used chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to screen for Arabidopsis mutants that displayed an increased or reduced Fv to Fm ratio during leaf development, in which photosynthesis efficiency thus appeared to be altered (Harbinson et al., 2012). One group of mutants that exhibited a clear increase in Fv/Fm at day 20 after planting was isolated. Two allelic mutants, designated eas1-1 and eas1-2 (early senescence 1-1 and -2), showing increased photochemical efficiency and early-aging syndrome throughout the whole of their development, were chosen for detailed characterization.. Fv/Fm of eas1-1 plants was significantly higher than that of the wild type before approximately day 30, whilst it declined from day 30 in eas1-1 plants (Figures 1A,B). The dark-green leaf phenotype and high chlorophyll content in eas1-1 mutant plants are also consistent with their high photosynthetic efficiency in the early growth stage (Figures 1C,D). Moreover, the eas1 mutant appears to have smaller or no trichomes (Figure 1C). Twenty-days-old leaf cross-section anatomy showed more chloroplasts in mesophyll cells in eas1-1 mutant plants than in wild-type plants (Figure 1E). The pattern of change of Fv/Fm was consistent with the change of chlorophyll content throughout the whole of leaf development (Figure 1C).. . Figure 1. .

Error bars indicate standard deviations, while asterisks indicate significant differences from wild-type plants under Student's test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).. . . . To determine whether EAS1 is involved in the regulation of senescence, we observed the aging syndrome in eas1 and wild-type plants throughout the whole of leaf development. Wild-type plants exhibited a consistent increase in Fv/Fm before day 45, while eas1 plants displayed enhanced quantum efficiency of PSII at day 30, which rapidly decreased thereafter (Figure 1B). Consistent with this, the aging syndrome of eas1 mutants, including leaf yellowing and rosette bolting, appeared early compared with that of the wild type plants (Figure 1F; Figure S1). Furthermore, under unstressed conditions, the eas1 mutant plants displayed accelerated leaf senescence in soil and Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Figure 1F; Figures S1A-C).. Map-based cloning and sequencing showed that the eas1-1 and eas1-2 missense mutations were generated in the second exon of the At1g52340 gene and the 190 glutamic acid and the 265 glycine were replaced by lysine and arginine in eas1-1 and eas1-2, respectively (Figure S2A). Surprisingly, this gene is allelic to ABA2/GIN1/SRE1, which encodes a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR1) that catalyze the final oxidation steps in the conversion of xanthoxin to ABA aldehyde (ABAld; Cheng et al., 2002; Gonzlez-Guzmn et al., 2002). To further confirm the results of positional cloning, EAS1 complementation was performed by transforming the missense eas1-1 mutant with a 7.7-kb ABA2 genomic clone that includes the 3-kb promoter through Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Cheng et al., 2002). Six independent- homozygous T3 lines with clear complementation were isolated. These complementary transgenic plants were restored to wild-type phenotype, such as the premature leaf, the growth defects in cotyledons, and rosettes, the wilting and lack of seed dormancy phenotypes of eas1. These results are consistent with the previous obervations (Cheng et al., 2002; Gonzlez-Guzmn et al., 2002). Moreover, genetic crosses also showed that eas1 is ABA2 allelic mutants (Table S2).. We have detected ABA content from 20-days-old rosette leaves in eas1-1 and eas1-2 plants under unstressed conditions. Indeed, compared with the wild type, ABA content decreased by about 20.8 and 23.5% in eas1-1 and eas1-2 plants, respectively (Figure S2B). Seed germination of eas1 occurred significantly more rapidly than that of the wild type under stress conditions (e.g., mannitol and NaCl) or unstressed conditions (Figures S2C,D). The detached leaves of the eas1 mutants exhibited excessive transpiration under unstressed conditions (Figures S2E,F).. To further demonstrate whether overexpression of EAS1 may delay leaf senescence or other unexpected phenotypes, EAS1 overexpression transgenic plants were generated. More than 12 independent transgenic lines were isolated and 8 homozygous transgenic lines presents a consistent phenotype during the whole development. One line (OE-EAS1) were chosen for further study. Confusingly, OE1-EAS1 exhibited no apparent phenotypic differences in aerial structures from the wild type in the early stage (Figures 1C,F; Figure S1C). The young leaves of OE-EAS1 have a slightly larger but not significantly differences in chlorophyll content than that of wild type plants. However, OE-EAS1 could delay leaf senescence and plant flowering (Figure S1A). Leave 5 or 6 of wild-type plants show earlier senescent phenotypes (yellow tip and margin) under unstressed conditions in soil than that of OE-EAS1 plants. The average number of OE-EAS1 rosette leaves before flowering is more 2 leaves than that of wild-type plants.. We also examined the senescence syndrome of detached leaves under dark treatment. Upon exposure to dark conditions, the 20-days-old eas1 leaves displayed more dramatic decreases in Fv/Fm than that of the wild type (Figures 1G,H). Because Fv/Fm of eas1 plants was significantly higher than that of the wild type (Figures 1A,B) before dark treatment, day 0 control picture is not be shown in Figure 1G. In order to confirm the leaf senescence phenotypes of eas1 mutant plants, 25-days-old detached leaves were placed under osmotic and oxidative stresses. The results showed that 500 mM mannitol and 10 mM H2O2 could accelerate leaf senescence of eas1-1 mutant and wild-type leaves, but the aging symptoms (yellowing and necrotic spots) of eas1-1 mutant leaves appeared earlier and were more pronounced than those of wild-type leaves (Figure 2A). Relative chlorophyll contents in eas1-1 mutant leaves were significantly decreased under 10 mM H2O2 and 500 mM mannitol treatment from the second day of treatment (Figures 2C,D). By contrast, ion leakage in eas1-1 leaves increased significantly from the third day (Figures 2E,F). The detected level of DNA content was significantly reduced in eas1-1 mutant leaves (Figure 2B).. . Figure 2. . EAS1 mutations accelerate leaf senescence under osmotic and oxidative stresses.

Three experiments were performed with similar results. Error bars indicate standard deviations, while asterisks indicate significant differences from wild-type plants under Student's test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).. . . . . . EAS1/ABA2 is involved in regulation of the expression of senescence- associated genes in the early stage of plant growth. Since the role of ABA in leaf senescence has not been clearly defined, and only circumstantial evidence has been obtained, we further examined the expression of some senescence-associated genes (SAGs) in wild-type and eas1 mutant plants at different developmental stages. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using RNA samples from leave 6 and 7 of wild-type and eas1 mutant plants grown for 25, 35, and 45 days (Figure 3). The eas1 mutation has been shown to have dramatic effects on the expression of SAG12 (Noh and Amasino, 1999), SAG29 (Seo et al., 2011), SAG113 (Zhang and Gan, 2012), and SAG101 (He and Gan, 2002) at young and old developmental stages. Compared with the wild type, the expression levels of SAG12, SAG29, SAG113, and SAG21 in leaves of 25-days-old eas1-1 were increased by 1523-, 59-, 8.5-, and 8-fold, respectively. However, at day 45, the expression of all four genes was significantly inhibited by the mutation (Figure 3). The expression levels of the other SAGs (SAG13, SAG14, SAG18, SAG101) were also up-regulated from 1.5- to 7.8-fold in eas1 mutants at day 25. The age-dependent induction of SAG13, SAG14, SAG18, and SAG101 also substantially increased at days 35 and 45.. . Figure 3. . Expression analysis of SAGs and CRGs in wild-type and eas1-1 mutant leaves for 25, 35, and 45 days under unstressed conditions in soil. SAGs included SAG12, SAG13, SAG14, SAG18, SAG20, SAG21, SAG29, SAG101, and SAG113. CRGs included PSBA, RBCS, CAB3, and PETB. Actin was used as an internal control. Total RNA was isolated from the sixth and seventh true leaves at the indicated time points. Bars indicate standard errors, while asterisks indicate significant differences from wild-type plants under Student's test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01); three experiments were performed with similar results.. . . . We also examined the mRNA levels of chloroplast-related genes (CRGs; CAB3, RBCS, PSBA, PETB) at 25-, 35-, and 45-d-old eas1-1 plants (Figure 3). Compared with eas1-1 mutant plants, the expression levels of almost all CRGs in wild-type plants gradually increased, and RBCS, PSBA, PETB, and CAB3 were significantly up-regulated.. . . Mutation of EAS1 enhances cell apoptosis under leaf senescence. It is known that leaf senescence is a programmed event that can be induced by a variety of endogenous factors and environmental cues (Lim et al., 2003; Guo and Gan, 2005; Zhang and Zhou, 2013; Li et al., 2014). To confirm whether EAS1 mutation could affect the programmed cell death (PCD) in leaf senescence, several fluorescence-based dyes for the measurement of cell death were applied. In the first set of experiments, trypan blue (TB) staining was used for the investigation of cell viability (Lee et al., 2011). When seedlings were stained with TB, a large number of blue patches were observed in leaves of eas1-1, but were rarely present in wild-type plants (Figure 4A), indicating that age-dependent cell death is increased in eas1 mutants during leaf senescence. Consistent with these observations, total protein extracted from eas1-1 was significantly decreased compared with that of wild-type plants (Figure S3C).. . Figure 4. . EAS1 mutation causes earlier apoptosis in leaves of eas1-1 mutant plants than in wild-type plants.

Leaves were stained with trypan blue for the detection of dead cells. (B) Estimation of cell membrane integrity by PI staining using confocal images. The sixth leaves of wild-type and eas1-1 mutant plants at 35 days after sowing were used to isolate mesophyll cells, epidermal cells, and guard cells under unstressed condition in soil. Cells were subjected to 10 muM DAPI and 10 mug/mL PI staining for 0.5 h. (C) Quantification of age-dependent cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. Mesophyll protoplasts of sixth leaves were counted by cytometry in wild-type and eas1-1 mutant plants at 25, 35, and 45 days after sowing under unstressed condition in soil. Cell counts in the four regions D1, D2, D3, and D4 represent the proportions of late-senescent cells, apoptotic cells, normal cells, and early-senescent cells, respectively. (D) Normal and apoptotic cell percentages of wild-type and eas1 mutant protoplasts. The ratio of normal and apoptopic cells were the average of 15 results from three independent experiments. CXP ACQUISITION and CXP ANALYSIS software packages (Beckman-Coulter) were used for data acquisition and analysis, respectively. Bars indicate standard errors, while asterisks indicate significant differences from wild-type plants under Student's test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).. . . . Membrane deterioration is one of the early events during leaf senescence (Leshem et al., 1984). Therefore, we next examined the membrane integrity of protoplasts of leave 6 in wild-type and eas1-1 plants by using propidium iodide (PI) staining under fluorescence microscopy (Rolny et al., 2011). To test the cell membrane integrity in eas1-1 and wild-type plants, PI staining was used to estimate cell death. When 35-days-old detached leaves were incubated for 0.5 h, there was significant staining of mesophyll and epidermal tissues in eas1-1. However, PI staining was hardly observed in the leaves of wild-type plants (Figure 4B). Furthermore, mesophyll protoplast activity was detected by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) staining (Figure S3A).There was a greater proportion of active mesophyll protoplasts in eas1-1 mutant plants than in wild-type plants after 35 days (Figure S3B).. For the assessment of cell apoptosis in eas1 mutant and wild-type plants at different development stages, we stained mesophyll protoplasts with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Annexin V-FITC) and detected apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. After approximately 30 d, the number of normal mesophyll protoplasts in eas1 mutant plants significantly decreased compared with that in the wild type, while the number of apoptotic cells was increased in eas1-1 mutant plants (Figures 4C,D). The rates of apoptotic cells in wild-type and eas1-1 mutant plants were 6.4 and 11.5%, respectively, at day 45, indicating that EAS1 mutation was associated with a lower survival rate. Together, these results suggest that EAS1 partially protects cells against senescence-induced PCD.. . . ABA signaling, not stomatal behavior, is the causal factor of senescence. The previous series of data establish a general parallel between stomatal aperture size and senescence (Thimann and Satler, 1979a,b; Gepstein and Thimann, 1980), with a strong indication that the stomatal apertures are the causal factor and the effects of stomatal apertures on senescence are actually mediated by the internal concentration of ABA.. To assess the relationship between stomatal apertures and age-dependent leaf senescence, we first measured stomata aperture size and density in several stomatal response and development mutants under unstressed conditions. The results showed that constitutive photomorphogenic1 (cop1; Mao et al., 2005), slow anion channel-associated 1 (slac1; Vahisalu et al., 2008), open stomata 1 (ost1; Mustilli et al., 2002), and ABA insensitive 1 (abi1) showed larger stomatal apertures than that of the wild type (Figures 5A,C). Stomatal openings of the double-mutant epidermal patterning factor (epf)1-1epf2-1 (Hunt and Gray, 2009) and too many mouths (tmm; Yang and Sack, 1995) were smaller, but their stomata were present at a higher density than in the wild type (Figures 5A,D). The level of water loss of detached leaves of these mutant plants was higher than that of wild-type plants (Figure 5B). Similar to aba2-1 mutants, ost1-4, and abi1 mutants displayed earlier leaf senescence than wild-type plants. However, leaf senescence phenotypes of cop1, tmm, and epf11-1 epf2-1 mutants did not differ from those of wild-type plants (Figures 6A,B). The changes of Fv/Fm at different developmental stages displayed similar patterns to those in the observations on leaf senescence (Figure 6C).. . Figure 5. .

(D) ABA content of the fifth rosette leaf of wild-type and mutant plants under unstressed conditions in soil at day 25. Bars indicate standard errors, while asterisks indicate significant differences from wild-type plants under Student's test (**p < 0.01); three experiments were performed with similar results.. . . . To confirm that ABA rather than stomatal behavior modulates the onset of leaf senescence, we determined the ABA content of the above-mentioned stomatal mutants. Except for aba2-1, the ABA content of the mutants was similar to that of the wild type (Figure 6D). These results demonstrated that the degree of opening and density of stomata are not necessarily linked to leaf senescence, and ABA signaling is involved in regulation of the onset of leaf senescence.. . . Calcium ions are involved in ABA signaling in the regulation of leaf development and senescence. The transduction of hormonal signals and other environmental stimuli in plant systems is in many instances mediated through the secondary messenger action of Ca2+ (Poovaiah and Reddy, 1987), which is involved in the regulation of leaf senescence (Poovaiah and Leopold, 1973; Ma and Berkowitz, 2011). On the basis of our results, we hypothesized that ABA might activate calcium signaling as a means of affecting cell function via membrane deteriorative processes. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether calcium plays a role in the processes by which ABA inhibits senescence. Five-days-old seedlings grown on MS medium were then moved to MS agar plates containing nifedipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker. Although nifedipine can accelerate leaf senescence, leaves of eas1-1 seedlings showed a stronger, more pronounced, and earlier senescent phenotype than those of the wild type, characterized by yellowish apoptotic leaves (Figure 7A). Further analysis showed that Fv/Fm and chlorophyll content decreased more rapidly in 8-days-old leaves of eas1-1 seedlings than in those of wild-type plants (Figures 7B,C). In contrast, ion leakage was significantly increased and, on the fourth day of treatment, ion leakage of eas1-1 mutant leaves reached 38.3%, while it was only 15.4% in the wild type (Figure 7D).. . Figure 7. . Calcium deficiency accelerates leaf senescence of eas1-1 mutant plants and analysis of kinetic changes in [Ca2+]cyt in response to several stresses in wild-type and eas1-1 mutant seedlings.

Bars indicate standard errors, while asterisks indicate significant differences from wild-type plants under Student's test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01); three experiments were performed with similar results.. . . . It has been reported that the concentration of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) play important roles in ABA signaling in plants (Jammes et al., 2011; Cheval et al., 2013). The changes of [Ca2+]cyt in wild-type and eas1-1 mutant seedlings under cold shock, osmotic, and H2O2 stresses were thus measured using an Aequorea victoria (Aq) bioluminescence-based Ca2+ imaging method (Bai et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 7E, more significant elevation of [Ca2+]cyt was observed in wild-type plants than in eas1-1 mutant plants. The average values of increased [Ca2+]cyt promoted by different stresses in the wild type were 1.25- to 2.63-fold of those in eas1-1 mutant plants (Figure 7F), which suggested that the eas1 mutation decreased [Ca2+]cyt elevation under cold, NaCl, mannitol, and H2O2 treatment.. . . Effects of ABA on the expression of calcium channel genes and disruption of ABA-activated Ca2+ Channel Activity in eas1-1 guard cells. In order to explain why basal [Ca2+]cyt and increased [Ca2+]cyt in response to stresses were lower in eas1-1 mutant plants than in wild-type plants, the expression levels of several calcium channel genes (ACA3, CAX1, TPC1, CNGC1, and CAX2) were determined by qRT-PCR. The expression of CAX1 and CAX2 was down-regulated, and that of ACA3 and TPC1 was slightly up-regulated in eas1 mutant plants compared with that of wild-type plants at day 25. However, no difference in the expression of these genes was observed at day 35. At day 45, the expression of CAX2 was apparently up-regulated (approximately seven-fold) and the expression of TPC1 was down-regulated by ~60% (Figure 8A) in eas1-1 mutant plants compared with wild-type plants.. .

Error bars indicate standard deviations, while asterisks indicate significant differences from wild-type plants under Student's test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01); three experiments were performed with similar results.. . . . To examine whether endogenous ABA was responsible for the activation of Ca2+ influx currents, Ca2+ influx conductance in wild-type and eas1-1 mutant plants was monitored by the patch-clamp technique. In whole-cell patch-clamp recording using conditions described previously (Bai et al., 2009), 50 muM ABA markedly evoked influx currents in guard cells of both wild-type and eas1-1 mutant plants (Figures 8Ba,c). The average values of Ca2+ channel currents also confirmed these results (Figures 8Bb,d). In wild-type plants, treatment with ABA significantly induced Ca2+ channel activity for inward Ca2+currents compared with the control, which rose from <30 pA at time zero to 205 pA (Figure 8C). In contrast, treatment of mutants with ABA had a minimal effect on Ca2+channel activity compared with that in controls, with changes no greater than 50 pA being observed (Figure 8C)..
PMC3859648	Results. . Quantitative and kinetic differences in SA accumulation and PR1 expression during PTI, ETS, and ETI. To systematically examine the differences in defense phenotypes among PTI, ETS, and ETI, we infected Arabidopsis plants with P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326 strains. Strain DG3 is virulent and can induce ETS while strain DG34 expresses the avirulent effector avrRpm1 recognized by the R protein RPM1 and can induce ETI [30,40]. Strain HrcC- is TTSS-defective and does not deliver effectors into host cells [31,41]. HrcC- has been used as a natural pathogen to activate PTI [42-44]. We used two concentrations for each strain to challenge wild type Col-0, OD600 0.01 (107 colony forming unit (CFU)/ml) and 0.001 (106 CFU/ml) for DG3 and DG34 while OD600 0.1 (108 CFU/ml) and 0.01 for HrcC-. We did not use HrcC- at OD600 0.001 because this concentration did not induce detectable defense phenotypes in our preliminary study. The infected leaves were harvested in a 48-hour time course for SA quantification and expression analysis of the defense marker gene PR1 [30]. Since both free and total SA levels are relevant for defense [33], we measured both SA levels with these samples.. We found that there are kinetic changes in SA accumulation and PR1 expression, depending on the strains and doses used (Figure 1). Consistent with robust defense triggered by the recognition of avrRpm1 by RPM1 [40], DG34 (0.01)-infected plants showed earliest induction of both free and total SA, beginning at 6 hr post infection (hpi) and reaching the peak at 12 hpi (Figure 1A). Compared with DG34 (0.01), DG3 (0.01) induced delayed but higher SA accumulation with free SA peak at 24 hpi and total SA peak at 48 hpi (Figure 1A). The pattern of PR1 expression induced by these two strains at OD600 0.01 was consistent with SA accumulation, with an earlier and stronger induction by DG34 (0.01) than by DG3 (0.01) at 6 and 12 hpi but at 48 hpi PR1 level was higher in tissue infected by DG3 (0.01) than by DG34 (0.01) (Figure 1B). . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0083219.g001. Figure 1. . Dynamic changes in SA accumulation and PR1 expression during PTI, ETS, and ETI.. The fourth to sixth leaves of 30-day-old Col-0 plants were infected with Pseudomonas syringae. pv.. maculicola ES4326 strains, DG3 at OD600 0.01 or 0.001, DG34 at OD600 0.01 or 0.001, or HrcC- at OD600 0.1 or 0.01. The infected leaves were collected at the indicated times for SA and RNA analysis. (A) SA quantitation by HPLC analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA Fishers PLSD tests (StatView 5.0.1). Different letters indicate significant difference among the samples at the same time point (P<0.05). (B) Northern blotting for PR1 expression. Image of rRNA was used for a loading control. . . . . Compared with the higher dose of DG34 (0.01), the lower dose of DG34 (0.001) induced lower SA accumulation and PR1 expression with delayed peaks in the infected plants (Figure 1A and 1B). The lower dose of DG3 (0.001) induced similar levels of SA as DG34 (0.001) before 24 hpi. At 48 hpi, plants infected with DG3 (0.001) showed even higher levels of free and total SA and stronger expression of PR1 than those infected with DG34 at both doses (0.01 and 0.001) (Figure 1A and 1B). Therefore these results highlight that the differences between ETS and ETI are kinetic and are also dependent on the doses of strains used. . Compared with DG3 and DG34 strains, HrcC- at both doses induced much weaker defense responses. Only small levels of both free and total SA and PR1 transcripts were induced at 24 and 48 hpi in plants challenged with HrcC- at OD600 0.1, a concentration that is 10-fold more than the higher dose of DG3 and DG34. HrcC- at OD600 0.01, however, only induced weak expression of PR1 at 48 hpi (Figure 1A and 1B). Together, these results support the quantitative differences between PTI, ETS, and ETI with PTI being the weakest defense as previously suggested [10]. However, the differences between ETS and ETI are kinetic and dose-dependent. While the induction of SA and PR1 expression is faster in ETI induced by DG34 (0.01) than in ETS induced by DG3 (0.01), the strength of the induction is actually higher in ETS than ETI at later time points. Such differences between ETS than ETI are largely abolished when the lower dose (0.001) of the strains was used. . . . Dynamic changes in cell death during PTI, ETS, and ETI. Cell death is commonly known to be induced during Arabidopsis-P. syringae interactions. It is generally believed that ETI activates stronger and faster cell death than ETS and PTI is only associated with weak cell death. Our analysis of Arabidopsis infected with a higher dose of DG3 or DG34 strain (OD 0.01) supports this notion. We found that DG34 (0.01) induced minor cell death in the infected leaves as early as 6 hpi, which became massive from 24 to 96 hpi (Figure S1). Compared with DG34 (0.01), DG3 (0.01)-induced cell death was much delayed, appearing around 24 hpi and becoming massive at 96 hpi (Figure S1). However, such a difference in cell death induction by the higher dose of DG3 and DG34 strains was much minimized when a lower dose of the strains was used. Both DG34 (0.001) and DG3 (0.001) induced much weaker but comparable cell death in the infected leaves from 24 to 96 hpi (Figure S1, arrows indicate single or small clusters of dead cells). Thus these results further support that the differences between ETS and ETI are dependent on the doses of the strains used, as shown for SA accumulation and PR1 expression (Figure 1). Since infection with HrcC- at both concentrations (0.1 and 0.01) only induced minor cell death from 24 hpi to 96 hpi (Figure S1), it is possible that effectors are required to activate strong programmed cell death in host cells and the severity of cell death is correlated with the type of effectors (virulence or avirulence) as well as the quantity of the effectors delivered to host cells. . . . Dynamic ROS accumulation and localization during PTI, ETS, and ETI. Oxidative burst is a key signature during host-pathogen interactions [21,22]. However, where and when ROS are produced during PTI, ETS, and ETI have not been well understood. To provide a better understanding of ROS accumulation and localization during PTI, ETS, and ETI, we infected Arabidopsis leaves with the three strains at OD600 0.01 and collected the leaves in a time course (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 hpi) for fixation in the presence of cerium chloride. Cerium ion reacts with H2O2 to produce electron-dense insoluble precipitates of cerium perhydroxides [38,39]. The fixed tissue was further embedded and sectioned for transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis for the presence of electron-dense cerium deposits, an indicative of H2O2 accumulation. . Mock-treated leaves did not show cerium deposits (Figure 2A and S2). With DG34 infection, we observed strong cerium deposits initially on the cell wall at 6 hpi (Figure 2B and S3). As infection progressed, cerium deposits were additionally found on the plasma membrane and the outer membranes of the chloroplast and mitochondrion from 24 to 48 hpi (Figure 2C and S3). Compared to DG34, DG3 did not induce detectable cerium deposits in the host cells until 18 hpi (Figure 2D, 2E, and S4). Besides the cell wall, the initial cerium deposits were also found abundant on the tonoplast membrane and in the cytoplasm with DG3 infection at 18 hpi (Figure 2E). At 48 hpi, we also observed electron dense deposits on the mitochondria membrane (Figure S4F). On the other hand, HrcC- infection only induced weak cerium deposits on the cell wall at 48 hpi (Figure 2G, 2H, and S5). These results indicate that the rate of H2O2 production varies with ETI being the fastest and PTI being the slowest, corroborating previous studies [38,45,46]. While the cell wall is the primary location for initial H2O2 accumulation during PTI, ETS, and ETI, ETS-induced initial H2O2 accumulation was also found in intracellular organelles while ETI-induced H2O2 accumulation was only observed later inside the cell. Therefore, such differential localization and accumulation of H2O2 suggest that there are different mechanisms of generating H2O2 during PTI, ETS, and ETI. It is also possible that H2O2 molecules induced by pathogens are differentially redistributed during PTI, ETS, and ETI, contributing different mechanisms of PTI, ETS, and ETI in the host. . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0083219.g002. Figure 2. . Dynamic ROS accumulation and localization during PTI, ETS, and ETI.. The fourth to sixth leaves of 30-day-old plants were infiltratedwith P. syringaestrains at OD600 0.01, using 10 mM MgSO4treatment as a control. The infiltrated leaves were collected at the indicated times and were further cut into 1x2 mm sections. The sections were incubated with freshly prepared5 mMCeCl3in 50 mMMOPS at pH 7.2 or MOPS without CeCl3 for 1 h. The samples were then fixed and processed for TEM imaging. At least six different leaf samples for each treatment were fixed, and six sections were observed in each sample. (A) Cell morphology at 0 h. (B-C) H2O2 localization at 6 h (B) and 24 h (C) after DG34 inoculation. (D-F) H2O2 localization at 6 h (D), 18 h (E) and 24 h (F) after DG3 inoculation. (G-H) H2O2 localization at 18 h (G) and 48 h (H) after HrcC- inoculation. Arrows indicate electron-dense cerium deposits. Asterisks indicate bacteria. Ch, chloroplast; CW, cell wall; M, mitochondrion; P, peroxisome.. . . . . . Induction of abnormal growths in leaves during late infection. During the course of the experiments, we carefully examined morphology of the infected leaves. We observed some chlorotic protrusions on the leaves, which began to appear at 3-day post infection (3dpi) and became obvious at 4 dpi (Figure S6A and S6B). We fixed the abnormal growth regions with resin and cut the fixed tissue to semi-thin sections for light microscopy analysis. We found that the abnormal growths consist mainly of enlarged mesophyll cells (Figure 3A, arrows indicate enlarged cells). We also quantified abnormal growth regions by counting the transparent protrusions in the infected leaves, using a dissecting microscope. We found that HrcC--infected leaves showed more protrusions than leaves infected with DG34 (Figure 3B). DG3, on the other hand, did not induce significantly more abnormal growths than the mock treatment. We further fixed and embedded abnormal growth regions for a TEM study. Observations of ultra-thin sections of embedded tissue revealed that the enlarge cells have thicker cell wall than the normal mesophyll cells (Figure S6C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0083219.g003. Figure 3. . The abnormal growth is mainly induced during PTI.. The fourth to sixth leaves of 30-day-old Col-0 plants were infected with P. syringae strains and observed for leaf morphology. (A) Pictures of leaf cross sections. Infected leaves were collected at 4 dpi and fixed for embedding with LR White resin. One-micron sections were cut and stained with 1% toluidine blue O for photographing. Leaves infected with DG3 (0.01) were mostly dead at 4 dpi and thus no data is available. Arrows indicate enlarged cells. The size bar represents 200 mum and applies to all images. Each growth (or a protrusion) has multiple enlarged cells. (B) Quantitation of abnormal growths. The number of abnormal growths, appearing to be transparent protrusions on the treated leaves, was counted at 4 dpi with a dissecting microscope. At least 25 leaves from each treatment were used in the counting. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA Fishers PLSD tests (StatView 5.0.1). Different letters indicate significant difference among the samples (P<0.05). . . . . Cell enlargement is often associated with increased nuclear DNA content. To test if this is the case for the enlarged cells, we embedded the tissue showing chlorotic protrusions with paraplast and stained the sections with DAPI to show nuclei [36,47]. Compared with mock-treated leaf cells (Figure 4A), we found that the enlarged cells induced by DG34 (0.01 and 0.001) and HrcC- (0.1 and 0.01) showed much larger nuclei (Figure 4B-4E, arrows indicate large nuclei). Images of typical nuclei from guard cells, mesophyll cells, and large cells were shown side-by-side with a higher magnification to illustrate the size difference (Figure 4F-4H). We further quantified the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) of the stained nuclei with ImageJ (Version 1.45s). Based on the RFU of nuclei and the assumption that the nuclear DNA content of a guard cell is 2C, we derived the relative nuclear DNA content of the enlarged cells. We found that the enlarged cells have an average of 50C nuclear DNA content, much larger than those of the normal mesophyll cells (18C) in mock-treated leaves (Figure 4J). The nuclei contents of guard cells and normal mesophyll cells from infected leaves were comparable to those from the corresponding cells in mock-treated leaves (data not shown). Such an increase in DNA content of the host cells upon infection is possibly due to the activation of endoreplication, a process involving DNA replication without subsequent mitosis [48]. . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0083219.g004. Figure 4. . The enlarged cells have increased nuclear DNA content.. P. syringae- infected leaves were embedded in paraplast and cut into 15 mum sections for DAPI staining. Images of leaf cross-sections stained with DAPI to show nuclei were captured with a constant exposure time, using a Nikon DS cooled camera attached to a compound microscope. The images are from the following treatments: (A) 10 mM MgSO4, (B) DG34 0.01, (C) DG34 0.001, (D) HrcC- 0.1, and (E) HrcC- 0.01. (F) Typical nuclei of guard cells from a mock-treated leaf. Guard cells from leaves infected with DG34 0.01, DG34 0.001, HrcC- 0.1, or HrcC- 0.01 show visually similar nuclei (data not shown). (G) A typical nucleus of a normal mesophyll cell from a mock-treated leaf. Normal sized mesophyll cells from leaves infected with DG34 0.01, DG34 0.001, HrcC- 0.1, or HrcC- 0.01 show visually similar nuclei (data not shown). (H) A typical nucleus of an enlarged mesophyll cell induced by HrcC- 0.01. Enlarged cells from leaves infected with DG34 0.01, DG34 0.001, or HrcC- 0.1 also show large nuclei (data not shown). Arrows indicate the large nuclei in (A) to (E). The size bar in (A) represents 100 mum and applies to panels (A) to (E) while the size bar in (F) represents 5 mum and applies to panels (F) to (H). (J) Relative nuclear DNA content. The average fluorescence of nuclei of guard cells from mock-treated leaves (1) was set as 2C and was used to quantify relative nuclear DNA content of normal mesophyll cells from mock-treated leaves (2) and the enlarged mesophyll cells induced by HrcC- (0.01) (3). At least 60 nuclei were used for each data point. Nuclear DNA contents of guard cells and normal mesophyll cells from HrcC- (0.01)-infected leaves are similar to those of their corresponding cells from mock-treated leaves (data not shown). Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA Fishers PLSD tests (StatView 5.0.1). Different letters indicate significant difference among the samples (P<0.05).. . . . . . Flg22 but not BTH treatment induces abnormal growth in leaves. The fact that the HrcC- strain induces more abnormal growths than both DG3 and DG34 strains suggests that PTI plays a major role in activating cell growth. To further test this, we infiltrated plants with flg22, a 22-aa synthetic peptide derived from the conserved sequence of flagellin proteins of P. syringae that is commonly used to elicit PTI in plants [4]. We found that both doses of flg22 (1 muM and 10 muM) induced significantly more abnormal growths in leaves (Figure 5A and S7A). When disrupting flg22 perception with the fls2-1 mutation [4], the formation of enlarged cells was abolished. However, HrcC- (0.1)-induced abnormal growths were drastically reduced but not abolished in fls2-1 (Figure 5B and S7B). Therefore, we conclude that flg22-FLS2 recognition triggered signaling is one of the ways to activate cell growth. Other PAMPs could also play a role in affecting host cell fate determination. . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0083219.g005. Figure 5. . FLS2-mediated signaling but not SA induces cell enlargement in Arabidopsis leaves.. Leaves infiltrated with HrcC- (OD600 0.1), flg22 (1 muM or 10 muM), or BTH (10 muM or 300 muM) were quantified for the formation of abnormal growths 4 days post treatment, using a dissecting microscope. (A) Flg22-induced cell enlargement is FLS2-dependent. (B) HrcC- partially requires FLS2 to induce large cells. (C) BTH treatment does not induce abnormal growth. (D) HrcC--induced abnormal growth requires SID2 and NPR1. For quantification of abnormal growths, at least 25 leaves from 12 plants were used for each BTH treatment or bacterial infection and 18 leaves from 7 plants were used for each flg22 treatment. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA Fishers PLSD tests (StatView 5.0.1). Asterisks in (A), (B), and (D) indicate significant difference between treatments of the same genotype (P<0.05). . . . . SA is a signaling molecule critical for PTI and ETI [49,50]. We found that infiltration of Col-0 with BTH (an SA agonist) did not induce significantly more abnormal growths in the leaves, compared with mock-treated Col-0 (Figure 5C). However, disrupting SA biosynthesis by sid2-1 or SA signaling by npr1-1 compromised the formation of enlarged cells in the presence of HrcC- (0.1) (Figure 5D). These data suggest that SA and/or SA signal are necessary but not sufficient to induce large cell formation in Arabidopsis..
PMC4711971	Results. . LHP1 co-purified with FIE PRC2 complex. To dissect the composition of PRC2 complex in Arabidopsis, we used the FIE-3XFLAG fusion protein in immunoprecipitation experiments to identify associated proteins from leaf explants cultured in callus-induction medium. Following mass spectrometry analysis (see Methods), we identified the well-documented PRC2 components, including SWN, CLF, EMF2 and VRN2, as well as the previously considered PRC1 component LHP1 (S1 Table), consistent with recent report in inflorescence [17], indicating that the interaction between LHP1 and PRC2 complex is relatively stable across different tissues. It is worth noting that although LHP1 has the ability to bind the core catalytic subunits of PRC1 including AtBMI1 and AtRING1 in vitro[12,13,16], neither component was identified here, suggesting a special role for LHP1 in association with PRC2 complex.. . . Different PcG subunits have non-redundant roles in repressing particular gene sets via H3K27me3. To compare roles of different PcGs, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to characterize the genome-wide profiles of H3K27me3 in Col-0, clf-29, tfl2-2, atbmi1a,b, and atring1a,b (S2A Table). In Col-0, 5,055 read enriched H3K27me3 regions (peaks) were identified (S2B Table), 84% of which localized in promoter and genic regions (S1 Fig). The top enriched functions for those peak targets include transcription regulation, carpel and petal development (S2C Table). Notably, almost half of the annotated MADS box proteins are marked by H3K27me3 in seedlings (S2C Table). To compare H3K27me3 marks across samples, we first ranked the read intensities of Col-0 H3K27me3 peaks from high to low (Fig 1A panel I), which is positively correlated with the binding of PcG components including FIE, EMF1 and LHP1 (Fig 1A panel VII), and is inversely associated with the expression level of surrounding genes (Fig 1B). Next, the level of H3K27me3 mark in the corresponding regions in mutants were plotted side-by-side with that of Col-0 (Fig 1A panel III-VI), which showed highly similar patterns, with the global level slightly lower in some mutants as compared to Col-0. Similarly, slight reduction of H3K27me3 has also been reported in Arabidopsis mutant lacking EMBRYONIC FLOWER1 (EMF1)[32], a plant specific PcG member [37]. These results indicate that lack of any of these PcGs does not lead to complete loss of H3K27me3.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005771.g001. Fig 1. . Local difference of H3K27me3 marks in mutants of PcG components.. (A) ChIP-seq density heatmaps in Col-0 and PcG mutants, ranked by H3K27me3 read intensity within 500 bp of peak summits in Col-0. The Pearson correlation coefficient between H3K27me3 intensity in Col-0 and FIE binding within 50 bp of peak summits is 0.52. ChIP-seq data of H3K27me3 in panel II and FIE binding in panel VII were published previously [40,41]. To compare H3K27me3 level with the bindings of LHP1 and EMF1 based on published ChIP-chip data [15,32], the fraction of EMF1 peaks (blue) or LHP1 peaks (red) Col-0 overlapped with Col-0 H3K27me3 peaks were plotted. (B) RNA-seq intensity heatmap for the targets of H3K27me3 peaks in Col-0 with the same order as in (A). The expression intensity is measured by Reads Per Kilobase per Million of mapped reads (RPKM). (C) (C) IGV screen shots showing the distribution of H3K27me3 mark intensity in Col-0 and different mutants of PcG components. Negative control is Col-0 sample immunoprecipitated with beads but without antibody. Regions showing quantitative reduction of H3K27me3 marks are highlighted by blue box.. . . . However, we observed different sets of loci showing apparent reduction of H3K27me3 in Arabidopsis deprived of different PcG members, suggesting PcG subunits have non-redundant roles in H3K27me3 deposition in local regions (Fig 1C). Traditional peak overlap method showed poor performance in characterizing H3K27me3 changes in PcG mutants (S2 Fig). Thus, we used the pipeline of MAnorm, a software package specifically designed for quantitative comparison of ChIP-seq datasets [33]. MAnorm derives its power from definition of M value, a statistic characterizing the strength of differential binding, the higher the absolute M value, the larger the difference, with the sign (+/-) representing higher intensity in PcG mutants or Col-0. In clf-29, we identified substantially more regions with reduced H3K27me3 modification than with increased H3K27me3 marks (Fig 2A), consistent with a major role for CLF in catalyzing H3K27me3. Intriguingly, similar pattern was also observed in tfl2-2 and atbmi1a,b (S3 Fig), thus, PRC1 factors possibly contribute to H3K27me3 establishment. We also found hundreds of regions with increased H3K27me3 in clf-29, majority (68%) of which overlapped with H3K27me3 peaks in Col-0, while those non-overlapping regions also tend to be marked by H3K27me3 in Col-0, which are below peak detection cutoff, as shown by the read intensity distribution plot (S4 Fig). This increase of H3K27me3 in clf-29 could be possibly due to the effect of other PcGs. Previous studies in both human and Drosophila also observed hyper-methylation of H3K27 in Ezh2 mutants [38,39], but no consensus has been made about the underlying mechanism.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005771.g002. Fig 2. . Quantitative difference of H3K27me3 marks are inversely correlated with the change of target gene expression in PcG mutants.. (A) MA plot of all peaks from comparison of clf-29 and Col-0 after normalization by MAnorm. Each dot represents a peak. X-axis is the A value, which represents the average intensity. Y-axis is the M value, which represents the difference of the intensity. Here, positive M value indicates higher H3K27me3 level in clf-29 as compared to that in Col-0, and negative M value represents lower H3K27me3 level in clf-29. The color range represents -log10 P value associated with normalized peaks. (B) Enrichment of H3K27me3 peak targets with different M values in gene sets whose expression are regulated by different PcGs. The target genes were grouped by the M values of nearby peaks. For each group, the overlap with differentially expressed genes in a given PcG mutant was compared to the expected overlap at random; x-axis represents enrichment score. Fishers exact test was used to test the significance of overlap. *, P value <5e-2; **, P value <1e-2; ***, P value <1e-3. (C) Bar plot showing the percentage of H3K27me3 peaks with different M values in tlf2-2 overlapped with LHP1 binding sites.. . . . To test if the quantitative difference of H3K27me3 has an effect on differential expression of target genes, H3K27me3 regions were partitioned to consecutive groups ranked by M value, and the gene targets for each group were identified (see Methods). The percentage of genes showing differential expression, up or down regulation separately, are depicted for each group (Fig 2B). In general, target genes associated with negative M value-that is, peaks with reduced H3K27me3 in mutants-were enriched in genes more highly expressed in mutants, and vice versa, which is consistent with the repressive role of H3K27me3. This indicates that the M value determined by MAnorm reflects authentic H3K27me3 changes.. Since loss of LHP1 affects the H3K27me3 level for thousands of genes, we wondered whether the effect of LHP1 on H3K27me3 is direct or indirect. Previous evidence suggested that LHP1 co-localizes with H3K27me3 [14,15]. We compared the overlap between LHP1 binding peaks and genomic regions with change of H3K27me3 in tfl2-2 characterized by M value (Fig 2C). Notably, nearly 1/4 regions with reduced H3K27me3 level (M<0) overlap with LHP1 binding sites as determined by previous ChIP-chip study [15]. The overlap is significantly higher (P value < 1e-3) than expected by chance based on permutation test (see Methods). In addition, we observed that the higher the effect of LHP1 on deposition of H3K27me3-as indicated by low M values-the higher the percentage of corresponding H3K27me3 regions overlapping with LHP1 binding, indicating a direct relationship between LHP1 binding and H3K27me3 change.. . . Different sets of H3K27me3 loci are preferentially regulated by distinct combinations of PcGs. To dissect the cooperation of these PcGs on H3K27me3 modification, we collected 3,289 H3K27me3 regions regulated by at least one PcG component, and clustered the M values of H3K27me3 change in these regions to 3 clusters (Fig 3A and S3A Table). Although LHP1 physically interacts with AtRING1 and AtBMI1 in vitro[12,13,16], the H3K27me3 change profile in tfl2-2 is closely correlated with that of clf-29, with 1,982 regions (peak set I) showing concerted reduction of H3K27me3 in both mutants. On the other hand, loss of AtBMI1A and AtBMI1B or AtRING1A and AtRING1B specifically reduced H3K27me3 level in 566 regions (peak set II), which represents PRC2 target sites affected by AtBMI1 and AtRING1 directly or indirectly, but is independent of LHP1. Thus, the dependence of H3K27me3 on LHP1 seems tightly correlated with the specific effect of CLF. In addition, 741 regions belonging to class III show increased H3K27me3 levels.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005771.g003. Fig 3. . clf-29 and tfl2-2 show coordinated H3K27me3 change profiles distinct from those in atring1a,b and atbmi1a,b.. K-means clustering of M values characterizing the quantitative change of H3K27me3 in PcG mutants. Definition of H3K27me3 quantitative change regions were based on combined criteria |M|>1 and P value <1e-3. Green and red colors represent lower and higher H3K27me3 levels in PcG mutants compared to that in Col-0. IGV screenshots support CLF and LHP1 participate in H3K27me3 elongation. Grey areas represent regions where significant H3K27me3 reductions happen mainly in surrounding regions but not in summit regions in tfl2-2 and clf-29 compared to Col-0. Its worth noting that no smooth should be applied while preparing data for IGV screenshots, or else the difference between Col and clf-29 or tfl-2 would not be as obvious as the raw data. (C) Visualization of the profile of average read intensity around peak summits. All regions from peak set I were aligned such that peak summit is in the center of each region. Next, average read intensities were calculated and plotted for each consecutive 50 bp. (D) The diagram illustrates the finding based on H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data comparisons that LHP1 and CLF participate in elongation of H3K27me3 mark.. . . . It is remarkable to find that CLF and LHP1 have a coordinated effect on H3K27me3 modifications at many genome regions. We wondered how these two factors control H3K27me3 around similar loci. A closer look at regions in peak set I indicates that loss of CLF or LHP1 lead to apparent reduction of H3K27me3 in surrounding regions, but for most cases the signal at the summit is only slightly reduced (Fig 3B). A similar finding was reported supporting CLF-dependent disperse of H3K27me3 around transgenes carrying AG regulatory sequences [42]. Heatmap in Fig 3C showed the average read intensity around summits of peak set I (Fig 3D). Statistical analysis detected this phenomenon for 51% and 53% H3K27me3 reduction regions in clf-29 and tfl2-2, respectively (S3B and S3C Table), indicating that CLF and LHP1 participate in H3K27me3 spreading.. . . The expression of genes involved in different developmental processes are regulated by distinct combinations of PcGs. To investigate the functional consequence of the distinct H3K27me3 profile controlled by different combinations of PcGs, we first characterized the transcriptome change in each PcG mutant, including atring1a,b, atbmi1a,b, clf-29, lhp1-6,and tfl2-2. Next, 2,438 genes with differential expression in at least one of the five mutants were collected, and partitioned to 3 groups according to the expression change pattern across the 5 samples via k-means clustering (Fig 4A and S4A Table). Genes in group I are specifically up-regulated in lhp1-6, tfl2-2 and clf-29, some of which are also induced in atring1a,b to some extent, but have no obvious change in atbmi1a,b. Comparison with expression change in clf-29 and swn-21 indicated that genes specifically increased in clf-29 as compared to swn-21 showing significant enrichment in group I (S5 Fig). Group II represents genes specifically higher expressed in atring1a,b and atbmi1a,b. Group III are genes repressed in all samples, which is perhaps not a direct effect of PcG components. It is interesting that genes from both group I and group II are upregulated in clf-29swn-21 double mutants, whose transcriptome change is closely correlated with that in atring1a,b (Fig 4B), indicating RING1 and BMI1 regulated genes tend to be concertedly controlled by PRC2.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005771.g004. Fig 4. . The profile of transcriptome change reveals two distinct combinations of PcGs with different functions.. Three groups of genes showing distinct expression change profiles across mutants of PcG components. Green and red colors represent lower and higher expression in PcG mutants. Heatmap including another 1,290 genes whose expression affected only in clf-29swn-21 is shown in S5A Fig. RNA-seq data sets were clustered via unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on Pearson correlation coefficients of log2 expression fold-change across samples. (C-D) Functional terms enriched in genes from group 1 (C) and group 2 (D) as shown in (A).. . . . Next, we wondered whether genes from different groups participate in distinct functions or pathways. GO enrichment analysis showed that gene set of group I is closely related with flowering, floral development and transcription (Fig 4C), whereas genes in group II are involved in nutrient reservoir, seed storage, and lipid localization (Fig 4D). Enriched terms and genes are listed in S4B and S4C Table. These functional transcriptome analyses could serve to explain the specific phenotypic defects observed in corresponding PcG mutants.. . . Different combinations of PcGs repress specific developmental programs via H3K27me3 remodeling of tissue-biased genes. To dissect the relationship between genes with distinct change profiles of H3K27me3 and differential expression, the targets for both peak set I and peak set II shown in Fig 3A were identified followed by statistical testing of their enrichment in each of the three expression groups identified in Fig 4A. As expected, genes in expression group I are significantly over-represented in targets of peak set I, representing genes showing decreased H3K27me3 marks and increased expression level in mutants of CLF and LHP1, and thus most likely to be the direct targets of CLF and LHP1 (Fig 5A). Similarly, genes in expression group II are preferentially enriched in targets of peak set II, representing genes affected by AtBMI1 and AtRING1 via H3K27me3 (Fig 5B).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005771.g005.

(C-D) Box plot showing the distribution of expression changes and H3K27me3 changes for 108 genes (C) and 164 genes (D) in PcG mutants. (E-F) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showing a significant normalized enrichment score (NES) for flower biased expression of 108 genes (E) and embryo biased expression of 164 genes (F). The x axis represents all expressed genes ranked by tissue specificity as determined by expression profile, y axis presents the running enrichment score. (G) Heatmap showing NES calculated by GSEA for 108 genes and 164 genes in different gene sets with distinct tissue biased expressions.. . . . To dissect the repressive function of PcGs via H3K27me3, 108 genes with increased expression and reduced H3K27me3 marks in mutants of CLF and LHP1 are extracted (S5A Table). 164 targets regulated by AtBMI1 and AtRING1 were identified in the same way (S5B Table). The distribution of both expression and H3K27me3 change in different PcG mutants were plotted for the 108 and 164 genes, respectively (Fig 5C and 5D). The induced expression of 164 genes in clf-29swn-21 double mutant but in neither clf-29 nor swn-7 confirms that CLF and SWN could complement each others function for these genes. Its also worth noting that mutation of CLF but not SWN is responsible for the induction of 108 genes.. To investigate the function of the 108 and 164 genes during development, we first classified all tissues with gene expression information into 8 groups based on their gene expression profiles (S6 Fig). Next, we calculated the enrichment of the 108 and 164 genes in the different tissue-biased genes using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)[43]. The 108 genes are significantly more highly expressed in flowers, while the 164 genes are preferentially expressed in embryo (S7 Fig). GSEA using RNA-seq data showed consistent profiles with much lower P values (Fig 5E and 5F and S6 Table). Notably, neither gene sets was significantly enriched in other tissues (Fig 5G and S4 Fig), indicating a prominent relationship between PcGs and specific regulation of reproductive and embryo development.. . . Context-dependent regulation of H3K27me3 by different PcG combinations is closely associated with binding motifs of specific TFs. We asked whether this different combination of PcGs is associated with different TFs. We started by searching for the enriched motifs surrounding all Col-0 H3K27me3 peak summits. The top enriched motifs include the binding motifs of ABI3 type transcription factor B3 (ABI3/FUS3/LEC1), ABI4, ABF1, SPL and MYB (S8 Fig). The first three are binding motifs of ABA related TFs, which mainly participate in embryo development [44-47], and is consistent with the well-documented function of PcGs in regulation of embryo development [12,16,31]. Despite the fact that some MADS-box TFs are reported to modulate specific H3K27me3 deposition for regulation of meristem identity, flowering and floral development in individual loci [20,22,23], CArG box, the binding motifs of MADS box transcription factors [48,49], show no enrichment when all H3K27me3 regions are considered (S2D Table).. Next, we identified motifs over-represented in peak sets I and II (Fig 6A and 6B). Of note, binding motifs for MADS box and Homeobox were specifically enriched in peak set I, indicating a close relationship between transcription factors from these families and H3K27me3 levels synergically regulated by CLF and LHP1. On the other hand, motifs enriched in peak set II were similar to the result from all H3K27me3 peaks in Col-0, including ABI4 and ABF1 binding sites. The binding motif for B3 domain TFs are enriched in all H3K27me3 regions, to a higher extent in peak set II, consistent with the major role of their targets in embryogenesis, seed maturation and dormancy [50].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005771.g006. Fig 6. . TF binding motifs and TFs whose bindings enriched in peak set I and peak set II.. (A) Heatmap showing enriched motifs (P value < 0.01) in either peak set I or peak set II.

(D) IGV screen shots showing examples of co-occupancy between H3K27me3 in seedlings and the bindings of MADS-box TFs in inflorescence. The motif sites of MADS box TFs are indicated by pink and blue bars at bottom of the screen shots, and are highlighted by grey area. (E) GSEA showing the common target genes of peak set I and AP1 binding peaks are preferentially expressed in inflorescence.. . . . Since multiple TFs could bind to the same cis-regulatory sites, to identify TFs closely associated with different sets of peaks, we first collected and processed published ChIP-seq data characterizing TF binding profiles from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). By querying against these processed binding sites, we found that the binding regions of some MADS box TFs are significantly enriched in peak set I but not in other H3K27me3 regions (Fig 6C and S7 Table). The top enriched TFs are floral organ identity genes, including AP1 [51], AG [52], AP3 [53] and SEP3 [51]. IGV screenshots in Fig 6D and S9A Fig illustrate some examples of co-occupancy between H3K27me3 in seedlings and these MADS-box TFs. The source of the TF ChIP-seq data, the enrichment statistics and co-occupied regions are listed in S7 Table. It should be noted that these TFs mainly expressed in inflorescence where these ChIP-seq data were generated from, while our ChIP-seq data were generated in seedlings. Thus, it is likely that specific binding of these TFs in some H3K27me3 regions from peak set I is responsible for selective de-repression of common target genes. In support of this, target genes of peak set I co-occupied by these TFs in inflorescence show apparent flower biased expression, while the other target genes of peak set I have no such expression bias (Fig 6E and S9B Fig), indicating the displacement of H3K27me3 by these TFs participating in activation of their common target genes. Consistently, it has been reported that some floral organ identity genes could interact with REF6 [54], the H3K27me3 demethylase in Arabidopsis [41], which possibly work together with MADS-box TFs to remove H3K27me3 marks. Taken together, our genome-wide analyses based on both motif and ChIP-seq data revealed that the bindings of MADS box TFs are closely associated with H3K27me3 peak set I regulated by CLF and LHP1, suggesting that it might be a widespread mechanism by which the specific activities of PcG family proteins is modulated by tissue specific TFs, resulting in distinct transcriptional outputs in different tissues..
PMC4140553	Results. . Docking of acetylated xylan onto cellulose fibrils. To investigate in silico how acetyl esters could affect xylan-cellulose interactions, we docked models of acetylated xylan oligosaccharides, either with an even- or odd-spaced substitution pattern, to cellulose microfibrils. We found that acetyl esters on both sides of the ribbon (odd pattern) would hinder xylan-cellulose interactions on the hydrophilic (010) and (020) surfaces. Steric hindrance could be avoided if these decorations are spaced on alternate xylosyl residues to align on one side of the xylan ribbon, as shown in the model in Figure 1(a). If the xylan is layered on the hydrophobic (100) or (200) faces, then the xylan decorations can be accommodated on either side of a ribbon (Figure 1b). The model was built using the proposed rectangular 24-chain fibril structure preferred by Fernandes et al. (2011) and Thomas et al. (2013). Nevertheless, the steric considerations preventing interactions between acetylated xylan and the hydrophilic cellulose faces hold whether the cellulose microfibrils have hexagonal or square cross sections, and therefore are also true on the (110) and () cellulose faces (Figure S1).. . Figure 1. . Model of acetylxylan interactions with a 24-chain cellulose microfibril. The end view and side view are shown. DP10 xylan chains with evenly spaced 2-O-Ac decorations at every two xylosyl residues were modelled as a twofold helical screw (21). (a) Xylan chains placed on hydrophilic (010) and (020) faces. (b) Xylan chains placed on hydrophobic (100) and (200) faces.. . . . . . Cleavage of acetylated xylan by xylanases. We investigated whether acetylation of xylan is non-randomly arranged along the xylan backbone. Interpretation of any patterning in acetylation of the xylan backbone is complicated by the presence of GlcA decorations on the xylan. Therefore, we also studied acetylated xylan from the gux1 gux2 mutant of Arabidopsis stems, which lacks the GlcA decorations (Mortimer et al., 2010; Bromley et al., 2013). The acetylated xylan from the wild type (WT) and gux1 gux2 mutants was DMSO-extracted from delignified stem cell walls, and acetylation was then studied by NMR. A gradient-selective 13C heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) experiment incorporating a long recovery period was recorded for the purpose of quantifying the degree of the different acetylations (Figure S2; Table 1). The percentage of acetylated residues is approximately 50%, similar to that previously reported for glucuronoxylan from WT Arabidopsis (Xiong et al., 2013).. . Table 1. . Acetylation of gux1 gux2 and wild-type (WT) xylan, determined by the integration of H3/C3 peaks in a 13C HSQC experiment. . . . . . gux1 gux2 (%). WT (%). . . . . Non-acetylated X. 55.6. 46.8. . .

The percentages of xylosyl (X), 2-O-acetyl-xylosyl (X2), 3-O-acetyl-xylosyl (X3) and 2-O-acetyl-3-O-acetylxylosyl (X23) residues are shown.. . . . The extracted acetylated gux1 gux2 xylan was partially digested with xylanase 10B from Cellvibrio mixtus (CmXyn10B). Xylanases are impeded by acetylation of the xylan (Biely et al., 1986). Family-10 glycoside hydrolases bind decorated substrates and therefore cleave the acetylated xylan non-randomly at specific acetylation arrangements in the backbone. CmXyn10B cannot accommodate decorations at the -1 subsite, as both the 2- and 3-OH of the xylose face into the protein, but can tolerate decorations at the xylose at the +1 subsite, as both carbon 2- and 3-OH of this sugar face outwards into the solvent (Pell et al., 2004). With incomplete digestion of the acetylated xylan, Polysaccharide Analysis by Carbohydrate gel Electrophoresis (PACE) showed that a ladder of oligosaccharides of varying length was released by the CmXyn10B enzyme (Figure 2). The size of these oligosaccharides could be reduced by more extensive digestion of the acetylated xylan, confirming that the longer products were the result of incomplete digestion. The main products migrate close to non-acetylated, even-DP (degree of polymerization) xylan oligosaccharides (Xyl2, Xyl4 and Xyl6), and after deacetylation with NaOH they co-migrated with the ladder. Less abundant odd-DP oligosaccharides were also present.. . Figure 2. . Digestion of gux1 gux2 mutant Arabidopsis acetylated xylan with CmXyn10B and EcXyn30 analysed by PACE. Major oligosaccharides have degrees of polymerization (DPs) of multiples of two xylosyl residues. Digestion was carried out with low (L) or high (H) enzyme loads. After deacetylation with NaOH, the predominantly even DP of products is apparent by comparison with xylo-oligosaccharide markers DP1-DP6 (M). No E, no enzyme digestion acetylxylan control.. . . . EcXyn30 xylanase, previously thought to be specific for glucuronoxylan (Urbanikova et al., 2011), was surprisingly also able to cut gux1 gux2 acetylated xylan lacking GlcA (Figure 2). Again, this enzyme released a ladder of acetylated xylan oligosaccharides, dominated by oligosaccharides differing in length by two sugars. After NaOH deacetylation of the more complete digestion, the main products were clearly DP2, DP4 and DP6. Together, these data suggest the CmXyn10B and EcXyn30 xylanases digest non-random sites in the acetylated xylan backbone, and they prefer to cut at sites spaced at an even number of xylosyl residues. This suggests the acetylation is spaced non-randomly, with a pattern associated with an even number xylosyl residues.. . . Alternate xylosyl residues are substituted with acetate. To determine the mass and the degree of acetylation of the CmXyn10B-released oligosaccharides from gux1 gux2-acetylated xylan, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS). The ladder of products revealed higher abundances of xylan DP4, DP6 and DP8 than DP5 and DP7 (Figure 3a), consistent with the PACE results of non-random cleavage of acetylated xylan. The DP4 oligosaccharide most frequently carried two acetyl groups, the DP6 most frequently carried three acetyl groups and the DP8 most frequently carried four acetyl groups. Some oligosaccharides carried additional acetyl groups. The number of acetyl groups is consistent with approximately 50% of residues carrying acetylation (Table 1). To investigate whether this pattern of xylanase-released oligosaccharides was a consequence of delignification and extraction of a fraction of xylan from the wall, xylan was digested directly in alcohol-insoluble cell wall residues. Again, a similar pattern of oligosaccharides was seen (Figure 3b).. . Figure 3. . MALDI-ToF-MS of xylanase-digested gux1 gux2 acetylated xylan. (a) CmXyn10B digestion of acetylated xylan extracted from delignified gux1 gux2 stem cell walls. (b) CmXyn10B digestion of gux1 gux2 stem cell wall alcohol-insoluble residue. (c) 2-Aminobenzoic acid (2-AA)-labelled EcXyn30 digestion of acetylated xylan extracted from delignified gux1 gux2 stem cell walls. (d) CmXyn10B digestion of acetylated xylan in Golgi membrane vesicles prepared from gux1 gux2 stems.. . . . To determine the position of the acetyl groups on the acetylated oligosaccharides released by CmXyn10B, oligosaccharides were labelled with 2-aminobenzoic acid (2-AA), separated by hydrophobic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and analysed by MALDI collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS. Figure 4 shows MALDI-CID MS/MS of Xyl4Ac2 (m/z 774). Interestingly, the acetyl groups were at the -2 and -4 xylose from the reducing end (AcXyl-Xyl-AcXyl-Xyl). Acetate can be accommodated on the 2- or 3-OH of xylose by CmXyn10B at the +1 site (the non-reducing end of the released oligosaccharide, position -4 of this oligosaccharide), but at the -2 subsite only decoration of 3-OH can be tolerated, as a side chain at 2-OH would clash with the protein (Pell et al., 2004; see above). The MS/MS fragmentation indicated some of the acetate groups could be found on the 2-OH and some on the 3-OH of each xylose. This is consistent with the reports that acetyl groups on xylose can migrate between the 2-OH and the 3-OH (Mastihubova and Biely, 2004; Biely et al., 2013); therefore, their native position cannot be determined.. . Figure 4. . High-energy MALDI-CID MS/MS of the Xyl4Ac2 oligosaccharide released by CmXyn10B from gux1 gux2 acetylated xylan, labelled with 2-AA and separated by HILIC.. . . . High-energy MALDI-CID of oligosaccharide Xyl4Ac3. m/z 816 showed the presence of xylose di-substituted at O2 and O3 with acetate (Figure S3). Interestingly, these were either at position -4 or at position -2. The third acetate was also found on the -4 or -2 xylosyl residue. It is notable that acetate was not found at position -3.. To determine the spacing of acetylation of the oligosaccharides from the EcXyn30 xylanase digest of acetylated xylan, oligosaccharides labelled with 2-AA were examined by MALDI-ToF-MS (Figure 3c) and high-energy MALDI-CID (Figure S4). The enzyme released Xyl4Ac2 and Xyl6Ac3 as the main products. MALDI-CID of the Xyl4Ac2 products confirmed the even spacing of the acetyl residues at the -2 and -4 non-reducing end xylose, as seen in the CmXyn10B digest (Figure S4a). MALDI-CID of Xyl6Ac3 showed acetyl groups predominantly at the -2, -4 and -6 xylose residues (Figure S4b). All the MS studies therefore showed a consistent pattern of acetylation on alternate xylosyl residues.. . . NMR indicates that acetylated xylosyl residues are adjacent to non-acetylated residues. Intact gux1 gux2 acetylated xylan was analysed by NMR spectroscopy. Chemical-shift assignments were obtained using 1H-1H two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (TOCSY) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) alongside two-dimensional 13C HSQC, heteronuclear two-bond correlation (H2BC), HSQC-TOCSY and HSQC-NOESY experiments (Table S1). The 2-, 3- and 2,3-O-acetylated Xyl residues (denoted X2, X3 and X23) were readily identified from the characteristic downfield chemical shifts of the H-2 and/or H-3 residues, respectively (Figure 5a). H2BC connections were used to assign intraresidue adjacent 1H and 13C, combined with TOCSY where overlap led to ambiguities. The extra resolution present in the 1H-1H TOCSY and NOESY experiments indicated two highly similar environments for each of X2 and X3, which were in each case barely resolvable except where interglycosidic NOE connectivities differed. Interglycosidic NOE and HMBC connections of X2 and X3 invariably led to non-acetylated Xyl residues (Figure 5b).. . Figure 5. . NMR analysis showing relationship of acetylated and non-acetylated xylosyl residues.

(b) Two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY and TOCSY spectra, shown in blue and red, respectively. Detailed analysis of the NOE cross peaks allows the various non-acetylated xylosyl residues to be distinguished. Key NOEs, connecting inter-residue H1 and H4/H5eq in the 50-ms mixing-time experiment, and H1-H1 in the 200-ms mixing-time experiment, are shown by arrows. Dotted circles highlight the absence of NOEs between: (i) X2 and X3; (ii) non-acetylated Xyl with itself, and (iii) X3 and X3. (c) Anomeric region of two-dimensional 13C HSQC spectra showing the close similarity of chemical shifts in WT and gux1 gux2 acetylated xylan.. . . . Four main non-acetylated Xyl species were observed; one partially overlapping pair showed a (1  4) connection (i.e. towards the reducing end) to X2, whereas a second pair showed a (1  4) connection to X3 (Figure 5b). The species within each pair differed in their non-reducing end connectivity, which was to either X2 or X3. The four non-acetylated Xyl (X) species could thus be identified as the central residue in the four permutations of the triads X2-X-X2, X2-X-X3, X3-X-X2 and X3-X-X3. Following from this, the two closely overlapping signals seen for each of X2 and X3 reflect a long-range sensitivity to the nature of the sugar two residues towards the reducing end, which carries either the same or differing acetylation. A low population of X23 was observed, and although some resonances of a non-acetylated Xyl connected at the non-reducing end could also be assigned, the low intensity and peak overlap precluded further assignment of this species.. No NOE cross-peaks were detected between X2 and X3 (Figure 5b, see dotted circles marked i). Additionally, no NOE cross-peaks were detected between non-acetylated Xyl residues (see dotted circles marked ii). Although it is not impossible that adjacent acetylated or adjacent non-acetylated species exist but overlap to the degree that the interglycosidic connection cannot be distinguished from internal NOE connections, no intense internal H1-H4 NOEs were seen at shorter mixing times (see for example the dotted circle marked iii for X3), indicating that these species, if present, were relatively low in number (the 1  4 NOE would be strong in the presence of a glycosidic linkage). From this we infer that AcXyl-AcXyl and nonAcXyl-nonAcXyl are not present in significant quantities in acetylated gux1 gux2 xylan.. In summary, the NMR data strongly indicate that in gux1 gux2 xylan acetylated residues are largely adjacent to non-acetylated residues, and vice versa, i.e. acetylated xylan is predominantly composed of alternating Xyl and AcXyl units.. . . Acetylation of alternate residues is seen in xylan from extracted Golgi vesicles and from wild-type Arabidopsis stems. The patterning of the acetylation of xylan in the gux1 gux2 plants might arise during biosynthesis in the Golgi, as a result of the specific action of acetyltransferases. Alternatively, the pattern might arise by the removal of specific acetates by esterases in the cell wall. To investigate this, we extracted Golgi-enriched membranes from Arabidopsis inflorescence stems active in xylan synthesis. Xylan in the membranes was digested by CmXyn10B and the oligosaccharides studied by MALDI-ToF-MS. As seen in Figure 3(d), the xylan in the Golgi apparatus has similar acetylation patterns as the xylan in the cell wall.. The WT Arabidopsis xylan has GlcA decorations in addition to acetylation. To determine whether xylan in WT plants also has patterned xylan acetylation, we digested both extracted acetylated xylan and intact cell wall material with CmXyn10B. As seen in Figure 6, acetylated oligosaccharides substituted by GlcA (with or without 4-O-Me) were detected by MALDI-ToF-MS. The oligosaccharides without GlcA substitution were dominated by Xyl4Ac2. MALDI-CID of the 2-AA-labeled Xyl4Ac2 oligosaccharide confirmed the locations of acetate at the -4 and -2 Xyl, as seen in the gux1 gux2 mutants (Figure S5). Similar MS/MS fragmentation results have been very recently shown for MeGlcAXyl4Ac2 (Chong et al., 2014).. . Figure 6. . MALDI-ToF-MS of xylanase-digested wild-type (WT) acetylated xylan. (a) CmXyn10B digest of acetylated xylan extracted from delignified WT stem cell walls. (b) CmXyn10B digestion of WT stem cell wall alcohol-insoluble residue.. . . . The NMR chemical shifts of WT xylan were identical to those of the gux1 gux2 mutant, with the exception of the new peaks arising from GlcA substitutions, implying the same pattern of acetylation. The anomeric regions of the 13C HSQC are shown overlain in Figure 5(c).. . . Molecular dynamics simulations of naked and substituted xylans on cellulose fibrils. As the acetylation and glucuronosylation (Bromley et al., 2013) of a substantial proportion of the xylan follows an evenly spaced pattern, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine whether two-fold helical screw (21-fold) xylan would stably interact with a Ibeta microfibril. The rectangular cross section 24 chain cellulose microfibril has (010) and (020) hydrophilic and (100) and (200) hydrophobic surfaces (Figure S6) (Fernandes et al., 2011; Gomes and Skaf, 2012). The simulations showed that unsubstituted 21-fold xylan has the ability to interact with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces of cellulose, with interaction potential energies ranging from about -100 to -150 kcal mol-1 for a stretch of xylan with DP10 (Tables S2-S5): that is, from -10 to -15 kcal mol-1 per xylosyl residue. Evenly spaced substitution has no statistically significant effect on the interaction energy between different xylans and cellulose on surfaces (010) or (020) (Table S2). On hydrophobic surfaces (100) and (200), adsorption of acetylxylan may be slightly less stable, and glucuronoxylan may be slightly more stable, when compared with unsubstituted xylan. Nevertheless, on all surfaces, with all three different xylans, stable adsorption complexes are formed. Hence, evenly substituted, 21-fold xylan ribbons are energetically feasible candidates for our adsorption model in which xylan molecules adsorb to cellulose surfaces at crystallographic surface vacancies.. We monitored the binding of xylan on cellulose during the course of the simulations. The results for all simulated systems show that, on all surfaces, xylans (unsubstituted, acetylxylan and glucuronoxylan) spend much of the simulation time near the adsorption site (Figure 7a-c, respectively). On the (010) and (100) faces, xylan molecules do not leave their adsorption sites. On the (200) face, the xylan chains behave very similarly, except for an augmented mobility, especially towards its reducing end. On face (020), the xylan molecules exhibit higher mobility towards the non-reducing end, and stretches of the xylan molecules transiently desorb from this surface. The higher mobility resulting from acetylation on the (100) and (200) faces is consistent with the slightly lower interaction energies of acetylxylan with the hydrophobic surfaces (Table S2), as compared with unsubstituted xylan. Faces (010) and (020) are both hydrophilic, and marked differences in xylan adsorption properties on these surfaces are not expected. The differences between xylan adsorption on the (020) and (010) faces seen in Figure 7(a) are the result of a slight tilt of the plane of origin chains in the cellulose microfibril observed during the simulations (Figure S7). It is unclear whether this effect arises from shortcomings of the force field or represents an actual behavioural difference to be expected between origin and centre chains.. . Figure 7. . Molecular dynamics simulation of xylan (a, unsubstituted; b, acetylated; c, glucuronosylated) interacting with hydrophilic (010) and (020), or hydrophobic (100) and (200), surfaces of cellulose. Occupancy-level isosurfaces are shown. Dark- and light-coloured isosurfaces represent spatial regions where substituted xylan is present 40-50% and 20% of the simulation time, respectively.. . . . . . Influence of substitutions on docked xylan interaction with water. The MD simulations show that xylan acetylation has little effect on its interaction energy with water, whereas GlcA residues on xylan strongly stabilize its interaction with water by about -400 kcal mol-1 (Table S3). This energy difference largely arises from the electrostatic contribution. The strong interaction with water has little or no effect on the interaction energy of glucuronoxylan with cellulose, compared with unsubstituted xylan (Table S4). Similarly, acetyl moieties in evenly spaced acetylated xylan also do not affect the interaction energy of xylan with the (010) cellulose surface, but in this case acetyl moieties alone confer little stabilization to the interaction with surrounding water (Table S5). The results in Tables S4 and S5 thus indicate that the evenly spaced chemical functionalization of xylan allows the tuning of interactions between xylan and the surrounding medium, without compromising the interaction of xylan with cellulose hydrophilic surfaces.. . . Xylan exhibits a 21-fold helical screw when adsorbed onto cellulose surfaces, and a 31-fold helical screw in water. The sum of dihedrals phi and psi at a particular glycosidic oxygen is indicative of local glycan conformation at that oxygen (Mazeau et al., 2005; French and Johnson, 2009). In particular, for beta-(1-4)-linked glycans, if the sum phi + psi equals 120 at all glycosidic oxygens, such glycan displays a 21 helical conformation along the whole polymeric chain. The glycan assumes threefold helical, 31, conformation when phi + psi equals 50 (right handed) or 190 (left handed) at all glycosidic oxygens. Results of MD simulations of a free xylan molecule in water, shown in Figure 8(a), indicate that in water the distribution of phi + psi is centred around 190, consistent with a 31-fold screw. For xylan adsorbed to surface (010), in contrast, the phi + psi distribution is centred at 120 (Figure 8b), indicative of twofold helical conformations. As xylan on face (010) does not leave its adsorption groove during simulations (Figure 7a), the 21 conformations correspond to adsorbed xylan. Xylan adsorbed to the other crystallite surfaces also showed a population with a phi + psi distribution centred at 120, particularly for the internal xylosyl residues (Figure S8). On the (020) and (200) faces a population with a phi + psi distribution centred at 190 was also observed.. . Figure 8. . Xylan in 31- and 21-fold screw conformations. Histograms showing the distribution of glycosidic dihedral angles phi + psi between adjacent xylose residues of unsubstituted xylan of DP10. Numbers refer to xylose residues. (a) Xylan in water: phi + psi  190 in water indicates threefold (31) helical conformation. (b) xylan on cellulose face 010. phi + psi  120 indicates twofold (21) conformation.. . . . On surface (020), xylosyl residues transiently desorb (Figure 7a), making incursions into the water bulk. This behaviour is reflected in the scatter plot of the xylan phi + psi sum against the xylan-glucan interchain separation, dO-O, shown in Figure 9(a). For small separations, the sum of dihedrals is centred at 120, whereas for higher values of dO-O, phi + psi is centred at 190. These results indicate that local 21 conformations correspond to adsorbed xylosyl residues, whereas 31 conformations correspond to stretches of desorbed xylan interacting with water.. . Figure 9. . Neighboring xylan and glucan chains for xylan (DP10) adsorbed on the hydrophilic faces of cellulose. (a) Scattered plot of the interchain distance against the sum of dihedrals phi + psi, showing that when the chains are close to each other (xylan adsorbed onto cellulose) only xylosyl twofold screw, 21, conformations occur, whereas when the chains are farther apart, xylan assumes a threefold screw, 31, conformation. (b) The predominant xylan-glucan hydrogen-bonding mode has xylosyl O2 as the proton donor and glucosyl O6 as the proton acceptor.. . . . . . Evenly spaced substitution does not disrupt the hydrogen-bonding network between xylan and hydrophilic cellulose surfaces. When adsorbed to cellulose hydrophilic surfaces (010) and (020), xylan establishes several hydrogen bonds to the cellulose molecule directly above or below it. The overall trend for xylan molecule M0, on face (010), is that alternate residues (residues 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8) hydrogen-bond to cellulose chain M4. For the intervening non-hydrogen-bonded xylosyl residues, the O2 and O3 major candidates for hydrogen-bonding are pointed away from the cellulose fibril, as shown in Figure 9(b). The trend is similar for xylan M25 on face (020).. Hydrogen-bonding statistics computed from the MD trajectories (Tables S6 and S7) reveal that the predominant xylan-cellulose hydrogen-bond mode takes place with xylosyl O2 as proton donors and glucosyl O6 as acceptors. At times, this relationship may be inverted, with xylosyl O2 acting as acceptors and glucosyl O6 as donors. In the very short time intervals when cellulose O6 is not bonding to xylan O2, it establishes hydrogen bonds with xylan O3 and, at times, cellulose O6 may interact with both xylan O2 and O3 simultaneously. From these observations we conclude that cellulose O6 is paramount for hydrogen bonding between cellulose and xylan. The pattern of even substitution on xylan preserves the original hydrogen-bond network between xylan and hydrophilic cellulose surfaces. As the substituted hydroxyls in xylan point outwards from the cellulose crystallite, hydroxyls involved in hydrogen bonding are not disturbed by the even substitution pattern..
PMC3198771	Results. . PORC-overexpressing Arabidopsis leaves exhibited greener phenotype. We generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing PORC cDNA (PORCx) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter having omega (omega) translational enhancer (Figure 1A). Protein levels of PORC in four-week-old WT and PORCx (T9, T12, T13) plants were analyzed using the PORC monoclonal antibody (Figure 1B). The PORCx lines had higher protein expression (1.5-3 folds) of the trans-gene (Figure 1C). They had increased Chl content i.e., up to 28% over that of WT plants and had also a little higher carotenoid content (Figure 1D). The PORCx plants/leaves look greener than WT plants (Figure 1G, H). LHC II protein was increased in PORCx plants by 33% and 58% respectively (Figure 1E, F).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026532.g001. Figure 1. . Transformation of Arabidopsis by using AtPORC cDNA.. (A) TDNA region of modified pCAMBIA1304 - 35Somega AtporC. (B) Western blot of PORC in WT and PORCx plants (T-9, T-12, T-13). Thylakoids were isolated from WT and PORCx plants grown for 4-weeks under 14 h L/10 h D photoperiod (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) at 22C2C and thirty g of thylakoid proteins were loaded in each lane of SDS-PAGE. Western blot was done using PORC (1:1000) monoclonal antiserum (top panel). The bottom panel shows coomassie-stained gel for equal loading. Before coomassie staining, the membrane was probed with RbcL antibody (1:20000) and the respective protein was identified by Western blot.

(G) Phenotypic differences of Arabidopsis WT and T-13 plants after 4-weeks of growth at 22C2C under 14 h L/10 h D photoperiod (100 moles photons m-2 s-1). As the T-13 plant has higher PORC amount and higher Chl content, we have only shown its picture. Notice the T-13 plants were greener and slightly smaller than the WT plants. (H) Leaves were excised from 18 days old and 28 days old WT and T-13 plants and photographed.. . . . . . PORC expression modulated gene expression and protein abundance of enzymes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis. The increased amount of Chl in PORCx led us to study if the over-expression of PORC modulated the gene expression and protein abundance of other Chl biosynthetic pathway enzymes. We performed semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and found the transcript abundance of GluTR, GSAT, UROD and CHLP increased respectively by 38%, 80%, 67% and 36% in T-12 and 90%, 110%, 130% and 60% in T-13 PORCx lines (Figure 2A, B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026532.g002. Figure 2. . RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of Chl biosynthetic enzymes in PORCx plants.. (A) The gene expression study of the Chl biosynthetic pathway enzymes in T-12 and T-13 plants was done by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis using the gene specific primer pairs for each enzyme as described in materials and methods. ACT1 was used as an internal control. Fifteen l of the PCR products were loaded and separated on 1% agarose Tris-acetate EDTA gel. Ethidium bromide-stained PCR products were quantified using the Alpha Imager 3400. (B) Bar diagram of gene expression (%). Rate of expression is represented as percentage of control (WT). The data presented are representative of three independent experiments. (C) Immunoblot analysis of Chl biosynthetic pathway proteins was carried out using plastid proteins isolated from WT and T-12, T-13 plants. (D) Bar diagram of protein expression (%) of different enzymes and the rate of expression is represented as percentage of control (WT). Each data point is the average of three replicates and the error bar represents SD.. . . . To understand the correlation between the gene expression and protein abundance of Chl biosynthetic enzymes, the Western blot analysis of a few Chl biosynthesis enzymes was performed (Figure 2C, D). As compared to WT, the protein abundance of GluTR, GSAT, UROD and CPO were enhanced, respectively, by 40%, 25%, 20% and 42% in T-12 and 72%, 87%, 111% and 50% in T-13 PORCx plants.. . . PORCx plants have higher POR activity and reduced chlorophyll intermediates in light. To measure the PORC activity, four-week-old light-grown WT and PORCx plants were kept in dark for 14 h followed by 10 min light exposure (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) and then the photo-transformation of Pchlide was measured. Although a single saturating flash illumination is quite efficient for the transformation of photo-transformable Pchlide pool to Chlide in etiolated tissues, it is not sufficient in light-grown green tissues, for the conversion of non-photo- transformable Pchlide. Actually, exposure of plants to light for several minutes/hours was used before to monitor the disappearance of Pchlide [2], [5], [7], [28]. After 10 min light exposure the Pchlide content was reduced to a greater extent in PORCx plants compared to WT plants; the percentage of phototransformation in WT was 61%, whereas in PORCx T-12 and T-13 plants it was 82% and 89% respectively (Figure 3A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026532.g003. Figure 3. . POR activity, ALA content and steady state Chl biosynthesis intermediates of WT and PORCx plants.. (A) Photoperiodically (14 h L/10 h D) grown 4-week-old WT and PORCx (T-12, T-13) plants were incubated in dark for 14 h and their protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) contents were determined in dark. After dark incubation, plants were exposed to light (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) for 10 min and their Pchlide contents were monitored and phtotransformation of Pchlide to chlorophyllide was determined. (B) Net accumulation of ALA from endogenous substrates of leaves harvested from WT and PORCx (T-12, T-13) plants. (C) Steady state tetrapyrrole contents of WT and PORCx plants. Leaf samples were harvested from photoperiodically (14 h L/10 h D) grown plants during the light phase (7 h after beginning of light cycle), homogenized immediately in light and the chlorophyll biosynthetic tetrapyrroles (Pchlide, Proto IX and MP(E)) contents were estimated. The experiments were repeated for 3 times and each data point is the average of 6 replicates. The error bar represents  SD.. . . . Efficient photo-transformation of Pchlide to Chlide in PORCx plants decreases Pchlide contents and consequently releases the feed back inhibition of ALA biosynthesis. This resulted in increased ALA synthesis in light-exposed PORCx plants (Figure 3B). The extent of overnight Pchlide accumulation by both WT and PORCx plants before the end of dark period was quite similar (Figure 3A) although the latter had a greater Chl biosynthesis potential (Figure 2A, C); this is because of feed-back inhibition of ALA synthesis by Pchlide [29], [30]. Due to their enhanced Chl biosynthesis potential, the rate of synthesis of Pchlide and its binding to POR in dark is likely to be higher in PORCx plants than that of WT. Once certain amounts of Pchlide accumulate either in WT or in PORCx, it would exert the feed-back inhibition on ALA synthesis and consequently, its own synthesis would be down regulated. Because of the efficient assembly of POR-Pchlide complex due to increased abundance of POR protein, the feed-back down regulation of synthesis of ALA and consequently that of Pchlide may occur faster in PORCx plants than that of WT. However, prolonged i.e., overnight accumulation of Pchlide would be similar both in WT and PORCx plants. Enhanced POR activity as well as increase in gene and protein expression of several Chl biosynthesis enzymes in PORCx plants resulted in efficient conversion of Chl biosynthetic intermediates (Proto IX, MPE and Pchlide) to Chl leading to their decreased accumulation in PORCx (T-12 and T-13) plants under steady state illumination (Figure 3C).. Since T-13 line had higher Chl content, gene and protein expression, POR activity and lower tetrapyrrole accumulation under steady-state illumination than that in T-12, the T-13 line was further characterized in detail.. . . PORCx plants are resistant to high light. PORC expression increases with increasing light intensity [23], [27]. To understand the significance of increased expression of PORC in high light, T-13 plants were exposed to high light (350 mumoles photons m-2 s-1, 16 h light/8 h dark) as described in experimental procedures to know if it could protect plants from light-stress.. . . Plant morphology and their photosystem II quantum yield (Fv/Fm). After 6-7 days of low light (LL; 50 mumoles photons m-2 s-1) exposure there was no significant difference in the phenotype of WT and T-13 plants (Figure 4A). However, in high light (HL; 350 mumoles photons m-2 s-1) several leaves of the WT plants looked purple (Figure 4A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026532.g004. Figure 4. . Morphological and physiological responses of WT and PORCx plants to light stress.. Both WT and PORCx (T-13) plants were grown in light (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) for 22-24 days and subsequently transferred to low-light (LL) (50 moles photons m-2 s-1, 16 h light/8 h dark) or high-light (HL) (330 moles photons m-2 s-1, 16 h light/8 h dark) regimes for 6-7 d as described in experimental procedures. (A) Photographs of WT and T-13 plants after 6-7 d of transfer to LL and HL. (B) Photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) of leaves of LL- and HL- exposed plants was monitored by PAM 2100 fluorometer. Values are mean  SD (n=20). (C) Anthocyanin contents of WT and T-13 plants grown under HL. (D) The gene expression study of CHS in HL-grown WT and T-13 plants was done by RT-PCR as described in experimental procedures. AtACT1 was used as an internal control. (E) Pchlide contents of HL-treated WT and T-13 plants measured 10 min after the end of dark period. (F) Singlet oxygen (1O2) contents in WT and T-13 plants. Thylakoid membranes were isolated in complete darkness from HL- exposed plants and the 1O2 production was determined in terms of RNO bleaching using histidine as a trap. (G) Malondealdehyde (MDA) production in HL- treated WT and T-13 plants. Each data point represented in all the above experiments is the average of 6 replicates. The error bar represents SD.. . . . Chl a fluorescence is a signature of photosynthetic reactions. The ratio of variable fluorescence (Fv) to maximum fluorescence (Fm) is a measure of quantum yield of photosystem II (PS II) [31]. To understand if light-stress affects photosynthesis, the Fv/Fm ratio was monitored in WT and T-13 plants. The minimal fluorescence F0 was not affected by LL or HL. In LL, the Fv/Fm ratio of both WT and T-13 plants was identical (0.8) demonstrating that not only plant morphology but also their photosynthetic efficiency was similar. In HL-stress, the Fv/Fm ratio was substantially reduced to 0.65 in WT plants indicating the quantum yield of PSII was severely affected. Under identical conditions in T-13 plants, the Fv/Fm ratio was normal (0.8) (Figure 4B) demonstrating that PORC overexpression protected plants from HL.. . . Anthocyanin accumulation, chalcone synthase expression, 1O2 production, pchlide accumulation and malondialdehyde content. Under stressful conditions, particularly in high light stress, plants accumulate anthocyanin. As compared to PORCx plants, WT plants accumulated higher amounts of anthocyanin (Figure 4C) and as expected the gene expression of chalcone synthase (CHS), one of the enzymes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, was higher in WT plants as compared to PORCx (Figure 4D).. CHS expression changes in response to 1O2 generation [32]. To understand if increased CHS expression in HL-treated WT plants is associated with the generation of 1O2, the latter was monitored by RNO (N, N-dimethyl-p-nitrosoaniline) bleaching reaction [5]. 1O2 generation was higher in thylakoids of WT plants than that in T-13 plants exposed to light-stress (Figure 4F). Reduced 1O2 production in HL-stressed T-13 plants was due to reduced steady state accumulation of the photosensitizer Pchlide (Figure 4E). Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an index of lipid peroxidation that is one of the phototoxic consequences of 1O2-mediated oxidative stress. Reduced 1O2 generation in light-stressed- T-13 plants resulted in reduced MDA production than that in WT (Figure 4G).. . . PORC overexpression protects plants from oxidative herbicidal action of ALA. ALA is the precursor of Pchlide, which acts like a herbicide in presence of light [2], [4]. Exogenous application of 3 mM ALA to both WT and PORCx plants (28-32 days old plants grown under 14 h light/10 h dark photoperiod) at sunset resulted in overnight (14 h) over-accumulation of Chl biosynthetic intermediates i.e., Pchlide, Proto IX and MP(E) (Figure 5A). Pchlide regulates its own accumulation via feedback inhibition of ALA biosynthesis [29], [30]. Treatment of plants with ALA bypasses this regulatory site. Therefore, the feed-back regulation of ALA synthesis by Pchlide is ineffective in the presence of exogenous ALA. In contrast to data reported in Figure 3A, where overnight Pchlide accumulation in non-treated WT and PORCx plants is almost equal (because of tight feedback regulation of ALA synthesis by Pchilde), the ALA-treated transgenic plants accumulated higher amounts of Pchlide than that of WT as ALA treatment bypasses the feedback regulatory site and PORCx plants have higher Chl biosynthesis potential, as revealed by higher gene and protein expression of their Chl biosynthetic pathway enzymes. Angiosperms are incapable of converting Pchlide to Chlide in dark. Therefore, only after 10 min of light (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) exposure, the Pchlide content of both WT and T-13 plants declined due to light-dependent transformation of Pchlide to Chlide (Figure 5B). However, Pchlide content of ALA-treated and light exposed T-13 plants were significantly lower than that of WT (Figure 5B). This was due to higher efficiency of phototransformation of Pchlide in PORCx plants (76%) as compared to that for WT (30%).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026532.g005. Figure 5. . Chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway intermediate contents and 1O2 production in ALA-treated WT and PORCx plants.. WT and T-13 plants grown for 28-32 days at 22C2C under 14 h L/10 h D photoperiod (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) were sprayed with ALA (3 mM), dark incubaed for 14 h and exposed to light (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) for 10 min. Leaves were harvested both from dark incubated and light exposed plants, homogenized and their tetrapyrrole contents were monitored by spectrofluorometrically. (A) Pchlide, Proto IX and MP(E) contents of ALA-treated (3 mM) and 14 h-dark-incubated WT and T-13 plants. (B) After dark incubation both WT and T-13 plants were exposed to light (10 min) and their Pchlide, Proto IX and MP(E) were determined. (C) 1O2 contents in ALA-treated (+ALA) and untreated (-ALA) WT and T-13 plants. The experiments were repeated 5 times and each data point is the average of 5 replicates. The error bar represents  SD.. . . . . . Reduced tetrapyrrole accumulation in PORCx plants resulted in decreased 1O2 production. The generation of 1O2 from the thylakoid membranes (both dark and light exposed samples) was almost linear till 30 min of light exposure in thylakoid membranes isolated from ALA-treated (3 mM) WT as well as T-13 plants. However, due to reduced accumulation of the photosensitizers Pchlide and other Chl biosynthetic intermediates in light-exposed PORCx plants the generation of 1O2 was nearly half of that of WT (Figure 5C). In untreated (-ALA) plants, due to highly reduced presence of Chl biosynthetic intermediates, 1O2 generation was much smaller both in WT and T-13 plants.. . . ALA-treated plants did not over-produce excess super oxide (O2-). It is essential to ascertain if in addition to 1O2, O2- was also generated in light-exposed ALA-treated plants. Tetrapyrroles could produce O2- via type I photosensitization reaction where the triplet sensitizer could directly react with the substrate to generate O2- [1]. Therefore, O2- accumulation was studied in dark and light exposed thylakoid membranes isolated from control and ALA-treated WT plants by cytochrome C reduction assay as described in methods. As shown in Table 1, the amount of O2- generated by thylakoids isolated from control and ALA-treated plants was almost similar. The O2- produced by the control and treated sample in light was abolished by DCMU (3-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)-1, 1-dimethylurea), an inhibitor acting at the reducing side of PSII of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. This suggests that the production of O2- in control and ALA-treated samples had its origin mostly from the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Mehler reaction is mostly observed in isolated thylakoid membranes at the acceptor side of photosystem I (PS I) [33] that generates O2- using H2O as the source of electron. Therefore, addition of DCMU that blocks H2O oxidation by PS II blocked the generation of O2- via Mehler reaction in PSI. These experiments demonstrate that type I photosensitization reaction of plant tetrapyrroles is not involved in O2- generation in light-exposed ALA-treated plants and most O2- generated in control or ALA-treated plants had their origin from the electron transport chain.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026532.t001.

The thylakoid membranes were illuminated by incandescent light (500 moles photons m-2 s-1) passed through heat and neutral density filters. O2- generation by the thylakoid membranes was monitored as cytochrome C reduction.. . . . . . Tolerance of PORCx plants to oxidative damage caused by the photodynamic herbicide. To study the tolerance of PORCx plants to ALA-induced oxidative damage, WT and T-13 plants were sprayed with 3 mM ALA, kept in dark for 14 h and then exposed to light (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) for different time periods. The leaves of ALA-treated WT plants started wilting after 2 h of light exposure and they were severely damaged after 6-12 h of illumination (Figure 6A). After 24 h of continuous light exposure WT plants were completely bleached. Under identical conditions PORCx plants were tolerant to the 1O2-induced oxidative stress (Figure 6A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026532.g006. Figure 6. . PORCx plants are tolerant to ALA-inducd oxidative damage.. WT and PORCx (T-13) plants were treated with ALA and exposed to light for different time periods. (A) Photographs of T-13 plants under ALA-induced oxidative damage. Notice the death of the WT plants after 24 h of light exposure, whereas T-13 plants are slightly damaged. (B) Survival of light-exposed T-13 plants treated with different concentration of ALA. Both WT and T-13 plants grown under the same condition as described above were treated with different concentration of ALA (from 1 mM to 5 mM) and their dose dependent tolerance was observed. Notice the WT plants were killed by 3 mM or 5 mM ALA-treatment.. . . . To understand the dose-dependence of herbicidal action on WT and T-13 plants they were sprayed with 1, 3, 5 or 10 mM ALA and were kept in dark for 14 h to accumulate the photosensitizer Pchlide and were then exposed to light (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) for 10 days (14 h L/10 h D). After 10 days of light exposure, both WT and PORCx plants treated with 1 mM of ALA survived. However, the WT plants had more necrotic leaves than that of T-13 plants (Figure 6B). WT plants treated with 3 or 5 mM of ALA perished whereas the T-13 plants survived and produced flowers (Figure 6B). At 10 mM ALA, both WT as well as T-13 plants perished (not shown).. . . Fv/Fm, electron transport chain, electrolyte leakage, and MDA content. To ascertain if ALA-induced oxidative stress affected photosynthetic quantum yield, Fv/Fm ratio was monitored in ALA-treated WT and PORCx plants. The Fv/Fm ratio of dark-incubated ALA-treated WT plants were reduced by 32%, 46%, and 63% respectively after 1 h, 2 h and 6 h of light exposure. Under identical conditions PORCx plants had no substantial decrease of Fv/Fm ratio (Figure 7A). There was no change in initial F0 fluorescence in WT and PORCx plants up to 6 h of light exposure.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026532.g007. Figure 7. . Physiological responses of PORCx plants to ALA-mediated oxidative stress.. Both WT and T-13 plants were grown and treated with ALA (3 mM) and leaf samples were taken for analysis immediately prior (0 h) or after different duration of light (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) exposure. (A) Fv/Fm ratio and electron transport rate (B, C) of ALA-treated light exposed WT and T-13 plants as monitored by PAM 2100 fluorometer and values are mean  SD (n=20). (D) Ion leakage as a measure of damage to plasma membrane in ALA-treated light exposed WT and T-13 plants. (E) MDA contents of ALA-treated light exposed WT and T-13 plants. All the above experiments were performed thrice and each data point is the average of 3 replicates. The error bar represents  SD.. . . . The electron transport rate (ETR) of PSII increased in response to photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) (moles photons m-2 s-1) (Figure 7B, C). ALA-sprayed WT plants, exposed to light for 2 h had 55% reduction in ETR and the latter was almost abolished in ALA-sprayed WT plants after 6 h of light exposure (Figure 7B, C). Under identical conditions the ETR of PORCx plants was not substantially affected. There was only a partial loss (15%) of ETR of 6 h light exposed PORCx plants (Figure 7B, C).. To ascertain if 1O2 -induced injury to the photosynthetic apparatus resulted in ultimate damage to the plasma membrane and consequent destruction of cellular integrity, changes in the conductivity of the bathing medium of leaf discs excised from ALA-treated and light-exposed WT and T-13 plants were measured. Increase in conductivity of the bathing medium was observed in leaf discs of ALA-treated WT plants within 30 min of light (100 moles photons m-2 s-1) exposure and this increase continued up to 6 h. In comparison to WT, the leaf discs excised from ALA-treated T-13 plants had reduced (50%) ion leakage (Figure 7D).. The loss of plasma membrane integrity was due to increased membrane lipid peroxidation in WT plants. The contents of MDA, the lipid peroxidation product increased in ALA-treated WT plants after 2 h of light treatment. However, in PORCx plants MDA production was less i.e., nearly half of that of WT suggesting that membrane lipid peroxidation was substantially reduced in transgenics (Figure 7E). As expected the Fv/Fm ratio, the ETR, electrolyte leakage or MDA production in untreated light-exposed samples or ALA-treated dark incubated samples were not affected..
PMC3792037	Results. . Root hairs of xik mutants grow more slowly and stop growing sooner than root hairs of wild type. Four T-DNA insertion mutants of XIK (At5g20490) from the SALK collection [31] were isolated and their T-DNA insertion site confirmed by genomic PCR (Figure S1A). Among them, xik-1 and xik-3 were identified as knockout mutants by RT-PCR in agreement with reports by other groups [9,10], while two new insertion alleles in the promoter region (xik-6 and xik-7; Figure S1A) still expressed the transcript (data not shown). The presence of a strong root hair phenotype in xik-6 suggests potential differences in expression levels that should be investigated in the future. A full-length cDNA was assembled from two independent EST clones. Its sequence (GenBank accession number JN229265) corresponded to the major transcript identified by deep sequencing (HQ427882) [43] and included a different 5 end from the previous annotations (NM_001161252 and NM_122056). In particular, the transcriptional start site was approximately 200 bp further upstream and a different splice acceptor site was utilized for the first intron when compared to NM_001161252. As a result, the encoded protein had a different N-terminus that included only a short extension upstream of a SH3-like domain. Thus, the gene structure of XIK appears to be similar to other plant myosin XI genes with a long first intron (831 bp) that follows immediately after the start codon.. Under our conditions, root hairs of xik-3 (referred as xik below) usually grew to about 50-60% of root hair length in wild type, consistent with previous reports [9,10]. This phenotype could have resulted from two different mechanisms: mutant root hairs might have grown normally but stopped growing earlier than wild type, or they might have grown more slowly than wild type for the same duration. To distinguish between these possibilities, root hair growth rates were measured over time at high resolution on the microscope stage. This experiment was repeated four times per genotype and one representative result is shown in Figure 1. Under these conditions, xik mutants grew for 4-5 hours while wild type grew for up to about 6 hours (Figure 1D). Both wild type and mutants showed growth rate oscillations as reported previously [44]. As root hairs got older, their growth rate declined and eventually reached zero. However, comparison of growth rates of root hairs of similar age revealed that growth rates of xik were much lower than those of wild type (Figure 1B). Maximum root hair growth rate in xik under these conditions was 1.47 mum/min while wild type reached a maximum growth rate of 2.33 mum/min suggesting that root hairs in xik grew more slowly from the beginning (Figure 1C). Overall, average growth rates were 1.26 0.02 mum/min and 0.74 0.01 mum/min (SE) in wild type and xik, respectively (one way ANOVA, p< 0.001). In addition, xik stopped growing more than one hour earlier than wild type (Figure 1D, black arrows). Thus, xik mutants produced shorter root hairs than wild type because of a reduced growth rate as well as premature cessation of growth.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0076745.g001. Figure 1. . Root hairs grow more slowly in xik mutants.. (a) Time series of DIC images of Col-0 and xik. Delay between images 6 min. Size bar indicates 15 mum. Young Col-0 root hairs (length < 200 m) grew faster than those about to stop growing (length > 500 m), compare first and third column. By contrast, young xik root hairs grew slowly and similarly to mature root hairs in Col-0 (compare second and third column).. (b) Comparison of root hair growth rates over 60 min. Dark green line shows WT root hair growth rate of young root hairs, while light green indicates long WT root hairs. Magenta line shows the growth rate of a young root hair of xik.. (c) Growth rates measured over 360 min reveal that root hairs in xik consistently grew more slowly than those of WT and eventually stopped growing earlier than in WT. Green line shows a root hair from a WT seedling, while magenta line indicates an individual root hair from a xik seedling.. (d) Total root hair length over time for a xik root hair (magenta line) and a wild type root hair (green line). Arrows indicate approximate time point of cessation of growth.. . . . . . RabA4b vesicles accumulate similarly in WT and xik root hairs. YFP-RabA4b associates with secretory vesicles that accumulate in the tip of growing root hairs and thus can be used as a marker for growth [7,8]. Since root hairs in xik mutants were growing more slowly and stopped growing earlier than in wild type, the effect of the xik mutation on YFP-RabA4b accumulation was observed. Root hairs from both wild type and xik mutants clearly displayed accumulation of YFP-RabA4b at the tip of growing root hairs (Figure 2A). A direct comparison of the level of YFP-RabA4b accumulation was not possible since high variation in expression levels even among root hairs of the same root (data not shown) prevented quantitative comparisons of wild type and mutant. To investigate the effect of the xik mutation on the accumulation of YFP-RabA4b in greater detail, YFP fluorescence at the tip of root hairs was monitored over time using an automated algorithm that tracked the root hair tip during growth (Figure S2). Interestingly, tip accumulation of YFP-RabA4b in both wild type and xik frequently displayed a stochastic loss and recovery at the tip of root hairs (Figure 2B and Movie S1 online). Coefficients of variation at the tip of xik root hairs were slightly higher but not significantly different from those of wild type (t-test: p= 0.1945, Figure 2C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0076745.g002. Figure 2. . Accumulation of RabA4b at the tip of growing root hairs is not significantly affected in xik mutants.. (a) Time series of YFP-RabA4b images of Col-0 and xik. Accumulation of YFP-RabA4b at the tip of growing root hairs fluctuated similarly in both Col-0 and in xik. Delay between images 1 min; also see Movie S1. Size bar indicates 10 mum.. (b) Fluctuation of normalized fluorescence intensity of YFP-RabA4b during 10 min. Green line indicates data from Col-0 while magenta line indicates xik. Intensity fluctuations in xik were similar to those in Col-0.. (c) Coefficients of variation of YFP-RabA4b accumulation in the tip. Every dot represents data from one root hair (n=15; Col-0, n=13; xik). Means of coefficients of variation were not significantly different in the two genotypes (t test, p > 0.05).. . . . In addition, several other markers for membranes and the cytoskeleton were observed in xik mutants (listed in Table S1). In general, we did not observe clear differences in marker distribution between WT and xik root hairs. For example, the ER marker, ER-cb [40], showed the same distribution in WT and mutant root hairs (Figure S4A). Similarly, YFP-PHFAPP1, which binds to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the plasma membrane as well as to some intracellular vesicles [45], showed indistinguishable localization in the two genotypes (Figure S4B).. . . Actin dynamics are reduced in xik root hairs. Recent reports demonstrate that motor proteins can affect organization of the actin cytoskeleton [25,29]. To examine possible effects of xik in root hairs, actin organization in growing root hairs was visualized by decoration with YFP-FABD2 [46]. This marker labels the long filaments and cables along the shank of a root hair but does not label the fine actin filaments behind the growing tip [47]. Overall organization of the actin filaments was similar in xik and in wild type (Figure 3A), as has previously been reported for leaf petiole epidermal cells [29]. This arrangement of actin filaments, however, was not static. Time-lapse analysis revealed dramatic lateral displacements of actin cables that often appeared to travel like waves through the cell. Interestingly, these dynamic rearrangements of actin filaments appeared to be reduced in xik root hairs (Movie S2). Quantitative analysis of these dynamics by measuring the decay of image cross-correlation over time (see Methods and Figure S5) revealed that actin movements were significantly reduced in the mutant (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.01; Figure 3B). Thus, myosin XIK is required for normal dynamic behavior of actin filaments, but is not necessary for normal organization of actin filaments in the root hair shank.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0076745.g003. Figure 3. . Actin filament dynamics are reduced in xik root hairs.. (A) Actin filament organization as labeled with YFP-FABD2 is similar in xik and Col-0. Images are single frames from time-lapse observations in cells Col-3 and xik-3 in panel B, respectively.. (B) Actin filament activity in wild type (Col) and mutant (xik) root hair cells (see Movie S2) as determined by the decay of image cross-correlation with increasing time intervals (for details see Figure S2). Box-and-whiskers plot indicate median, 25th and 75th percentile, as well as minimal and maximal decay constants for the ten most active regions in a given cell. Mean activity levels in Col-0 are significantly higher than in xik (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.01).. . . . . . XIKpro:YFP-XIK can complement the xik mutant phenotype. To gain a better understanding of the involvement of XIK-driven movements in root hair tip growth, it is necessary to identify the cargo of XIK. As a first step towards this goal, we wanted to determine the intracellular localization of XIK. Thus, a wild type XIK cDNA was cloned behind the coding region of YFP and transformed into xik mutants under the control of its native promoter (XIKpro:YFP-XIK, Figure S1A). Three individual transgenic lines were identified and their root hair length was measured. In all cases, XIKpro:YFP-XIK could complement xik root hair growth (Figure 4A). The average length of XIKpro:YFP-XIK xik root hairs was 0.64  0.006 mm (SE, n=660, Figure 4B), which is slightly longer than that of wild type (0.61  0.004 mm; n=370; t-test, p<0.0001), while xik produced significantly shorter root hairs (0.32  0.06 mm, n=370; t-test, p<0.0001). In addition, root hair growth rates were increased back to those of wild type (Figure 4C). While the average growth rate of growing root hairs in xik was 0.85  0.01 m/min (SE, n= 11 root hairs; 1080 time points), XIKpro:YFP-XIK xik showed an average growth rate of 1.64  0.02 m/min (SE, n=16 root hairs; 471 time points), which is slightly higher than in wild type (1.52  0.01 m/min, SE, n= 13 root hairs; 1350 time points; t-test between wild type and XIKpro:YFP-XIK xik, p<0.05, while t-test between xik-3 and XIKpro:YFP-XIK xik, p<0.0001). These results confirmed that the slower growth of root hairs in xik mutants resulted from the lack of XIK motor proteins. In addition, this also established that the YFP-XIK fusion protein could function normally in plants, which implies that these transgenic plants could be used to observe normal XIK localization in cells.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0076745.g004. Figure 4. . YFP-XIK can rescue the short root hair phenotype in xik.. (A) Root hairs of XIKpro:YFP-XIK. xik-3 seedlings displayed long root hairs similar to those of Col-0. Pictures were taken with five day old seedlings grown on vertical growth media solidified with phytagel.. (B) Lengths of mature root hairs. Root hairs of XIKpro:YFP-XIK. xik-3 showed similar length as those of wild type (n=730 Col-0; n=370 xik-3; n=660 XIKpro:YFP-XIK. xik-3). Error bars represent standard error of the mean.. (C) Average growth rate of root hairs in XIKpro:YFP-XIK. xik-3 was similar to those of Col-0. Growth rates were measured in 10 second intervals (n=1350 Col-0; n=1080 xik-3; n=471 XIKpro:YFP-XIK. xik-3). Error bars represent standard error of the mean.. . . . . . YFP-XIK accumulation at the tip of growing root hairs depends on actin filaments. YFP-XIK signal was low in all tissues examined, suggesting that XIK myosin protein levels are generally low in plant cells. Interestingly, relatively high accumulation of YFP was observed at the tip of growing root hairs (Figure 5). This accumulation of YFP-XIK was stable while root hairs were growing (Movie S3), but disappeared when root hairs were fully grown (data not shown and [30]). Occasionally, distinct small spots appeared in the shank of root hairs that moved both towards and away from the tip (arrows in Figure 5).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0076745.g005. Figure 5. . YFP-XIK accumulates at the tip of growing root hairs.. Stable transgenic plants of XIKpro:YFP-XIK in xik-3 background showed maximal accumulation of YFP signal in the subapex of growing root hairs. Weaker accumulation occurred in the extreme tip (arrow heads). YFP-XIK labeled vesicles are difficult to distinguish at the tip while they are easier to detect in the shank of root hairs (arrows). Images are representative frames from a 30 minute time-lapse observation (see Movie S3). Size bar indicates 10 mum.. . . . To test whether the tip accumulation of YFP-XIK resulted from functional XIK movement along actin filaments to deliver its cargo to the tip of a growing root hair, the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin B (LatB) was used to observe the effect of actin filament disruption on the localization of YFP-XIK. We employed a relatively low concentration of LatB (100 nM) that was sufficient to stop root hair growth within 5 to 7 minutes (compare Figure 6D). Consistent with previous reports [48], actin organization in the tip region of growing root hairs was rapidly altered in all 10 cells we observed (right column in Figure 6; Movie S5). Interestingly, short actin filaments appeared in the apical region that normally excluded this marker (Figure 6B, C), similar to what has been described for pollen tubes [49]. These clearly detectable filaments were accompanied by a general increase in YFP signal intensity in this area (Figure 6E, F), suggesting that additional filaments were formed that were accessible to the YFP-FABD2 marker but that could not be resolved by epifluorescence. The presence of YFP-FABD2 signal in this area of the root hair indicates that the typical fine actin mesh that normally occupies the subapical region [47] was disrupted by the LatB treatment. Long actin filaments in the shank were replaced with shorter filaments only after longer treatment times, typically after growth had already stopped (data not shown), suggesting that these filaments were relatively stable and turned over only slowly.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0076745.g006. Figure 6. . Treatment with the actin depolymerizing drug, LatB, disrupts YFP-XIK accumulation at the tip.. Root hairs expressing YFP-XIK (left column) or YFP-FABD2 (right column) were treated with 100 nM latrunculin B (LatB) during observation on the microscope (n=8 for YFP-XIK; n=10 for YFP-FABD2). DIC and fluorescence images were captured in 30 s intervals. YFP-XIK images were captured near the center of the root hair, whereas YFP-FABD2 images show the cortical actin filaments. Representative images from Movies S4 and S5 at the indicated times are shown. Size bar for A-C: 10 m.. (A) Prior to treatment, YFP-XIK accumulated near the tip and actin filaments formed many, primarily longitudinal bundles in the shank. Computational detection of actin filaments is shown below the fluorescence image. Note that this actin marker does not label the fine actin mesh in the apical region of the root hair.. (B) Within 1.5 min of LatB treatment, YFP-XIK intensity in the tip decreased while actin cables showed first signs of disorganization with the appearance of short filaments in the apical region. At this time, large vacuoles were seen to approach the tip (e.g. left DIC image).. (C) After 5 min of LatB treatment, YFP-XIK was largely absent from the tip and formed larger clusters in the subapical and shank regions. YFP-FABD2 cables were still present in the shank and also were present in the tip region of the root hair. These areas were separated by a region with no or few actin filaments and low fluorescence intensity.. (D) Kymograph of DIC images revealing growth of the root hair. Total height of the image represents 17 min (YFP-XIK) and 20 min (YFP-FABD2), respectively. Note that growth of the root hair stopped around 5 min after LatB application (arrow).. (E) Kymograph of fluorescence images. YFP-XIK fluorescence was strongest near the tip before LatB application (arrow) but then dropped quickly in the tip region. By contrast, YFP-FABD2 signal in the tip was low prior to treatment but increased in the presence of LatB. Curved white lines indicate position of the root hair tip.. (F) Quantitative analysis of YFP-XIK and YFP-FABD2 accumulation in the tip. Solid lines indicate fluorescence intensities of the two markers within the first 2 m of the root hair over time. Dashed line in right graph indicates the distance of the front-most actin filament from the tip (see lower panels in A-C). Vertical dotted line indicates start of LatB treatment during which root hair shifted and focus had to be reestablished.. . . . In parallel to the accumulation of actin in the tip region, we observed a loss of YFP-XIK signal in the same area (n=8; Figure 6, left column; Movie S4). This loss of YFP-XIK accumulation (Figure 6F) was accompanied by the appearance of vacuoles in the apical area (Figure 6B,C, DIC image), indicating a dramatic reorganization of the tip cytoplasm. During LatB treatment, YFP-XIK began to appear in several larger aggregates dispersed throughout the root hair (Figure 6C). These aggregates did not represent accumulations of cytosol since they did not coincide with the soluble mCherry marker (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicate that growing root hairs respond rapidly to moderate concentrations of LatB by reorganizing their actin cytoskeleton near the tip which is accompanied by a rapid loss of myosin XIK near the tip.. . . YFP-XIK partially colocalizes with several vesicle markers that accumulate at the tip of root hairs. The accumulation of YFP-XIK in the root hair tip could result from one of several mechanisms, among them the association with RabA4b vesicles that accumulate in the apical area [8]. In addition, the Rho/Rac-like small G-protein ROP2 has been recognized as an essential regulator of tip growth that accumulates both at the apical plasma membrane and on vesicles near the apex [50]. Similarly, YFP-RHD4 has been shown to accumulate at the tip of growing root hairs and rhd4-1 mutants showed stochastic YFP-RabA4b fluctuations [38]. Alternatively, the tip region is known to be rich in cytosol and YFP-XIK accumulation might simply reflect free diffusion into the accessible space in the tip. Thus, to gain additional insight into the mechanism of XIK accumulation at the tip and its likely cargo, we compared the distribution of YFP-XIK with several markers in root hairs of double transgenic plants.. Interestingly, accumulation of CFP-RabA4b and YFP-XIK overlapped partially within the apical dome but the peak of CFP-RabA4b accumulation occurred closer to the apex than that of YFP-XIK (Figure 7A). Quantitative analysis of signal distribution over time revealed a stable accumulation of the CFP-RabA4b maximum approximately 3 m ahead of YFP-XIK maximum (Table 1 and Figure S6). In addition, tip accumulation of YFP-XIK and CFP-RabA4b fluctuated independently (Movie S6), suggesting that the CFP-RabA4b labeled vesicles at the root hair apex were not associated with YFP-XIK. CFP-RHD4 was partially colocalized near the apex where YFP-XIK accumulated, however, CFP-RHD4 signal was weaker in the apical dome of the root hair tip, while YFP-XIK was highly accumulated in that area (Figure 7B). This was confirmed by a quantitative analysis of the position of maximal signal intensity in several root hair cells (Table 1 and Figure S6). A similar distribution in the cytoplasm was observed for mCherry-ROP2, except that this marker was also present at the apical plasma membrane (Figure 7C). Thus, YFP-XIK accumulation peaks closer to the apex than RHD4 or ROP2-containing vesicles. Finally, we established that YFP-XIK is not simply freely diffusing in the tip region by comparing it to a soluble cytosol marker, mCherry, and observing that their distributions in the tip did not match (Figure 7D). Specifically, we found that YFP-XIK accumulation peaked approximately 3 m ahead of the mCherry marker (Table 1 and Figure S6).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0076745.g007. Figure 7. . YFP-XIK partially colocalized with CFP-RabA4b and CFP-RHD4 at the tip of the growing root hairs.. First row of each panel shows YFP-XIK (green) localization in the root hairs while the second row presents other markers in the same root hairs (magenta). Merged images are shown in the third row. To compare localizations, pixel intensity along the root hair center (yellow dashed line in A) of each merged image was visualized in the fourth row. Signal intensities along the first 15 mum near the tip (white dashed line in B) are shown to emphasize the distribution of the two proteins near the tip of root hairs (fifth row). Scale bar indicates 10 mum.. (a) Partial colocalization of CFP-RabA4b and YFP-XIK. Although CFP-RabA4b and YFP-XIK localized at the tip of root hairs, CFP-RabA4b proteins accumulated closer to the apex while YFP-XIK signal was maximal in the subapex of the root hairs. Also compare Movie S6.. (b) Partial colocalization of CFP-RHD4 and YFP-XIK. CFP-RHD4 labeled vesicles accumulated further away from the root hair tip than YFP-XIK which resulted in partial overlap with the YFP-XIK signal.. (C) mCherry-ROP2 localization in cytosol and plasma membrane. Localization of YFP-XIK was clearly distinguishable from both inactive mCherry-ROP2 in the cytosol and active mCherry-ROP2 at the plasma membrane.. (D) Distribution of cytosolic mCherry was different from YFP-XIK localization at the root hair tip suggesting that accumulation of YFP-XIK at the tip did not reflect free diffusion.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0076745.t001.

The maxima are statistically different from each other except for the different YFP-XIK data and the CFP-RHD4 and mCherry comparison (Tukeys Multiple Comparison Test, p>0.05).. . . . . . ROP2 recruitment to the plasma membrane is impaired in xik root hairs. ROP GTPases are crucial regulators of tip growth that coordinate calcium and ROS signaling [5,51,52]. They are recruited to the plasma membrane (PM) in the tip of root hairs and pollen tubes although the inactive form of ROP proteins accumulates in the cytosol [53]. This general distribution was found in both wild type and xik root hairs expressing YFP-ROP2 or mCherry-ROP2 (Figure 8A), even though the signal at the PM of the mutant seemed slightly reduced. To quantify the recruitment of ROP2 to the PM, we developed an automated algorithm that determined the fluorescence signal at the tip relative to a segment of the cytosol (CS) immediately behind the apex (see Methods and Figure S3). The relative PM accumulation of ROP2 fluctuated slightly over time (Figure 8B) but the amplitude of these fluctuations was smaller (coefficient of variation about 2%) than seen for YFP-RabA4b (Figure 2C) and also did not show any periodicity as is typical for calcium concentrations [54]. Importantly, the PM recruitment was reduced in the xik mutant (0.93  0.04, SD, n = 27) compared to wild type (1.01  0.05, SD, n = 33; t-test, p<0.0001) (Figure 8C), suggesting that XIK might be involved in ROP-GTPase signaling required for tip growth but not for cell polarity.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0076745.g008.

(B) Quantification of ROP2 recruitment to the plasma membrane in growing root hairs.

(C) Average PM/CS ratio for root hairs from different genotypes. Every dot represents average PM/CS ratio of a single root hair over a 3 min period. Some of the Col-0 root hairs expressed YFP-ROP2 instead of mCherry-ROP2.. . . . We also tested whether expression of YFP-XIK restored normal targeting of mCherry-ROP2 to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the PM/CS ratio of mCherry-ROP2 did not change in the complemented mutants (Figure 8C; t-test between wild type and XIKpro:YFP-XIK xik, p<0.0001, while t-test between xik-3 and XIKpro:YFP-XIK xik, p= 0.9914), suggesting that the reduced relative abundance of the G-protein at the PM of mutant root hairs is not responsible for their slower growth. This conclusion is also supported by a lack of correlation between growth rates and PM/CS values for individual root hairs (data not shown)..
PMC3481204	ResultsOrgan-specific mRNA accumulation of AOC gene family membersTo inspect putative redundancy among the AOCs in terms of mRNA accumulation, transcript accumulation of all four genes was first analysed by qRT-PCR analysis in various organs and developmental stages of A. thaliana plants. Using primers specific for individual AOC-cDNAs, accumulation of transcripts of each of the four AOC genes was analysed in juvenile, adult, and old rosette leaves, stems, cauline leaves, flower buds, and open flowers, all from 10-week-old plants (Fig. 1A, 1B). Obviously, AOC1 and AOC2 expression was high in all leaves, whereas AOC3 and AOC4 were preferentially expressed in roots (Fig. 1C). This corresponds to in silico data (www.genevestigator.ethz.ch, Fig. 1D) with the exception that the expression of AOC1 and AOC2 cannot be detected individually by the ATH1 micro array as it lacks AOC1- and AOC2-specific probe sets. The AOC1-labelled probe set is ambiguous and putatively also detects other AOC transcripts, for example, AOC2. The transcript accumulation of all AOC genes in stems, flower buds, and open flowers is relatively low (Fig. 1A, inset, Fig. 1B), but a preferential accumulation of AOC4 mRNA and, to a lesser extent, of AOC1 mRNA in flowers points to a putative function of these AOCs in JA biosynthesis during flower development.Fig. 1. Organ-specific expression analysis of AOC gene family members. Analyses were performed with different organs of 10-week-old plants grown under long-day conditions (A, B) or with roots of 10-d-old seedlings grown under continuous light (C). (A-C) qRT-PCR analyses of AOC1-4 expression. AtPP2A (At1g13330) served as a constitutively expressed control gene. Data represent mean values and standard errors of three biological replicates. The inset in (A) shows a magnification of the expression in stems, buds, and flowers. Microarray data (D) of AOC expression in wild-type organs were taken from the gene atlas (www.genevestigator.ethz.ch) (# indicates ambiguous probe for AOC1, which may detect partially other AOCs). CEL, comparative expression level.AOC promoter activities during seedling developmentIn order to elucidate tissue-specific expression of all four AOC genes and to confirm transcript data from various plant organs, promoter activities of AOC1, AOC2, AOC3, and AOC4 were analysed during growth and development. The promoter region covering the region 1.4-2.0kb upstream of the ATG and the first exon of each AOC gene was used to transform A. thaliana Col-0 plants with the respective promoter::GUS constructs (see Materials and methods for details). At least 10 independent T1 lines were used to select three representative lines each, which were further cultivated to generate homozygous lines. Homozygous T3 transgenic seeds were inspected prior to imbibition and 1, 2, and 3 d after germination (dag) (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). Dry seeds were free of any AOC promoter activities, but AOC4 promoter activity was already detectable in the root tip at 1 dag, and increased during the following 2 d. Promoter activity of AOC1 appeared first at 2 dag in the cotyledons followed by AOC2 promoter activity at 3 dag, whereas initial AOC3 promoter activity was detectable in the hypocotyl and less in meristematic cells of the root tip at 3 dag. AOC4 promoter activity appeared strongly in meristematic cells of the root tip, in the root cap, and less in the hypocotyl of seedlings at 3 dag.In 1-week-old seedlings, most of the promoter activity patterns of seedlings at 3 dag were maintained, but at a higher level and were extended to the apical meristem in the case of AOC1 and AOC3 (Fig. 2). Highly localized promoter activities appeared for AOC3 and AOC4 in the root tip. The AOC3 promoter was active only in meristematic cells of the root tip, whereas AOC4 promoter activity was also visible in the root cap. Both promoters were active at the site of lateral root formation. In 2-week-old plants, strong promoter activities of AOC1 and AOC2 and weaker activity of the AOC3 promoter throughout all leaves was found, whereas the AOC4 promoter was highly active in the main vein of all leaves (Fig. 3A). Promoter activity patterns of AOC3 and AOC4 in the primary roots as well as the sites of lateral root out growth were largely consistent with those of 1-week-old plants, but intensities were stronger. In the case of AOC3, a shift of the localized promoter activity was observed in meristematic cells of 1-week-old primary roots (Fig. 2) into the elongation zone of 2-week-old primary roots (Fig. 3D), whereas AOC4 promoter activity was expanded to the central cylinder of the root elongation zone.Fig. 2. Promoter activities of AOC gene family members in 1-week-old seedlings of the respective GUS-reporter lines non-treated or treated with 10 M JAME (JM), and magnified views of primary root tips and lateral root tips. Bars represent 50 m.Fig. 3.

(E) Top view and (F) cross-sections of rosette leaves. Bars represent 50 m (B-D) and 100 m (F).Promoter activities in fully developed plantsIn 1-month-old plants promoters of AOC1, AOC2, and AOC3 were active in rosette leaves throughout the leaf area with slightly higher activity in vascular tissue, whereas the AOC4 promoter activity was restricted to the major vein and first order minor veins, but did not appear in the veins where phloem loading takes place (Fig. 3E). Inspection of cross-sections confirmed this pattern and showed promoter activity for AOC1 and AOC2 in the epidermal layer as well (Fig. 3F). The specific AOC4 promoter activity in vascular bundles observed in the leaf overview was also confirmed by cross-sections (Fig. 3F). In roots, the following activity patterns appeared: the AOC4 promoter was preferentially active in the root tip of primary and secondary roots and in lateral root primordia, and the promoters of AOC3 and AOC4 were both active in the ramifications of primary and secondary roots (not shown). The promoter activity of the above-ground parts of 1-month-old plants persisted in 2-month-old plants, where AOC1, AOC2, and AOC3 promoters were active. The AOC4 promoter was also active in most cauline leaves and young leaves, but less active in senescent leaves and stems (see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online).Promoter activities in flowers and during embryo and seed developmentYoung flower buds exhibited strong activity of the AOC1 promoter in sepals and petals, whereas very weak activity was observed for AOC2, AOC3, and AOC4 in sepals (data not shown). Open flowers exhibited high activity of AOC1 and AOC4 promoters in sepals, petals, the transmission tissue of the pistil and in filaments of stamens (Fig. 4A, 4C, 4D). For AOC2 and AOC3, only weak promoter activities were detected in sepals and for AOC3 in the stigma. Detailed inspection of mature pollen and anthers revealed high activity of the AOC1 promoter in anthers and released pollen, weak activity of the AOC4 promoter in some pollen grains, and no promoter activity of AOC2 and AOC3 in anthers and released pollen (Fig. 4D, 4E). The GUS activity detected for the AOC4 promoter in the flower stalk was confirmed by in situ hybridization with gene-specific probes (Fig. 4B). Expression of AOC1, AOC2, and AOC3 could not be detected by in situ hybridizations in the flower stalk, thus corresponding to the lack of GUS activity. The promoter activity data in general correspond well with the in silico expression data for (AOC1), AOC3, and AOC4 obtained from Genevestigator database (https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/;. Zimmermann et al., 2005).Fig. 4. Promoter activities of AOC gene family members in open flowers of two-month-old plants of the respective GUS-reporter lines. (A) Whole flower. (B) In situ hybridization with gene-specific probes in cross-sections of the flower stalk. (C) Stigma. (D) Anthers. (E) Pollen. Bars represent 50 m (B). Arrows in (A) indicate the region used for cross-sections shown in (B).Inspection of embryo development did not reveal promoter activity of any AOC gene family member in fertilized ovules or during various stages of embryo development (see Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). These data correspond to undetectable AOC promoter activities in mature seeds in fully developed siliques (see Supplementary Figs. S3E and S1 at JXB online). Strong activities, however, of AOC3 and AOC4 promoters were detected in the valves and the abscission zones of siliques.Organ- and tissue-specific expression of the AOC gene family members upon JA treatmentSince AOC transcript accumulation in leaves has been shown to increase after JA treatment (Stenzel et al., 2003b), it was analysed whether JA treatment alters organ- and tissue-specific promoter activities of AOC1, AOC2, AOC3, and AOC4. The corresponding transgenic lines were grown for 7 d on agar plates and were kept untreated (control) or were treated with 50nM, 10 M, and 100 M JAME for 16h. Compared with the GUS activity of the non-treated plants, the general patterns of AOC promoter activities were not altered by any JAME concentration, but an elevated GUS activity could be seen for each line and each tissue as shown for 10 M JAME and the main root tip as well as the lateral root (Fig. 2). This increase in activity was also reflected in mRNA accumulation data published for total AOC mRNA and AOC1-AOC4 mRNA (Stenzel et al., 2003b. ). The only exception was an additional AOC4 promoter activity in the primary root stele near lateral root branching as well as in the elongating lateral roots. The induction of AOC gene expression by JAME was also confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis of the leaves and roots, respectively. In 10-d-old seedlings the expression of all four AOCs was increased by application of 10 M JAME (see Supplementary Fig. S4B, D at JXB online). Similar results were obtained in response to the local wounding of leaves or roots of the respective plant material (see Supplementary Fig. S4A, C at JXB online). The transcriptional induction was stronger in leaves with AOC1 and AOC2 being highly expressed. In roots, predominant expression of AOC3 and AOC4 was confirmed. However, the presence of an inducing stimulus, such as treatment with JAME and local wounding, also triggered the expression of AOC1 and AOC2 in roots which further corroborates the hypothesis of functional redundancies among the AOC gene family members. This suggests that promoter activities of the AOC gene family members are regulated mainly developmentally but can be increased by inducing signals such as JA.Loss-of-function mutants suggest functional redundancy of AOCs in JA biosynthesisT-DNA loss-of-function mutants with compromised expression of the respective AOCs (see Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online) were analysed to assess functional redundancy of Arabidopsis AOCs in planta. aoc1, aoc3, and aoc4 single mutants did not show phenotypic alterations in JA-related phenotypes such as root growth, lateral root development, flower development, and fertility (see Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online). In response to mechanical wounding, aoc1 and aoc4 single mutants showed slight yet significantly reduced OPDA levels 1.5h post wounding. However, the lack of an additive effect in the aoc1aoc4 double mutant delimits the biological significance of these results. Unfortunately, no AOC2 T-DNA-insertion line was available to study the effects of AOC2 loss in vivo and the tandem repeat organization of AOC1, AOC2, and AOC3 prevented the generation of higher order mutants that combine aoc1 and aoc3. The available double mutants aoc1aoc4 and aoc3aoc4 also lacked JA-related phenotypes. Remarkably, even tissues that showed a certain degree of specificity in the promoter::GUS analyses (e.g. AOC1 and AOC4 in anthers, Fig. 4) failed to show developmental defects associated with JA-deficiency (e.g. male sterility) in the respective double mutants (see Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online). In conclusion, these analyses indicate a generally high level of functional redundancy among the four Arabidopsis AOCs.Homo- and heteromerization of the four AOCs in vivo. Enzymatically active AOC2 is known to form a trimer in vitro (Hofmann et al., 2006). Therefore, heteromerization of the AOC proteins might be another level of regulation in JA biosynthesis since the spatial and temporal pattern of promoter activities of the four AOCs exhibited partially redundant properties.In order to inspect putative homomeric and heteromeric interactions of the different AOCs in vivo, BiFC analyses were performed using mesophyll protoplasts of A. thaliana transiently transformed with pairwise combinations of fusions of AOC1-4 with the N- or C-terminal half of YFP, respectively (Fig. 5). As visible by YFP fluorescence, all combinations of AOCs (homomeric as well as heteromeric) are able to reconstitute YFP, but with different appearance and intensities. As depicted for the combination AOC4-YFPN/AOC4-YFPC (Fig. 5A), strong fluorescence signals appeared as dots in chloroplasts indicating homomerization of AOC4. Other homomeric combinations showed a more diffuse signal within the chloroplasts, such as AOC3-YFPN/AOC3-YFPC. Analogous differences in the appearance of YFP fluorescence were also visible in heteromeric interactions. Although all of them showed fluorescence signals in chloroplasts, they appeared as dots (e.g. AOC4-YFPN/AOC1-YFPC) or partially diffuse signals (e.g. AOC3-YFPN/AOC1-YFPC). Using the calculation of relative fluorescence intensities, the homomeric interaction of AOC4 was highest compared with that of AOC1, AOC2, and AOC3 (Fig. 5B). The heteromeric interactions of AOC1, 2, and 3 were strongest with AOC4 independently of the type of combination, whereas combinations with AOC1 always exhibited the lowest intensities (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5. Summary on BiFC analysis of AOCs in mesophyll protoplasts of A. thaliana. AOC1, 2, 3, and 4 were fused with either the N-terminal or the C-terminal half of YFP and pairwise expressed in mesophyll protoplasts. (A) YFP fluorescence recorded by LSM using a lambda scan, (B) relative fluorescence intensities for all interactions shown in (A). Mean and standard deviations (n 30) is shown. Different letters designate statistically different values (one-way ANOVA with Tukeys HSD test; P 0.05). Bar represents 5 m for all micrographs in (A). Note that the level of red chlorophyll fluorescence depends on the presence of YFP due to the use of an excitation wave length of 514nm followed by a lambda scan.False-positive signals may occur in isolated protoplasts due to the protoplast isolation procedure and/or by the endogenously occurring AOC protein which is known to be abundant in fully developed leaves of A. thaliana (Stenzel et al., 2003b. ). Therefore, the data were verified by transient transformation of N. benthamiana leaves. The N. benthamiana AOC is encoded by a single gene, and the protein localization is confined to vascular bundles as shown in Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online. Thus, the use of N. benthamiana mesophyll protoplast circumvents putative artefacts caused by interactions of the heterologous expressed AOCs with an endogenous, untagged AOC. Data obtained using the N. benthamiana system verified the results recorded with mesophyll protoplasts of A. thaliana (see Supplementary Fig. S7 at JXB online)A final question is whether the heteromeric interaction among the AOC proteins affects AOC activity. Differential activities could result in different capacities of JA formation which, in turn, would result in differences in the expression of JA-responsive genes. Advantage was taken of the well-known positive feed-back loop in JA biosynthesis, where an increased JA level leads to an increase in AOC expression (Wasternack, 2007). Two pairs of AOCs exhibiting either weak (AOC1-YFPN/AOC2-YFPC) or strong (AOC3-YFPN/AOC4-YFPC) interaction in both transformation systems were selected and expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. In both cases, YFP fluorescence was clearly visible confirming an appropriate expression level of the transgenes. Transcript accumulation of the internal NbAOC was recorded by qRT-PCR as a read-out of wound-induced JA formation in the respective transgenic tissues (Fig. 6). Compared with the empty vector control, there was a clear increase in NbAOC transcript accumulation by the transient transformation of constructs expressing individual Arabidopsis AOCs. However, upon heterologous expression of the two selected interaction pairs, NbAOC transcript accumulation was not changed significantly when compared with the expression of the individual Arabidopsis AOCs. Moreover, no correlation was visible depending on the strength of heteromeric interaction. This suggests that heterologous over-expression of Arabidopsis AOCs in N. benthamiana can be attributed to elevated JA levels leading to increased NbAOC transcript accumulation. Heteromerization of two distinct AOC pairs apparently did not alter the capacity of JA formation on a broad scale, yet a putative in vivo function might be masked by the over-expression in the heterologous system.Fig. 6. Wound-induced transcript accumulation of NbAOC in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana transiently transformed with various AOC constructs. AOC1, 2, 3, and 4 were fused with either the N-terminal or the C-terminal half of YFP and transiently expressed in leaves of N. benthamiana either alone or in two combinations (AOC1+AOC2 or AOC3+AOC4). Five days after infiltration, leaves were taken directly or wounded for 1h and the expression of the endogenous NbAOC was recorded by qRT-PCR using NtRPS6 as the constitutively expressed control. The mean of fold change SD (n=5) of wound-induced induction of NbAOC expression is shown. Different letters designate statistically different values (one-way ANOVA with Tukeys HSD test; P 0.05)..
PMC3485258	Results. . Members of the NF-YA family are strongly up-regulated by different abiotic stresses. It has been shown that some members of the NF-YA family are up-regulated in Pi-deprived plants [16], [27] and analysis of public microarray databases suggests that they are also deregulated by other abiotic stresses, including low nitrogen (N), drought, cold, heat, high glucose and by treatment with the stress-related hormone ABA (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/plant.jsp). These data indicate that the members of the NF-YA family might play a general role in stress responses.. In the past years our lab has focused on the study of plant responses to nutrient stress, specifically to Pi availability. Therefore, we explore the behavior of several of these NF-YA members in response to diverse nutrient stresses. As a starting point we performed a time-course qRT-PCR analysis of the changes in transcript levels of five members of the NF-YA family (NF-YA2, 3, 5, 7, 10), which were up-regulated in our microarray analysis of the Arabidopsis response to low Pi availability [20]. Besides low Pi (5 M), we also analyzed its response to low N (50 M), high salinity (100 mM NaCl) and high sucrose (Suc) (9.4%). Transcript levels for these NF-YA family members increased between 5 and 50-fold, under all conditions tested, with the exception of high salinity, where only NF-YA5 and NF-YA3 transcript levels increased by 2-fold at 4 and 14 days of treatment, respectively (Figure 1). An increase in NF-YA2, NF-YA7 and NF-YA10 transcript levels was detected 4 days after germination (dag) in low P, low N and high Suc treatments, NF-YA5 and NF-YA3 showed a similar response in high Suc but no change in low N and P conditions, respectively (Figure 1). Transcript levels were maintained 8 dag and showed a further increase at 14 dag for low P and low N. In high Suc, the level of transcript induction was similar at 8 and 14 dag. This experiment also showed that even though all 5 NF-YAs tested were up-regulated in response to low P, low N and high Suc conditions, the degree of responsiveness of each NF-YA gene to each condition differed, for example, under low N NF-YA3 was the most responsive (19-fold induction at 14dag), whereas NF-YA5 was most responsive in high Suc (43-fold induction at 14dag) and NF-YA10 under low P (51-fold induction at 14 dag).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g001. Figure 1. . Expression profile of Arabidopsis NF-YA genes in seedlings exposed to different stress conditions.. Seedlings were germinated in solid media for each treatment (100 mM NaCl, low N, 9.4% Sucrose or low P). Total RNA was extracted after 4, 8 and 14 days of treatment and transcript levels for NF-YA2, 3, 7, 5 and 10 determined by qRT-PCR. Expression level of ACTIN 2 (ACT2) was used as internal reference. Values represent the means and error bars indicate the standard error (SE) of 3 independent amplification replicates.. . . . Since the expression of several members of the Arabidopsis miR169 family is repressed by low Pi and low N [15], and NF-YA5 is a target for this microRNA family [14], it was important to determine whether the expression of the miR169 family is altered by the same nutrient stress conditions under which NF-YAs mRNA levels increased. For this, we used a qRT-PCR approach similar to that previously described [15] to examine the mature forms of miR169ag and miR169hn. A more specific analysis was not possible because of the high identity between the mature miR169 sequences. A substantial decrease in the level of the mature miR169ag and miR169hn subgroups was observed in seedlings exposed to low N, low P and high Suc (Figure 2). Reduction in miR169 expression was more pronounced after 14 days of treatment, correlating with the increase in NF-YA transcript levels in response to the same treatments. Despite no clear change in expression level was observed for the miR169 subgroups under high salinity conditions, we cannot exclude the possibility that one or few specific members of the miR169 family could be controlling the low but consistent increase in transcript levels detected for NF-YA3 and NF-YA5 at 4 and 14 dag (Figure 1). This fact could be due to, the qRT-PCR analysis we used to assess miR169 levels is only able to detect subgroups of several mature miR169s but does not have specificity to detect subtle changes in the expression of a single member of the miR169 family.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g002. Figure 2. . Expression profile of mature miR169 Arabidopsis in seedlings exposed to different stress conditions.. Seedlings were germinated in solid media for each treatment (100 mM NaCl, low N, 9.4% Sucrose or low P). Total RNA was extracted after 4, 8 and 14 days of treatment and transcript levels for miR169 determined by qRT-PCR. Because of high sequence identity quantification was made for two groups of miR169, a to g and h to n. Expression level of ACT2 was used as internal reference. Values represents the means and error bars indicate SE of 3 independent amplification replicates.. . . . Changes in NF-YA mRNA levels and miRNA169 abundance fit well with the classical behavior of miRNAs and their targets showing an inverse pattern of expression in which the NF-YA transcript level increases as the corresponding miR169 decreases.. . . The induction response of NF-YAs under Low Pi conditions has both a transcriptional and a post-transcriptional component. If the inverse expression patterns of miR169s and its NF-YA targets are integrated into stress response regulatory networks, and this obeys a post-transcriptional regulatory program, it would be expected that in mutants affected in microRNA biogenesis, the expression of the NF-YAs should be altered. To explore this possibility, we analyzed NF-YA transcript levels in hen 1-1 grown under contrasting Pi conditions. Since HEN1 is involved in transferring a methyl group to the 3 end of miRNAs that confers stability to the mature miRNA [28], we expect that, in the mutant, the amount of mature miR169 is reduced leading to an increase in the uncleaved NF-YA mRNAs. Northern Blot analysis showed that the level of miR169 decreases in WT seedlings subjected to Pi-deprivation for 8 and 14 days, whereas in hen1-1 the level of mature miR169 was undetectable in both high and low Pi media (Figure 3A). qRT-PCR was performed to determine the effect of hen1-1 on NF-YA transcript levels in media containing sufficient and low Pi. As previously shown for WT seedlings, transcript levels for NF-YA2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 were higher in Pi-deprived seedlings than in those grown in Pi-sufficient conditions (Table 1). In 8-day-old hen1-1 seedlings grown in Pi sufficient conditions, NF-YA5, NF-YA3, NF-YA2 and NF-YA10 transcript levels were 9-, 5.4-, 15.7- and 5.3-fold higher than those present in WT seedlings, respectively, confirming NF-YA post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs and suggesting that NF-YA2 is the most tightly post-transcriptionally regulated member of the tested NF-YAs (Table 1). In contrast, transcript levels for NF-YA7, which lacks the binding site for miR169, was similar in hen1-1 to that present in WT seedlings (Table 1). In 8-day-old hen1-1 seedlings grown in low Pi media a further increase in transcript levels was observed for NF-YA3 and NF-YA10 in comparison to hen1-1 seedlings grown in Pi-sufficient conditions (Table 1), suggesting that these genes are also subjected to transcriptional regulation. In the case of NF-YA2, transcript levels were similar in Pi-deprived and Pi-sufficient seedlings suggesting regulation mainly at the post-transcriptional level.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g003.

Similar results were obtained for 14-day-old seedlings for NF-YA2 and 10, and for NF-YA3 and 5 for which transcript levels seem to be mainly regulated post-transcriptionally. To confirm that the effect HEN1 loss of function on NF-YA transcript levels was due to a direct effect on microRNA biogenesis and not an indirect general effect on Pi-deprivation responses, we examined the expression of SPX1, a Pi-responsive gene [27]. It was found that SPX1 transcript levels in the WT and hen1-1 were similar in both Pi-sufficient and limiting conditions, showing that hen1-1 does not have a general effect on the Arabidopsis response to Pi-availability (Table 1).. To corroborate that NF-YA2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 are also regulated at the transcriptional level by Pi-availability we fused the promoter region of these genes to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. In Pi-sufficient conditions, a similar expression pattern to that previously reported for PNF-YAs:GUS. [12] was observed. In contrast, in Pi-deprived seedlings a significant increase of GUS activity was observed for PNF-YA2, 3, 7 and 10 lines with different patterns of tissue specific responses (Figure 3B and Figure S1A to S1D). We also produced promoter:GUS transcriptional gene fusions for some of the miR169 family members, namely miR169i/j, miR169k/l, miR169m/n, which are arranged in tandem, and for miR169h and miR169a which are monocistronic units. In seedlings grown in Pi-sufficient media we observed a pattern of expression similar to that previously reported [29], with predominant expression in the vascular tissue. Under Pi-limiting conditions it was observed that GUS staining decreased for miR169 promoters, in particular for miR169h, miR169k/l, and miR169i/j as compared to that observed for seedlings grown in Pi-sufficient media (Figure 3C and Figure S1E to S1H). There is a clear overlap between the expression patterns of PNF-YA2:GUS, PNF-YA5:GUS and PNF-YA10:GUS with PmiR169h:GUS, PmiR169i/j:GUS and PmiR169k/l:GUS in vascular tissues of leaf and hypocotyl; showing a space-time coincidence between the miRNAs and their targets suggesting that, under Pi limiting conditions, the decrease in the transcript levels of these miR169s is, at least in part, responsible for the increase in transcript levels of NF-YA2, NFYA5 and NF-YA10.. To confirm that miR169 modulates the level of NF-YA2, 3, 5, and 10 mRNAs, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis lines that overexpress the mature sequence of miR169 h to n, which is identical for all these miRNAs. For this we cloned a fragment of DNA that encodes for miR169m and miR169n precursors arranged in tandem, hereafter called miR169nm, under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter.. Two homozygous overexpressor lines were characterized by qRT-PCR, one showed a 2-fold and the other a 3.5-fold higher level of mature miR169hn when compared to WT plants (Figure S2A). qRT-PCR analysis showed that transcript levels of NF-YA2, 3, 5 and 10 were reduced in both miR169/OE lines, whereas transcript levels for NF-YA7, which lacks the target site for miR169, were unaffected by the overexpression of miR169 (Figure S2B).. Taken together, these results confirm that the post-transcriptional regulation of several members of the NF-YA family is mediated by miR169hn, which in turn are transcriptionally regulated by Pi availability.. . . NF-YA overexpression causes a dwarf phenotype. To characterize the functional role of NF-YAs, we produced transgenic plants that express miR169-resistant versions of NF-YA2, 3 and 10 genes and the native form of the NF-YA7 gene, under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. At least 5 independent overexpressing lines were generated for each construct. After an initial phenotypic evaluation (Figure 4) and qRT-PCR analysis of two representative lines (Figure S3), one OE line for each construct was selected for further detailed evaluation. qRT-PCR analysis showed that these transgenic lines had from 20- up to 1000-fold higher transcript levels than that of the corresponding NF-YA in WT plants (Figure S3). No NF-YA5 OE lines were produced since the effect of its overexpression in Arabidopsis was previously reported [13]. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g004. Figure 4. . Phenotype of transgenic lines overexpressing NF-YAs and miR169nm.. (A) and (C) Phenotype of 14-day-old seedlings overexpressing NF-YAs and miR169nm, respectively. (B) Phenotype of three-week-old plants grown under greenhouse conditions. Bars=10 mm in (A) to (C).. . . . Phenotypic analyses of the selected NF-YA OE lines showed that P35S:NF-YA3 plants developed in a similar fashion to WT controls, whereas P35S:NF-YA2, P35S:NF-YA7 and P35S:NF-YA10 plants showed a dwarf phenotype depending on the expression level of the transgene (Figure 4A and Figure S3). The dwarf phenotype of P35S:NF-YA2, 7 and 10 lines was observed both at the seedling and adult stages (Figure 4B), smaller siliques and seeds were also observed in these OE lines compared to those of the WT (Figure S4). The dwarf phenotype observed in NF-YA OE lines was reflected in biomass reduction, for example P35S:NF-YA2 plants had almost 2.5-fold less biomass than the WT (Figure S5). A dark green color was observed in P35S:NF-YA2, 7, and 10 leaves and to a lesser extent in leaves of P35S:NF-YA3 plants, which correlated with a higher chlorophyll content in these lines as compared to that of WT plants (Figure S6). P35S:miR169nm plants had a contrasting phenotype to that observed for NF-YA OE lines, as they produced 20% larger seeds, accumulated approximately 25% more biomass and less chlorophyll than WT plants (Figure 4B to 4C, Figure S4, Figure S5, and Figure S6). The relatively mild phenotype observed for the miR169 overexpressing lines could be explained by the fact that repression of NF-YAs containing the miR169 target sequences is incomplete and/or because the expression of NF-YA7 is not affected.. . . Transcriptomic analysis of genes downstream of NF-YA2, 3, 7, and 10. To identify genes regulated by NF-YAs while avoiding the potential indirect effects in gene expression related to the dwarf phenotype caused by constitutive NF-YA expression, we used the XVE inducible system (LexA-VP16-estrogen receptor) [30], [31] to drive the expression of miR169-resistant forms of NF-YA2, 3, 10 and the native form of NF-YA7 or the genomic region comprising the mir169nm. Representative transgenic lines containing these gene constructs showed WT phenotype when germinated in media lacking estradiol, whereas in estradiol-containing media, their phenotypes were similar to those observed in their constitutively expressed counterparts (data not shown). Estradiol-inducible NF-YA and miRNA169 overexpressing lines were used to analyze the effect of NF-YAs and miR169 overexpression on global RNA profiles.. The microarray data corresponding to the overexpression of NF-YAs showed a strikingly small overlap between up-regulated genes (Figure 5A), with only 4 genes shared by the four transgenic lines. Interestingly, down-regulated genes showed a greater overlap with 121 genes common to all lines (Figure 5B). In contrast to the results obtained for PXVE:NF-YA lines, our data from the PXVE:miR169nm array showed that 270 of the 359 differentially expressed genes were induced, including 32 genes that are down-regulated in the four PXVE:NF-YAs lines (Dataset S1). These results suggest that NF-YA overexpression has a mainly negative effect on gene expression and that this repressor activity is modulated by miR169.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g005.

Green indicates down-regulated values, red, up-regulated values and black unchanged values.. . . . To gain insight into the co-regulatory network downstream of NF-YAs, differentially expressed genes in NF-YA overexpressing lines were clustered using the Pearson correlation and average linkage clustering. This analysis confirmed that the expression profiles of PXVE:NF-YA lines were similar and inverse to those observed for the PXVE:miR169nm line (Figure 5C, Dataset S2). Analysis of the microarray data of PXVE:NF-YA lines using the web-tool Superviewer [32], showed that the expression of stress-related genes is modulated by the NF-Y/miR169 system, since these genes were down-regulated as a consequence of NF-YA overexpression and induced in the PXVE:miR169nm line (Figure 6). Using the MapMan functional category classification we found that differentially expressed genes in NF-YA overexpressing lines include genes whose function is related to carbon metabolism, starch breakdown, glycolysis, cell wall biosynthesis, senescence, fermentation, ABA and auxin sensing, circadian clock, among others, were repressed in NF-YA OE lines (Figure S7 and Dataset S3). Moreover, using the web-tool Genesect at VirtualPlant (http://virtualplant.bio.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/vpweb/), we determined that the set of general stress-induced genes [33], [34] have a significant overlap with genes repressed in PXVE:NF-YA lines (Table 2).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g006.

Significant differences (p-value<0.001) based on a Z-score overrepresented (Z-score>11) are highlighted in bold.. . . . . . NF-YA expression impairs cell elongation and has a strong impact on carbon metabolism. In coincidence with the dwarf phenotype of the NF-YA OE lines, we found that among the differentially expressed genes in PXVE:NF-YA lines, a number of genes strongly down-regulated encode for enzymes involved in cell wall modification processes such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylase-hydrolases (XTHs) and expansins (EXPs), suggesting that the dwarf phenotype observed in these lines could be due to defects in cell elongation (Table S1). To determine whether cell elongation was impaired in P35S:NF-YA lines, we measured hypocotyl elongation in etiolated P35S:NF-YA seedlings. These lines showed an important decrease in elongation capacity in this assay; P35S:NF-YA2, 3, 7 and 10 seedlings had a 49, 33, 41 and 39%, reduction in hypocotyl elongation as compared to that achieved by WT plants (Figure S8A to S8B).. In PXVE:NF-YA seedlings we also identified several differentially expressed genes involved in carbon metabolism, such as sucrose synthases (SUS1 and SUS4), qua-quine starch (QQS), beta-amylase 3 (BAM3) and alpha-AMYLASE 2. Interestingly, P35S:NF-YA lines treated with 9.4% Suc showed a Suc-hypersensitive phenotype, showing limited cotyledon expansion and being unable to develop true leaves as compared to the WT (Figure 7A to 7C). Moreover, we found that P35S:NF-YA2 plants had a 2-fold higher Suc content than WT whereas miR169/OE lines showed a 20% reduction (Table S2). P35S:NF-YA lines also had a higher starch content than WT plants, whereas the P35S:miR169nm line showed lower starch accumulation (Figure S9). Together these results suggest that NF-YAs can modulate plant growth (i.e. cell expansion) through the regulation of carbon metabolism related genes.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g007. Figure 7. .

P35S:NF-YA lines have an abiotic stress tolerance phenotype related to altered ABA perception and senescence. Our microarray data also showed that the expression of genes involved in ABA perception was strongly affected in all PXVE:NF-YA lines (Table 3). Since the crosstalk between sugar and ABA signaling has been well documented [36], we tested whether NF-YA overexpression also alters ABA sensitivity. Seedlings of P35S:NF-YA lines grown on plates with 1 M ABA showed hypersensitivity to this hormone, while the P35S:miR169nm line was slightly less sensitive than the WT (Figure 7A and 7C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.t003.

A direct link between ABA and abiotic stress responses has been reported, i.e., transgenic plants hypersensitive to ABA are tolerant to drought stress [37]. According to our microarray data, NF-YA overexpression down-regulates the expression of the general stress response genes, including most of the 48 genes of the anaerobic cluster [38] (Table S3). These findings prompted us to evaluate the response of P35S:NF-YA lines to abiotic stress conditions, namely flooding, drought, heat and cold. P35S:NF-YA lines showed higher tolerance to submergence when compared to WT plants, in which leaves showed the typical yellowing characteristic of the senescence induced by hypoxia (Figure 8A, 8C to 8F); P35S:miR169nm plants behaved similar to WT (Figure 8B). We also observed that stress-induced damage by drought (Figure S10A and S10B), heat and cold (Figure S11A and S11B) was significantly less severe in P35S:NF-YA seedlings than in WT and P35S:miR169nm seedlings.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g008. Figure 8. . NF-YA overexpression produces a flooding tolerant phenotype..

Inset in (F) is a magnification of P35S:NF-YA2 rosette. Two-week-old plants of each transgenic line were completely submerged in water-filled tanks in standard light/dark cycle (16/8) for 5 days and photographed after a recovery period of 14 days. The depth of the water column during submergence was kept at 6 cm above the pot surface.. . . . Several senescence-related genes, including SENESCENCE 1 (SEN1), POLYUBIQUITIN 10 (UBQ10), SALT TOLERANT ZINC FINGER (STZ) and WRKY6 are repressed in P35S:NF-YA plants (Table 4), suggesting that the increased expression of NF-YAs could lead to reduced senescence in Arabidopsis. We confirmed the role of NF-YA TFs in controlling senescence using an assay based on nitrogen starvation-induced senescence [39]. After two weeks of N starvation, WT plants showed clear senescence symptoms such as leaf yellowing, particularly in cotyledons. Leaf senescence was less drastic in P35S:NF-YA2, 3, 7 and 10 seedlings than that observed for the WT. In contrast, leaf senescence was more drastic in P35S:miR169nm seedlings than for the WT (Figure 9A). Chlorophyll content analysis confirmed the observed phenotypes under N starvation conditions, as chlorophyll content in WT seedlings was reduced 40%, whereas that of P35S:NF-YA lines decreased only 20 to 30% and in P35S:miR169nm seedlings reduction was about 60% (Figure 9B). Similar results were obtained using another senescence assay, by transferring plants to darkness for 7 days (Figure S12). Under greenhouse conditions, a delay between one to three weeks in developmental senescence was also observed for NF-YA overexpressing plants, as compared to the WT at the end of their life cycle (Figure S13A to S13L).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g009.

NF-YAs are part of an acclimatization strategy to cope with adverse conditions. Although there is substantial evidence indicating that growth reduction is part of an adaptive strategy in plants to face abiotic stresses [40], it is also possible that a dwarf phenotype per se promotes tolerance to abiotic stresses because smaller plants have lower water and nutrient requirements. To assess whether the stress tolerance phenotype observed in P35S:NF-YA is a direct effect of NF-YA overexpression per se or indirectly by reducing plant growth, we carried out freezing and heat assays using WT, P35S:NF-YA2 and PXVE:NF-YA2 lines. Seeds from these three lines were germinated in MS media and 8 dag the seedlings were transferred to MS supplemented with 7 M beta-estradiol for short (24 h) and long (7 days) induction times prior to exposure to freezing and heat stress. The idea is that if overexpression of NF-YAs per se is sufficient to confer tolerance, a short induction time should be enough, whereas if growth reduction is responsible for tolerance, a longer induction time will be needed.. At the short induction time, freezing and heat conditions imposed a similar stress on PXVE:NF-YA2 and WT seedlings, (Figure 10A to 10D). After 7 days of induction, when PXVE:NF-YA2 seedlings show a decrease in growth rate, seedlings showed a better survival to heat and freezing stress compared to WT. The reduction in growth rate was determined by monitoring the repression of EXL (Figure S14A and S14B), a gene involved in growth promotion process [41]. A control line constitutively overexpressing NF-YA2 (P35S:NF-YA2) performed significantly better than the WT at both short and long exposure times (Figure 10E).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0048138.g010.

(A) Images of eight-day-old WT, P35S:NF-YA2 and PXVE:NF-YA2 seedlings grown on 0.1 MS that were transferred to 0.1 MS+ beta-estradiol (7 M) for 24 h or 7 days prior to stress. Photographs were taken after four and seven days of recovery time for freezing (-7C/4 h, lids off) and heat (45C/2 h, lids on) treatments, respectively. (B) Weight of 12 seedlings of each line was determined at the indicated induction times. Data represent means and SD of three replicates statistically treated using a student t-test (*P<0.05). (C) Average survival rate of each plant line subsequent to the stress assay (n>50). Data represent means and SD of three replicates statistically treated using a student t-test (*P<0.05).. . . . . . Promoters of down-regulated genes in NF-YA overexpressing lines are enriched in DNA motifs related to stress responses. Since induced ectopic expression of the NF-YAs caused changes in the expression of a large number of genes, we searched, using the Athena Web tools [42], for enriched cis-regulatory elements in the promoters of the differentially expressed genes in each line. No clear motif enrichment was detected in up-regulated genes, whereas in down-regulated genes a number of enriched motifs was found, including ABA signaling-related (ABF binding site motif, ABRE binding site motif, ACGT ABRE motif A2OSE), dehydration responses (ABRE-like binding site motif, MYB1AT), drought stress responses (AtMYC2BS in RD22), unfolded protein response (UPRMOTIFIAT), WRKY transcription factor binding sites (W-box), TFIID binding site (TATA-box motif) and motifs related to circadian rhythm (Table S4). Intriguingly, no enrichment of the CCAAT motif in the promoter of differentially expressed genes in NF-YA OE lines was observed using either the Athena or the Promomer DNA motif searching tools [43] (Table S5). Therefore, it is unlikely that the complete NF-YA/NF-YB/NF-YC complex, which recognizes the CCAAT-box, regulates the expression of genes that are repressed in NF-YA OE lines.. . . Transcriptional activities of NF-YAs. Down-regulation of stress related genes in NF-YA overexpressing lines could be due to the NF-YA dependent activation of one or several transcriptional repressors or to a direct repressor activity of NF-YAs. In an attempt to elucidate whether NF-YAs act as positive and/or negative regulators of gene expression we used the CRES-T system (Chimeric repressor silencing technology) [44], [45] to convert NF-YA2 into a repressor. We reasoned that if NF-YAs indirectly down-regulated gene expression by activating the expression of one or several transcriptional repressors, conversion of NF-YAs into a repressor would result in the opposite effect (transcriptional activation of the same set of genes in the absence of the repressor(s)). If NF-YAs have a direct negative effect on gene expression, conversion of NF-YAs into repressors should have a similar effect on the expression of genes that are down-regulated in NF-YA overexpressing lines. In the CRES-T system, the fusion of a TF to the EAR-motif repression domain (SRDX) causes the repression of the genes whose promoters are normally recognized by the native TF. To avoid possible lethality caused by strong repression of the NF-YAs targets, we cloned the NF-YASRDX fusions under the control of the inducible XVE system.. We obtained at least 5 independent transgenic lines harboring the PXVE:NF-YA2SRDX construct. After an initial evaluation of the phenotype of these lines, seeds of two representative lines were germinated in media supplemented with different estradiol concentrations (20 nM to 20 M). Eight day-old PXVE:NF-YASRDX2 seedlings showed a strong dwarf phenotype which was proportional to the estradiol concentration (Figure S15A to S15D), while untreated seeds from this line showed normal morphology (data not shown). The phenotype of these NF-YA repressor lines was similar but more drastic than that observed for NF-YA overexpressing lines.. Microarray analysis of the PXVE:NF-YA2SRDX line showed that the repressor version of NF-YA2 caused a strong down-regulation in gene expression since 832 of the 1104 differentially expressed genes suffered a strong repression (Dataset S1). Comparison of differentially expressed genes between the PXVE:NF-YA2 and PXVE:NF-YA2SRDX lines showed little overlap among up-regulated genes (Figure 5D), whereas 56% of repressed genes in PXVE:NF-YA2 were also repressed in the chimeric repressor line (Figure 5E). Moreover, of 121 down-regulated genes common among the four PXVE:NF-YA lines, 107 were also repressed in PXVE:NF-YA2SRDX (Dataset S1). Clustering array data from the NF-YA2 repressor line using the Pearson correlation and average linkage clustering confirmed that the expression profiles of PXVE:NF-YA2SRDX and PXVE:NF-YA lines were similar (Figure 5C, Dataset S2). The phenotype of NF-YA2 repressor lines and the similarity of the effect of overexpression of NF-YA2 and its repressor version on global gene expression suggests that NF-YAs could act as repressors. Therefore, it is possible that NF-YAs could act both as transcriptional activators of genes, whose promoters contain the CCAAT-box (as previously documented in other systems) and as repressors of a subset of genes that lack the CCAAT-box. However, formal demonstration of these activator and repressor activities requires additional experimentation.. . . Potential NF-YA target genes. Comparison of the microarray data for the NF-YA2 OE line with that of the chimeric NF-YA2 repressor would allow the identification of the genes that are directly regulated by NF-YA2. We expected that genes whose expression is deregulated (both positively and negatively) in the NF-YA2 OE line and down-regulated in the PXVE:NFYA2SRDX line, would represent direct targets of NF-YA2. With this idea in mind we inspected the list of the differentially expressed genes, whose level of expression varied by at least two-fold (p-value0.05), for both PXVE:NF-YA2 and PXVE:NFYA2SRDX lines, and found that out of 832 down-regulated genes in the PXVE:NFYA2SRDX line, 202 genes were differentially expressed in PXVE:NF-YA2, of which 9 were induced and 193 were repressed. A search for cis-acting elements using the Athena and Promomer web tools in the 193 common genes, showed a similar motif overrepresentation to that obtained for the complete lists of differentially expressed genes (Table S6 and S7).. Because many of the genes that are down-regulated by the chimeric NF-YA2 repressor did not pass the cut off value in the NF-YA2 OE line, it is possible that these genes represent a group that is directly regulated by the NF-Y complex, but whose expression is not affected by overexpression of only one of the subunits of the complex, considering that the complete NF-YA/NF-YB/NF-YC heterotrimer is necessary to bind CCAAT-box containing promoters [4], [46]. A survey of conserved motifs in the promoters of 322 down-regulated genes in the PXVE:NF-YA2SRDX line, whose expression was not significantly altered in PXVE:NF-YA2 (Dataset S4), revealed that the CCAAT motif was overrepresented in this set of genes (Z-score=3.4, significance value=0.001) and that 69% of them (223) have one or more CCAAT boxes (Dataset S4), which represents more than a 2-fold increase compared to the 30% normally found in eukaryotic promoters [3]. These results suggest that NF-YA positively regulates the expression of promoters containing the CCAAT-box and when converted into a repressor down-regulates their expression. Additional experiments, such as transactivation using protoplast systems will be required to provide direct evidence of the activator and repressor activities suggested by our data..
PMC3733157	Results. . Activation pattern of the Arabidopsis AtMYB60 promoter in rice, tobacco, and tomato. To investigate the activity of the guard cell-specific AtMYB60 promoter in cereals, stable transgenic lines of rice (spp. japonica cv. Nipponbare), expressing the reporter GUS under the control of the full-length (1.3kb) or the minimal (246bp) regulatory region of AtMYB60, were generated (AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS and AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines, respectively). Thirty hygromycin-resistant primary transformants (T0) were recovered for each construct, and the presence of the transgene was investigated by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). Staining of developing T0. AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS or AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS leaves did not reveal GUS expression in guard cells or in any other cell type (Fig. 1A, B). Consistently, RT-PCR analysis of the T1 seedlings did not detect expression of the reporter gene (Supplementary Fig. S1). These findings suggest the absence of a MYB60-related regulatory network in the guard cell of rice, which might reflect the functional divergence in stomata between monocots and dicots (Serna, 2011).. .

Leaves from the AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS lines were incubated in the staining solution for 24h (A, C, E, G), whereas leaves from the AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines were incubated for 48h (B, D, F, H). Bar=50 mum.. . . . Next, the conservation of the cellular specificity of the AtMYB60 promoter was investigated in dicot systems, with the two Solanaceae crop species tobacco (cv. Samsun) and tomato (cv. Microtom and cv. Moneymaker). Histochemical analysis of 10-15 independent T0. AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS or AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines for each genotype revealed specific GUS staining in guard cells distributed on developing leaves (Fig. 1C-H). In agreement with data from Arabidopsis, which demonstrate that the full-length 1.3kb AtMYB60 promoter possesses stronger activity in guard cells (Cominelli et al., 2011), stomata from AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS plants showed more intense GUS signals, compared with AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS individuals, in both tobacco and tomato.. Independent T2. AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS and AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS tobacco and tomato lines (n=10) were selected to investigate further the cell and tissue specificity of GUS expression during plant development. Ten-day-old AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS seedlings displayed expression of the reporter exclusively in guard cells, distributed on cotyledons, hypocotyls, and leaf primordia, in all the tobacco (Fig. 2A, B) and tomato (Fig. 2D, E) lines analysed. No GUS signals were detected in roots (insets in Fig. 2A, D). Similarly, AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS tomato and tobacco seedlings showed GUS expression exclusively in guard cells, even though the intensity of the staining was reduced compared with seedlings harbouring the AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS construct (data not shown). Analysis of developing and mature leaves confirmed the guard cell-specific expression of the reporter in both species (Fig. 2C, F). In flowers, consistent GUS expression in guard cells located on sepals was detected (Supplementary Fig. S2A, E at JXB online). Occasionally, diffuse and intense staining of anthers was observed in individual flowers from tomato, whereas weak localized signals were found in the inner part of tobacco anthers (Supplementary Fig. S2). These findings are in contrast to the lack of GUS expression in reproductive tissues reported for both the AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS and AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS constructs in Arabidopsis (Cominelli et al., 2011). However, GUS activity was also observed in anthers of flowers from untransformed Moneymaker, Microtom, and tobacco plants (Supplementary Fig. S2). It is thus likely that GUS expression in male reproductive organs originated from an anther-specific endogenous GUS activity, which has been previously described for different members of the Solanaceae family, including tomato (Plegt and Bino, 1989).. .

The activity of the AtMYB60 promoter is negatively regulated by ABA and dehydration in tobacco and tomato guard cells.. In Arabidopsis, the activity of the full-length AtMYB60 promoter is rapidly down-regulated following exogenous applications of ABA, whereas the 246bp minimal promoter is not affected by the hormone (Cominelli et al., 2011). ABA treatment of AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS tobacco and Microtom plants caused a marked reduction in histochemical detection of GUS signals in guard cells compared with mock-treated plants (Fig. 3A). These results were substantiated by qPCR analyses of two randomly selected lines, which showed significant down-regulation of the level of GUS transcripts upon ABA application (P < 0.001 for all time points, paired Students t-test) (Fig. 3B, D). A comparable down-regulation of GUS staining and GUS transcript abundance was also evident when leaves were subject to 6h of dehydration (Fig. 3A, C, E). The same results were obtained when Moneymaker AtMYB60. pro. 1.3:GUS tomato plants were exposed to ABA or dehydration (data not shown).. . Fig. 3.. .

Relative GUS transcript levels were determined using GUS-specific primers and normalized to the expression of the tobacco or tomato EF1alpha genes.. . . . ABA treatment of the AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines yielded conflicting results. Nearly 80% of the Microtom (n=10), Moneymaker (n=10), or tobacco (n=15) lines analysed did not show obvious changes in the intensity of GUS staining in response to ABA (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, the remaining 20% of the lines displayed marked down-regulation of GUS activity in guard cells, following exposure to ABA (Fig. 4A). These results were further confirmed by qPCR analysis of GUS expression in randomly selected lines (Fig. 4B, C). Nonetheless, dehydration treatments resulted in a drastic decrease of GUS expression in both ABA-insensitive and ABA-sensitive lines, suggesting a possible ABA-independent regulation of the 246bp minimal promoter in response to stress (Fig. 4A, C, D).. .

Construction of an ABA- and dehydration-inducible guard cell-specific synthetic promoter.. The conserved cellular specificity of the AtMYB60 promoter makes it a potentially valuable tool to manipulate guard cell activity in Solanaceae crops. However, an obvious pitfall for the general applicability of this tool resides in the strong ABA- and dehydration-induced down-regulation of its activity. In the attempt to reprogram the negative response of the AtMYB60 promoter to ABA and dehydration, a novel chimeric promoter was constructed. Such a synthetic regulatory element combined the AtMYB60 guard cell-specific module with the ABA- and stress-inducible rd29A promoter (At5g52310) (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1994). In more detail, the 246bp AtMYB60 minimal promoter was fused to the 214bp region of the rd29A promoter (from -254bp to -40bp), which contains two dehydration-responsive elements (DREs; TACCGACAT), a DRE-core motif (GCCGAC), one activator sequence (as1; TGACGTCA), and one ABA-responsive element (ABRE; TACGTGTC) (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1994; Narusaka et al., 2003). This regulatory region has been shown to activate gene expression strongly in response to osmotic stress through both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways in different plant species (Kasuga et al., 1999, 2004; Wang et al., 2005). The resulting rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246 chimeric promoter was fused to the reporter GUS and transformed in Arabidopsis (Fig. 5A). Fifteen independent T2. rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines were selected for analysis of GUS expression. A previously described AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS line was used as a control for the experiments (Cominelli et al., 2011). Under standard growth conditions, all the transgenic lines expressing GUS under the control of the chimeric promoter showed a weak stomatal GUS pattern, comparable in intensity and distribution to that of the control line (Fig. 5B). In agreement with a previous report (Cominelli et al., 2011), the activity of the 246bp control promoter was largely unaffected by ABA, albeit that it was down-regulated by dehydration. Conversely, both ABA and dehydration treatments triggered a strong increase of GUS expression in the rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines (Fig. 5B). Importantly, augmented GUS signals were only observed in guard cells and not in other cell types. qPCR analysis of three randomly selected lines confirmed the significant induction of GUS transcripts following ABA application or exposure to dehydration (up to 16-fold, P < 0.001, paired Students t-test) (Fig. 5C, D).. . Fig. 5.. . Rewiring of the activity of the AtMYB60 promoter in guard cells. (A) Schematic representation of the rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS construct (not to scale). Grey circles represent DRE-core motifs (GCCGAC), the grey rectangle represents the as1 motif (TGACGTCA), the grey square represents the ABRE motif (TACGTGTC), and black circles represent DOF motifs ([A/T]AAAG). (B) Histochemical localization of GUS activity in guard cells from a 15-day-old AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS Arabidopsis control plant (upper left panel) and from a rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS plant (lower left panel), grown under standard conditions (bar=1mm). Leaves from the AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS control line did not show evident changes in the intensity of the GUS staining following 6h of exposure to 100 muM ABA, whereas they showed reduced staining after 6h of dehydration treatment (upper panels). Conversely, ABA and dehydration tratments induced a drastic increase in GUS activity in the rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS line (lower panels) (bar=50 mum). (C and D) qPCR analysis of GUS expression in response to 100 muM ABA (C) or dehydration (D) in three independent Arabidopsis rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines. (E) Histochemical localization of GUS expression in guard cells of 15-day-old tobacco plants from an ABA-sensitive AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS control line (upper left panel) and from a rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS line (lower left panel), grown under standard conditions (bar=1mm). After 6h of exposure to 100 muM ABA or dehydration, AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS control plants showed a severe decrease in the intensity of the GUS staining (upper panels, arrows indicate stomatal guard cells). In contrast, ABA and dehydration treatments resulted in enhanced GUS activity in the rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines (lower panels) (bar=50 mum). (F and G) qPCR analysis of GUS expression in response to 100 muM ABA (C) or dehydration (D) in two independent tobacco rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines. qPCR experiments in Arabidopsis (C and D) and tobacco (F and G) included an AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS line as a control. Relative GUS transcript levels were determined using gene-specific primers and normalized to the expression of the AtACTIN2 gene (At3g18780) in (C) and (D), or using the NtEF1alpha gene in (F) and (G).. . . . Next, the rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS construct was introduced in tobacco and tomato to test whether the synthetic promoter retained its cellular specificity and its responsiveness in these two species. Histochemical analysis of 10 independent T2 tobacco lines revealed expression of the reporter exclusively in stomatal guard cells, with an intensity of staining similar to the AtMYB60. pro. 246:GUS line, used as a control (Fig. 5E). Following application of ABA or exposure to dehydration, all the rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines showed significant up-regulation of GUS expression, as demonstrated by both the intensity of the staining (Fig. 5E) and the level of the GUS transcripts (Fig. 5F, G, up to 14-fold, P < 0.001, paired Students t-test). Notably, after 6h of exposure to dehydration, plants showed severe symptoms of wilting (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). Yet, the rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS lines still showed intense GUS staining in stomata distributed on the damaged tissue. Comparable results, in terms of both cellular specificity and ABA- and dehydration-induced up-regulation of GUS expression, were obtained in tomato plants transformed with the rd29A-MYB60. pro. 246:GUS construct (Supplementary Fig. S4).. As a whole, these findings validate the use of the AtMYB60 minimal promoter to engineer synthetic regulatory modules to activate gene expression in guard cells in response to hormonal signals and environmental cues, in both model plant systems and crops..
PMC4014012	Results. . Gene selection and experimental setup. To identify positive epistatic effects on leaf growth, we analyzed pairwise perturbations of 13 genes positively affecting final leaf size in a gain- or loss-of-function situation (Table 1) by measuring the individual and total leaf area. We used lines in the Col-0 background, homozygous for a single-locus insertion of the transgene of interest and shown to have a positive effect on all rosette leaves or a subset of those (Cho and Cosgrove, 2000; Gonzalez et al., 2010; Spartz et al., 2012). This enhanced leaf growth can result from the perturbation of genes affecting cell division and/or cell expansion. The downregulation of SAMBA disturbs the early stage of leaf development, since larger meristems are formed resulting in larger leaves containing more cells (Eloy et al., 2012). A point mutation in DA1 or the downregulation of its enhancer, EOD1, leads to the production of larger leaves with more cells due to an extended cell proliferation phase (Li et al., 2008). Similarly, in plants overexpressing ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), AINTEGUMENTA (ANT), ARABIDOPSIS VACUOLAR-PYROPHOSPHATASE (AVP1), GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR5 (GRF5) under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter or BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) under the control of its own promoter, larger leaves containing more cells are formed because of an extension of the cell proliferation phase (Wang et al., 2001; Horiguchi et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005). On the other hand, an increased cell proliferation at the edge of the leaf and a prolonged period of meristemoid division are observed when the miRNA JAW is overexpressed and the PEAPOD (PPD) genes are downregulated (Palatnik et al., 2003; White, 2006). When GIBBERELLIN 20-OXIDASE 1 (GA20OX1) is overexpressed, an increase in cell number and cell size leads to the formation of larger leaves (Huang et al., 1998; Gonzalez et al., 2010). Finally, in plants overexpressing EXPANSIN 10 (EXP10) and SMALL AUXIN UP-REGULATED RNA 19 (SAUR19) fused to a GFP tag, bigger leaves containing larger cells are produced (Cho and Cosgrove, 2000; Spartz et al., 2012). Several of these leaf growth-promoting genes are involved in hormonal pathways, confirming the importance of plant hormones in the regulation of growth processes: BRI1 encodes a brassinosteroid receptor, GA20OX1 catalyzes rate-limiting steps in late gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis, ANT has been suggested to be involved in auxin signal transduction and both AVP1 and SAUR19 in auxin transport (Huang et al., 1998; Mizukami and Fischer, 2000; Wang et al., 2001; Li et al., 2005; Spartz et al., 2012). To obtain pairwise perturbations, our strategy was to cross the homozygous transgenic lines and to analyze the heterozygous progeny. We produced 102 heterozygous combinations, consisting of 78 paired combinations and 24 back-crosses with the wild type (WT) used as controls (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). Because the homozygous line can be used as pollen donor or receptor, care was taken that the crosses with the wild-type plants, producing the heterozygous control line, maintained the same directionality. For example, a cross between ami-ppd () and SAUR19OE () was compared to the offspring of the crosses ami-ppd () X WT () and WT () X SAUR19OE (). This approach standardizes for possible maternal effects (Scott et al., 1998). Next, we checked the expression levels of the transgenes in the obtained heterozygous double mutants as well as in the heterozygous control lines. In the majority of the combinations, transgene expression levels were comparable with those of the heterozygous controls (Figure 1-figure supplement 2). In total, 61 combinations were used for further growth analysis. Sixteen plants per genotype were grown in three independent repeats and at 21 days after stratification (DAS), the size of each individual leaf of the rosette was measured, resulting in 56,505 data-points, enabling us to estimate potential gene interactions for these quantitative traits (Figure 1-figure supplement 3). Leaf area (LA) of the paired combinations was compared to a theoretical, expected if non-interacting value (EXPni), based on the size of the WT and both heterozygous controls. To estimate the EXPni, we applied an additive model on a multiplicative scale by transforming the data on log2 scale (Koornneef et al., 1998; Phillips, 2008; Horn et al., 2011):log2(LAEXPni)=log2(LAheterozygouscontrol1)+log2(LAheterozygouscontrol2)-log2(LAwildtype)10.7554/eLife.02252.003Table 1.Growth regulators and transgenics used for the binary combinationsDOI:. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02252.003Gene nameGene symbolGene IDLine namePerturbationCellular process promotedReferenceANGUSTIFOLIA3AN3AT5G28640AN3OEOECell division(Horiguchi et al., 2005)AINTEGUMENTAANTAT4G37750ANTOEOECell division(Mizukami and Fischer, 2000)ARABIDOPSIS V-PYROPHOSPHATASEAVP1AT1G15690AVP1OEOECell division(Li et al., 2005)BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1BRI1AT4G39400BRI1OEOECell division(Wang et al., 2001; Gonzalez et al., 2010)DA1DA1AT1G19270da1-1LOFCell division(Li et al., 2008)ENHANCER OF DA1-1/BIG BROTHEREOD/BBAT3G63530eod1-2LOFCell division(Li et al., 2008)EXPANSIN 10EXP10AT1G26770EXP10OEOECell expansion(Cho and Cosgrove, 2000)GIBBERELLIN 20 OXIDASE 1GA20OX1AT4G25420GA20OX1OEOECell division and expansion(Huang et al., 1998; Gonzalez et al., 2010)GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR5GRF5AT3G13960GRF5OEOECell division(Horiguchi et al., 2005)miR-JAW/ miRNA 319miR-JAWAT4G23713jaw-DOECell division(Palatnik et al., 2003)PEAPODPPDAT4G14713 and AT4G14720ami-ppdLOFMeristemoid division(White, 2006; Gonzalez et al., 2010)SAMBASAMBAAT1G32310sambaLOFCell division and expansion(Eloy et al., 2012)SMALL AUXIN UP RNA 19SAUR19AT5G18010SAUR19OEOECell expansion(Spartz et al., 2012)OE: over-expression, LOF: loss of function.. In order to identify combinations with synergistic or negative effects on leaf growth, we searched for significant leaf-genotype interactions (FDR <0.05). The significance of the difference between the EXPni and the observed value was determined using a mixed model (Materials and methods). This calculation and comparison was done for each combination (Figure 1-figure supplement 4-64). The LAs were analyzed using repeated measurements to take into account dependencies between the different leaves of the rosette. We also calculated the total rosette area, defined as the sum of all individual leaves. Similarly as for leaf area, a rosette EXPni was calculated.. . . Identification of positive and negative epistasis effects on leaf growth. Among the 61 combinations analyzed, 23 pairwise crosses, almost 38%, were found to have a rosette size significantly exceeding the EXPni value (FDR <0.05, Figures 1 and 2). In the strongest synergistic combinations, such as BRI1OE-eod1-2, BRI1OE-EXP10OE, BRI1OE-SAUR19OE, GRF5OE-SAUR19OE, BRI1OE-da1-1, ami-ppd-SAUR19OE and samba-eod1-2 (at least 20% larger than the EXPni), the positive effect on size was observed for all rosette leaves. Remarkably, although out of the 13 genes that were selected for this screen only two are involved in increasing cell size (EXP10OE and SAUR19OE), almost half of the synergistic combinations arose from combining cell proliferation-stimulating gene perturbations with these two cell expansion-promoting genes, particularly with SAUR19OE (Figure 2; Table 1). We also observed a positive epistasis in the majority of the combinations with samba, BRI1OE or SAUR19OE, suggesting that these growth regulators are more prone to lead to synergistic effects in binary combinations (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A).10.7554/eLife.02252.004Figure 1.Heat map representing the effect of the binary combinations for rosette and leaf area.The outer ring shows the percentage of the rosette size of the combinations compared to the WT (C/W). In the middle rings, percentages of the observed sizes of the cotyledons (L0) until leaf 6 (L6) and the complete rosette are shown compared to the expected if non-interacting value (EXPni).

Of all binary crosses analyzed, 39.2% resulted in plants with a rosette size exceeding that of both heterozygous control lines and the WT (Figure 1; Supplementary file 1). Interestingly, 16 combinations resulted from a synergistic effect, while eight were the result of an additive effect. Among the largest plants, synergistic (GRF5OE-SAUR19OE and ANTOE-SAUR19OE, 39% and 38% larger than the WT, respectively) and additive (da1-1-GA20ox1OE and ANTOE-AVP1OE, 38% and 36% larger than the WT, respectively) effects could be found.. In addition, we also found that 23% of the combinations led to the formation of smaller rosettes than expected. We observed that mainly combinations with jaw-D and ami-ppd led to cases of negative epistasis. The total rosette area of these combinations was similar or much smaller than that of WT plants, such as GRF5-jaw-D (46% smaller than the WT), with the exception of da1-1-ami-ppd, which was larger than the WT, but smaller than da1-1-Col-0. (Figure 1).. In conclusion, from this screen, we found that more than one third of the combinations showed positive epistasis on leaf growth, resulting from combining either two genes both stimulating cell proliferation, or either one gene enhancing cell proliferation and the other cell expansion.. . . Reciprocal and homozygous combinations. To strengthen the observed effects of pairwise perturbations and to further exclude that the observed phenotypes were influenced by maternal effects, we made reciprocal crosses of selected synergistic combinations (SAUR19OE-ami-ppd, EXP10OE-BRI1OE, SAUR19OE-BRI1OE). We measured the leaf area at 21 DAS and could confirm the synergistic effects for all three combinations (Figure 3A, Figure 3-figure supplement 1-3). Next, we generated homozygous lines for two synergistic combinations, ami-ppd-SAUR19OE and samba-eod1-2, and one additive combination, producing nevertheless a very large rosette, da1-1-SAUR19OE. Transgene expression levels in these homozygous lines were verified and found comparable to those in the homozygous single lines (Figure 3-figure supplement 4). We confirmed a synergistic effect on the rosette sizes in homozygous ami-ppd-SAUR19OE and samba-eod1-2 plants (24% and 8% larger than the rosette EXPni respectively) (Figure 3B, Figure 3-figure supplement 5,6). The combination da1-1-SAUR19OE, which produced among the largest plants in the screen, but did not enhance leaf size synergistically, was also found to be particularly large when homozygous, since its rosette size was 61% larger than that of the WT (Figure 3B, Figure 3-figure supplement 7, Figure 2-figure supplement 2). From these experiments we could confirm the observed positive epistatic effects in a selected set of double mutants from our screen of heterozygous combinations in a reciprocal direction and/or homozygous status.10.7554/eLife.02252.072Figure 3.Heat map representing the effect of the binary combinations for rosette and leaf area (A) in reciprocal heterozygous crosses and (B) homozygous lines.C/W represents the percentage of the rosette size of the combinations compared to the WT.

Cellular analysis of ami-ppd-SAUR19OE. In order to explain the cause for the observed synergistic phenotype at a cellular level, we quantified cell numbers and cell size in the homozygous combination ami-ppd-SAUR19OE. In the ami-ppd line, in which PPD1 and PPD2 expression is downregulated, the increased leaf size results from a prolonged division of meristemoids (White, 2006), whereas overexpression of SAUR19 leads to cell enlargement (Spartz et al., 2012). Samples of leaf 3 were harvested at 21 DAS, cleared and cell drawings of the abaxial epidermis were analyzed. As shown in Figure 4, the larger leaves of SAUR19OE contain less but larger cells, whereas in leaves of ami-ppd more cells are produced. In the latter, an observed reduction in average cell area results from the presence of a larger amount of smaller cells surrounding the stomata which do not reach the mature wild-type size (Figure 4B). In the homozygous ami-ppd-SAUR19OE line, we observed an increased cell number compared to the WT, but to a lower extend than in the ami-ppd line, and an increased cell area similar to that of SAUR19OE. Thus the effect of SAUR19OE allows for an increased cell expansion of the many small cells resulting from PPD downregulation.10.7554/eLife.02252.080Figure 4.Cellular basis of the difference in leaf size observed for the homozygous line amippd-SAUR19OE and the corresponding controls.(A) The graphs represent the percentage difference of leaf area, cell number and cell area between a transgenic and the WT.

PMC2265440	Results. Shoot tissue from a geographically diverse panel of 98 Arabidopsis accessions (93 from [5] plus Bu-15, Col-4, Kas-1, Ler-0, Ler-2) was screened in an effort to identify accessions which have altered Mo content in shoot tissue (Figure 1A). Based on this survey it was determined that the shoot content of Mo in Arabidopsis is under genetic control (broad sense heritability H2=0.48), with an approximately 20-fold difference between the highest and lowest Mo levels observed (Figure 1A) across the diverse set of Arabidopsis accession tested. Shoot Mo content was found to be not normally distributed around the population mean (p<0.001), with 12 accessions (Ler-0, Ler-1, Ler-2, Van-0, Zdr-6, Kondara, KZ-9, Shadahara, Sorbo, Ll-0, Ts-5, Ws-0) accumulating less than 0.7 g g-1 Mo, and 9 accessions (Ull2-5, Bur-0,Cvi-0, Nfa-10, Tamm-2, Tamm-27, Fab-2, Var2-1, Spr1-6) accumulating more than 3.1 g g-1 Mo (grey bars in Figure 1A). We had previously identified Ler as a low Mo accumulating accession of Arabidopsis [6] and all Ler lines tested (which are likely genetically identical), were low in Mo. Shoot tissue of Ler-0 contains 70-80% less Mo compared to Col-0 (Figure 1B), and this difference from Col-0 is observed for Ler-0 when plants were grown with a broad range of Mo concentrations in the nutrient solution (Figure 1C). We selected this accession for further study due to the extensive genetic resources available for this accession, including the availability of genome sequence data and recombinant inbred lines (RIL), along with high density genotype data [7],[8].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000004.g001. Figure 1. . Genetic and physiological analysis of mo in arabidopsis.. A: Shoot Mo content across 98 accessions. Histogram of shoot Mo content in 98 Arabidopsis accessions which include 94 from Nordborg et al. (2005). Black bars indicate the distribution of lines having the mot1. Ler-0 deletion. Grey lines denote the low and high accessions, as detailed in the text. The black arrow denotes Col-0 Mo content. Shoot Mo concentrations are normalized so that the average of the Col-0 and Cvi-0 means included in each growth tray are equivalent across all trays. Plants were grown in soil for 5 weeks. Data represents median values (average n=11.6) for each accession. B: Mo accumulation of Col-0, Ler-0, Van-0, mot1-1, st5.1-1 and the mot1-1st5.1-1 double mutant. Data is shown as a five number summary (the minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile and maximum) for each line, and is summarized from an average of 10 replicate plants for each line. Lower case letters denote groups that are not significantly different from each other at P<0.01 with the Holm correction. Plants were grown in soil for 5 weeks. C: Shoot Mo accumulation in Arabidopsis in response to increasing levels of Mo in the nutrient solution. Mo accumulation in Col-0 (Black) and Ler-0 (Red) after 5 weeks of growth in soil at varying concentrations of Mo in the watering solution. Data is shown as a five number summary for each line, and is summarized from 6 replicate plants for each treatment.. . . . The analysis of Mo in shoot and root tissue of hydroponically grown Ler-0 and Col-0 plants confirmed the low shoot Mo content of Ler-0 (Figure 2A). Furthermore, Ler-0 also has a reduced Mo content in roots when compared to Col-0, suggesting that the low shoot Mo content is not due to enhanced accumulation of Mo in the roots, but rather to reduced Mo uptake by the roots. Grafting experiments were performed to determine if low shoot Mo in Ler-0 is determined by the root or shoot. Shoots and roots from 5-day old seedlings of Ler-0 and Col-0 were reciprocally grafted, and grafted plants grown for 4 weeks in soil with short days. Plants with Ler-0 roots had significantly lower (p<0.01) shoot Mo contents than plants with Col-0 roots, whether the shoots were Ler-0 or Col-0. The genotype of the shoot stock had no significant effect on Mo content of the shoot (Figure 3). From this it was concluded that the low shoot Mo content of Ler-0 is driven solely by the roots.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000004.g002. Figure 2. . Mo content in the roots and shoots of plants grown hydroponically..

Shoot mo accumulation in Ler-0 is driven by the roots.. Mo contents in Arabidopsis plants grafted at 5 days after germination and transferred to soil for growth were determined in self grafted plants of Col-0 (n=32) and Ler-0 (n=11), Col-0 shoot grafted onto Ler-0 root (n=22), and Ler-0 shoot grafted onto Col-0 root (n=15). Data is shown as a five number summary (the minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile and maximum) for each line with outliers denoted by small circles.. . . . . Mapping the Loci Responsible for the Low Mo Content of the Landsberg Erecta Arabidopsis Accession. In a Ler-0Col-0 cross 51 of the 200 F2 progeny analyzed were found to have low shoot Mo contents similar to the Ler-0 parent. This ratio is consistent with the hypothesis that the low Mo phenotype in Ler-0 is controlled by a single locus, or several closely linked loci (p<0.00001 by Shapiro test for normality). Similar segregation patterns were observed in an F2 population derived from a Ler-0 cross to an ionomics mutant (14501) in the Col-0 background. To obtain a rough map position, a bulk segregant analysis (BSA) experiment [9] was performed with microarray detection of genetic markers [10],[11], using (14501[Col-0]Ler-0) F2 plants. Plants with the lowest shoot Mo contents (n=40) and plants with Mo shoot contents similar to Col-0 (n=40) were pooled separately, and genomic DNA from each pool hybridized to the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 DNA microarray. Using the oligonucleotide probes on the DNA microarray which show differential hybridization between Ler-0 and Col-0 as genetic markers (Single Feature Polymorphisms or SFP), the locus responsible for the low shoot Mo content in Ler-0 was mapped to an area centered at 11 Mb on chromosome 2 (Figure 4A).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000004.g004. Figure 4. . The locus determining low shoot Mo content in Ler-0 Maps to the MOT1 Gene.. A: Bulk Segregant analysis of the low shoot Mo content in an F2 population from a Col-0Ler-0 cross.Data are presented as a scaled pool hybridization difference (SPHD), representing the difference between the hybridization of the two pools at the SFPs, scaled so that a pure Col-0 pool would be at -1 and a pure Ler-0 pool would be at 1. The pools were prepared from F2 plants with a low Mo content (n=40) and F2 plants with a high Mo content (n=40). SFPs were scored after hybridization of genomic DNA prepared from these pools to Affymetrix ATH1 DNA microarrays. Dotted lines denote likely location of the causal loci. B: Shoot Mo content and genotype on chromosome II of selected Col-0Ler-0 RILs. The genotype of each of the 106 markers determined by Singer et al. (2006) for chromosome II are shown; Col-0 alleles are denoted in black, Ler-0 in white. The average shoot Mo content (n=12) for each line is shown, and, those with Col-0 shoot levels of Mo are underlined. Blue lines indicate the narrowed mapping interval on chromosome II (10.771 to 11.056 Mb). C: Structure of the MOT1 gene. The DNA sequence of MOT1 showing location of the T-DNA insert in mot1-1, and the 50 base pair deletion in the 5 UTR in the seven accessions with low shoot Mo content aligned with the Col-0 DNA sequence, with the TATA box underlined.. . . . To further narrow down the map position of the locus controlling low shoot Mo content in Ler-0, the Col-4Ler-0 RIL population [12] was used to identify seven recombinants in the mapping region we had previously determined from the BSA. DNA microarray-based genotyping of this Col-4Ler-0 RIL set was used to further refine the break points between Col-4 and Ler-0 genotypes [7],[8]. The shoot Mo contents of these seven RILs showed a clear segregation with the genetic markers for Col-4 and Ler-0 within our mapping region, allowing us to classify these lines as having either the Col-0 or the Ler-0 allele for the low Mo locus (Figure 4B). The precise breakpoints identified by Singer et al. [8] allowed the mapping interval to be narrowed to 346 kb on chromosome 2 (10.771 to 11.056 Mb), an interval containing 81 genes. Candidate genes from this interval were selected based on annotation and expression differences between Col-0 and Ler-0 (T. Singer & S. Briggs, personal communication). T-DNA insertional alleles for these candidate genes were obtained, and the plants scored for low shoot Mo content compared to wild type Col-0. A null mutant (mot1-1) with an insertion disrupting the coding region of the gene At2g25680 (Salk_118311, Figure 4D), was observed to phenocopy the Ler-0 low shoot Mo content when grown in either soil (Figure 1B), or shoots and roots when grown hydroponically (Figure 2). Differences in the absolute concentrations of Mo between Col-0 in Figure 2A and 2B are related to differences in growth conditions between these two experiments. The At2g25680 gene was originally predicted to be a putative sulfate transporter, and named AtSULT5.2. [13]. We have renamed this gene MOT1 (molybdenum transporter 1) based on its phenotype of low shoot Mo content. Furthermore, we detected no change in the shoot content of S in mot1-1 (Figure 5) or in the content of Li, B, Na, Mg, P, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, and Cd, providing additional support for the reannotation of AtSULT5.2 as MOT1. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR of the MOT1 transcript in mot1-1 and Ler-0 revealed that both these low shoot Mo lines had significantly reduced expression levels of MOT1 in both root and shoot tissue, compared to Col-0 (Figure 6). Van-0, a second low shoot Mo accession (Figure 1B) was also confirmed by qRT-PCR to have low expression of MOT1 (Figure 6). Significantly, we observed no differences in shoot S content between Col-0 and either Ler-0 or Van-0 (Figure 5).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000004.g005. Figure 5. . Sulfur accumulation in shoots of Col-0, Ler-0, Van-0, mot1-1, st5.1-1 and the mot1-1st5.1-1 double mutant plants.. Data is shown as a five number summary (the minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile and maximum) for each line, and is summarized from an average of 10 replicate plants for each line. No significant differences were observed. Plants were grown in soil for 5 weeks. The data is from the same plants as in Figure 1B.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000004.g006. Figure 6. . Expression of MOT1 in Col-0, Ler-0, Van-0 and mot1-1.. . Steady state MOT1 expression level was compared in shoots (A) and roots (B) of Col-0, Ler-0, Van-0, and mot1-1 using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). RNA was isolated from shoot and root of plants grown in soil for 5 weeks under short day conditions For normalization across samples expression of the Actin 1 gene was used and the relative expression of MOT1 calculated using the 2(-deltaCT) method. Presented data are the means of at least three biological replicates, (2(deltaCT)) each analyzed 4 times by qRT-PCR. Error bars representSD.. . . . To establish if MOT1 is the locus responsible for the low shoot Mo content of Ler-0 and Van-0, we crossed mot1-1 and Col-0 to both Ler-0 and Van-0 to test for complementation (Figure 7). F1 plants from the Ler-0Col-0 and Van-0Col-0 crosses contained significantly different levels of shoot Mo from either parent (p<0.005 for all pairwise t-tests), suggesting that the Col-0 allele of the low Mo locus could only partially complement the Ler-0 allele. F1 plants from the Ler-0mot1-1 and Van-0mot1-1 crosses were found to have significantly lower shoot Mo contents than similar plants from the Ler-0Col-0 and Van-0Col-0 crosses (p<0.0005). Such data establishes that mot1-1 is deficient in complementing the low shoot Mo content of both Ler-0 and Van-0. This is strong evidence confirming that the Ler-0 and Van-0 alleles are allelic with the recessive loss of function allele of MOT1.. . . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000004.g007. Figure 7. . Complementation Studies Indicate MOT1 Natural Variant Is Responsible for Reduced Shoot Mo Content in Ler-0 and Van-0.. Shoot Mo content of Col-0, Ler-0, Van-0, mot1-1, and F1 plants from crosses between Col-0Ler-0, Col-0Van-0, Ler-0mot1-1, Van-0mot1-1and Col-0mot1-1 in 5-week old soil grown plants are shown. Data is represented as a five number summary (the minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile and maximum) for each line, and is summarized from an average of 21 replicate plants for each line. Lower case letters denote groups that are not significantly different from each other at P<0.01 with the Holm correction.. . . . To determine the polymorphism in the MOT1. Ler-0 allele causal for low shoot Mo content, we sequenced MOT1, including 1 kb upstream and 200 bp downstream of the coding sequence in both Ler-0 and Van-0. We observed 18 polymorphisms in common between Ler-0 and Van-0, as well as several polymorphisms unique to each accession, when compared to the Col-0 reference sequence. These include 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 1 kb upstream region, two SNPs that change two amino acids (I68T and V30L) in the coding region, and a 53 base pair (bp) deletion 27 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site (Text S1). The deletion includes the TATA box (Figure 4C). The altered expression of MOT1 in both of the low shoot Mo accessions, Ler-0 and Van-0, suggested that this 5 deletion may be the causal polymorphism driving low shoot Mo content in these accessions. To obtain further evidence that this deletion is the casual polymorphism driving low shoot Mo content, we performed an association analysis by sequencing the MOT1 5 promoter region containing the 53 bp deletion in Ler-0 and Van-0 across 92 of the accessions originally screened for shoot Mo content (Text S2). Combining this information with the Nordborg [5] genotypes, we were able to scan for significant genetic associations with low shoot Mo content. The 53 bp deletion identified in Ler-0 and Van-0 was found in seven of the 92 accessions tested, and all accessions with the deletion had low shoot Mo content compared to the overall distribution of shoot Mo contents (Figures 4C and 1A). The distribution of p-values for genome-wide associations with shoot Mo contents were skewed towards significance, suggesting a relationship between Mo content and the underlying population structure (Figure S1), making the evaluation of individual loci difficult. However, when kinship and population structure were taken into account [14], the presence of the 53 bp deletion was found to be highly significantly associated with low shoot Mo content (p<0.0001) and accounted for 14% of the total variation in Mo accumulation. Once the MOT1. Ler loci is accounted for, there were several other markers which showed significant associations with Mo accumulation, and these may represent additional loci of interest (Text S3).. To establish that MOT1 has the capacity to transport Mo, the Arabidopsis MOT1 cDNA was expressed in yeast. Yeast expressing MOT1 were observed to specifically accumulate five time more Mo than vector only controls (p<1E-14, Figure 8). Furthermore, the accumulation of no other element, including Na, Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd, was observed to be altered more than 20% in two independent experiments. This evidence is consistent with MOT1 being a specific molybdate transporter.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000004.g008. Figure 8. . Cell Associated Mo in Yeast Expressing Arabidopsis MOT1.. Cell associated Mo in yeast transformed with either p416 vector only or vector containing cDNAs encoding ST5.1 and MOT1 after growth for 24 hours. Data is represented as a five number summary (the minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile and maximum) for each line, and is summarized from n=32 replicate yeast cultures for each genotype.. . . . . . Localization of MOT1 Expression and Sub-Cellular Localization of the MOT1 Protein. To determine the tissue localization of MOT1 expression, Col-0 was transformed with a 1.8 kb MOT1 promoter-GUS construct. In all of the promoter-GUS lines examined, GUS staining was observed in the roots, hypocotyls and leaves (Figure 9). In roots, GUS staining was most pronounced just behind the growing root tip in the primary root (Figure 9A, B), and the lateral roots (data not shown). Cross sections show that the strong GUS staining behind the root tip was restricted mainly to the protodermal cells (Figure 9B2). At the beginning of the elongation zone, GUS staining was mainly restricted to the epidermis and cortex (Figure 9C2). Thereafter, GUS staining in the root also occurred in the vascular tissue (Figure 9D). In the hypocotyls the GUS staining was also mainly restricted to the vascular tissue (Figure 9E). In fully expanded leaves GUS staining was found in the vascular tissue. However, the main vein was less intensely stained than the lateral veins (Figure 9F). During flowering GUS activity was also visible in the vasculature of the stem leaves but not in the vasculature of the stem, flowers or developing siliques including seeds (data not shown).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000004.g009.

Pd - protoderm; co - cortex; vb vascular bundle; ep - epidermis.. . . . The sub-cellular localization of the MOT1 protein was determined by transiently expressing a MOT1 C-terminal GFP translational fusion construct in shoot derived Col-0 protoplasts (Figure 10A-10D), and by stable ectopic expression of a similar construct in Col-0 (Figure 10E-10G). The GFP signal was observed to co-localize with the mitochondrial marker F-ATPase-RFP in shoot derived protoplasts transiently expressing the construct, and with the Mitotracker Red dye in roots of the stably transformed lines. The experimentally determined mitochondrial localization for MOT1 is in good agreement with several sub-cellular prediction programs (summarized at the SUBA database, [15]), which predict a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N-terminus of MOT1.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000004.g010.

MOT1::GFP was transiently expressed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts co transformed with F1-ATPase::RFP: (A) DIC (B) GFP filter (C) RFP filter and (D) merged image. Roots of Arabidopsis stably transformed with MOT1::GFP and stained with Mitotracker Red: (E) Red Filter (F) GFP Filter (G) Merged.. . . . Phylogenetic analysis of the sulfate transporter family in Arabidopsis and rice [13],[16] reveal two Arabidopsis genes, MOT1 and ST5.1, to have diverged significantly from the other sulfate transporter family members, and each Arabidopsis gene has a rice ortholog. Given the sequence similarity between ST5.1 and MOT1, the shoot Mo content of a st5.1-1 T-DNA insertion line (Salk_015044) was analyzed to determine if it also shows the low Mo phenotype observed in mot1-1. We were unable to detect any significant changes in the Mo content of shoot of st5.1-1 when grown in soil and the roots and shoot Mo accumulation of a mot1-1/st5.1-1 double mutant was not significantly different from the mot1-1 mutant alone. (Figures 1B and 2B). The Mo content of yeast heterologously expressing the ST5.1 cDNA was found not to be reproducibly significantly different from vector only controls in two independent experiments (Figure 8). Thus, we can find no evidence that ST5.1 is also a Mo transporter. A search of the PiiMS database [4]; www.purdue.edu/ionomics) found four T-DNA lines with insertions in sulfate transporters, representing the ST1, ST2 and ST3 subfamilies (At3g15990, At4g02700, At1g77990, At4g08620), none of which accumulated significantly different levels of Mo than Col-0..
PMC4381405	Results and discussion. . The transcriptome represents a major source for lesquerella seed genes. To obtain a comprehensive profile of the transcriptome of lesquerella seeds, selecting a sample at an optimal stage during seed development is critical. According to our previous studies in lesquerella, the entire course of seed development took about 49 days after pollination (DAP) [52]. When developing seeds entered mid-maturation stages, 28-35 DAP, storage lipids, proteins, and other components of dry weights accumulated at maximum rates. Based on analysis of HFA accumulation and gene expression [5], we observed rapid synthesis and accumulation of TAG and major HFA (20:1-OH) from 28 to 35 DAP. Accompanying the accumulation of 20:1-OH, transcript levels of hydroxylase gene, PfFAH12, and elongase gene, PfKCS18, also increased steadily [5]. The collective data suggest that seeds at 28-35 DAP are enriched in the transcripts for enzymes involved in the synthesis and accumulation of 20:1-OH. Therefore, we determined that 30 DAP is a suitable time point for seed transcriptomic analyses. By twice deep sequencing using a cDNA library prepared from developing lesquerella seeds at 30 DAP, we generated a total of 1,568,943 clean reads which is equivalent to 651,314,783 bases (Table1). Because there is no reference genome of lesquerella, de novo assembly was performed by GS De Novo Assembler (v 2.6). Among total reads, 496,246 reads were completely assembled and 109,151 reads were partially assembled to generate total 38,002 isotigs (Table2). The average isotig length is 988 bp (Table2), longer than the average isotig size of 828 bp observed in bitter melon seed transcriptome using Cap3 assembly software [53], 744 bp in Ammopiptanthus monolicus root transcriptome using Newbler [54], and 697 bp in Camelina sativa seed transcriptome using Trinity [55]. A mean isotig length of 1492  899 bp was reported for camelina seed transcriptome [56]. However, this number was obtained by assembling 454 reads (mean length, 373  129 bp) together with Sanger sequenced EST clones (mean length, 555  169 bp) using NEWBLER v2.3 GS Assembler. About 35,573 reads not overlapping with any other reads were assembled to 21,912 singletons (Tables1 and 2). Since our singletons were cleaned and validated with SeqClean and Lucy, the numbers of singletons and isotigs in combination indicate 59,914 total protein coding transcripts in our seed transcriptome. Overall, isotigs and singletons together were assembled from 640,970 reads which counted 41% of total reads (Table1). About 57% of reads were identified as repeated regions (Table1). A total of 901,748 repeat region reads were blast searched in SILVA rRNA database [57]. Among them, 863,953 reads (96%) matched rRNA sequences and 37,795 reads (4%) had no homologies. The rRNA sequences encode 28S, 26S, 18S, and 16S ribosomal RNAs. These rRNAs were probably carried over during mRNA purification process. The assembly analysis also generated 26,995 isogroups (Table2), which represent 26,995 unique genes in the lesquerella seed transcriptome (Table2).Table 1. Summary of sequencing reads.

Among 38,002 isotigs and 21,912 singletons, 33,313 isotigs (88%) and 11,247singletons (51%) had at least one match to known protein sequences in the NCBI NR database. These isotigs or singletons fell mainly into three GO categories: biological process (11,977, 32% for isotigs; 4,641, 21% for singletons), cellular component (9,648, 25% for isotigs; 2,850, 13% for singletons), and molecular function (11,687, 31% for isotigs; 3,756, 17% for singletons). The remaining 4,689 (12%) isotigs and 10,663 (49%) singletons were not assigned (Figures1A, 2A). In the category of biological process, a substantial percent of isotigs (22.8%) (Figure1B) and singletons (18.8%) (Figure2B) were classified in sub-category metabolic process. In category cellular component, cell part had a largest percent of isotigs (26.4%) (Figure1B) and singletons (28.5%) (Figure2B). Within the category of molecular function, catalytic activity and binding are the two top sub-categories, with 34.9% and 34.0% respectively for isotigs, (Figure1B), and 28.4% and 29% respectively for singletons (Figure2B). As indicated above, the assemble analysis also generated 26,995 isogroups or unique genes. When these unique genes were searched against NCBI NR database, 19,861 isogroups (74%) matched annotated coding genes, whereas 3,134 found no homologous sequences. Besides, about 18,868 (95%) of the 19,861 isogroups with matches to known protein coding sequences had the highest homology to genes from Arabidopsis, a model dicot plant. Table3 lists the top 50 most highly expressed genes represented by isogroups in the lesquerella seed transcriptome and their corresponding gene products based Arabidopsis orthologs. Among them, genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism were detected. These included genes encoding fatty acid desaturase 3 (FAD3), 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (PfKCS18), acyl-activating enzyme 17 (AAE17), hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 5 (HSD5) and oleosins. Overall, these results demonstrate that the transcriptome data presented here provide comprehensive representation of expressed genes in developing lesquerella seed. These annotations provide a major new resource for investigating specific processes, structures, functions, and pathways that will guide research on lesquerella. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis indicates that lesquerella is closely related to Arabidopsis, which allows for translational research for seed quality enhancement in lesquerella.Figure 1.

The transcriptome covers a broad spectrum of genes involved in acyl-lipid metabolism. Since lesquerella is a Brassicaceae oilseed crop, we used the acyl-lipid metabolism database [58] developed for model Brassicaceae oilseed Arabidopsis [31] to investigate lesquerella genes involved in acyl-lipid metabolism. We queried the transcriptome assembly to predict lesquerella orthologs of Arabidopsis lipid metabolic pathway components using reciprocal best-hits (RBH) blast approach. A total of 1,066 Arabidopsis genes from 16 sub acyl-lipid metabolism group from the lipid metabolism database [58] were used to query the lesquerella transcriptome using local blastN. Although our lesquerella genes were limited to developing seed, whereas the acyl-lipid metabolism database includes whole genome-wide acyl-lipid genes, we are able to detect total 615 lesquerella genes representing each sub acyl-lipid metabolism group (Table4). Two subgroups, Fatty acid synthesis and Triacylglycerol biosynthesis, of lesquerella genes had 29 and 59 members, respectively, which are very close to the numbers of 28 and 69 respectively of Arabidopsis genes obtained from a microarray study on genes expressed in seeds [59]. A total of 1,989 isotigs and singletons involved in acyl-lipid metabolism showing high sequence identity with Arabidopsis genes were identified. The average number of transcripts for each subgroup were: 8 in subgroup of triacylglycerol biosynthesis and 4 in subgroup of fatty acid synthesis. The rest of subgroups each had 2-3 average transcript numbers. The result indicates that our seed transcriptome is highly representative of transcripts for fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis. We conclude that our selection of developing seeds at 30 DAP was suitable for studying acyl-lipid metabolism in lesquerella.Table 4.

Genes involved in fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis are well-represented in the transcriptome. To understand hydroxy fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism in lesquerella, we further deeply mined the transcriptome assembly for genes involved in fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis. Using known Arabidopsis genes listed in the acyl-lipid metabolism database, we identified lesquerella orthologs for nearly all the genes involved in fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis; the number of isotigs for each gene varied from 1 to 58 (Table5, Figure3). Among 32 genes, 20 (63%) had a representative isotig encoding full length cDNA. The ones coding for partial cDNA sequences covered 23-97% of their full length sequences. Strikingly, we found a high percentage of sequence identity between Arabidopsis and lesquerella genes. Out of 32 genes, 20 had nucleotide identity at 90-99%, with an average identity overall of 90%. The remaining 12 had 80-89% identity (Table5). The very high sequence identity between Arabidopsis and lesquerella genes suggests a similar high degree of conservation of their functions in seeds that enables translational research and facilitates genetic engineering of lesquerella lines with desirable oil content and fatty acid composition.Table 5.

Fatty acid biosynthesis in plastids. We examined our collection of lesquerella transcripts for representatives of key genes encoding the known steps of fatty acid biosynthesis in plastids (Figure3). Fatty acid biosynthesis begins with the rate-limiting conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a heteromeric complex enzyme composed of 4 subunits: 1 beta-carboxyltransferase (beta-CT) encoded by the plastid genome and biotin carboxyl-carrier protein (BCCP), biotic carboxylase (BC), and alpha-carboxyltransferase (alpha-CT), each encoded by the nuclear genome. In the lesquerella transcriptome, transcripts encoding BCCP and alpha-CT subunits were identified with 10 isotigs and 17 isotigs, respectively (Table5). In Arabidopsis, two paralogous of BCCP genes, BCCP1 (At5g16390) and BCCP2 (At5g15530) were characterized with BCCP1 being the more highly expressed during embryo development [60]. In lesquerella seed, 7 isotigs of PfBCCP1 and 3 isotigs of PfBCCP2 were identified, and the longest, isotig19563 and isotig07553, shared 88% and 89% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively, to Arabidopsis homologous. We did not detect BC and beta-CT in the lesquerella seed transcriptome, which could be due to a low level of their transcripts in 30 DAP seeds. We detected lesquerella homologs of all five isoforms of plastid acyl-carrier proteins (ACP) reported in Arabidopsis (At3g05020, At1g54580, At1g54630, At4g25050, At5g27200) [61]. Among them, PfACP5 (6 isotigs), corresponding to At5g27200 isoform, was the mostly expressed (Table5). A gene encoding malonyl-CoA ACP transferase (MCMT) was also identified in lesquerella with 5 isotigs, and the longest isotig17972 showed 93% nucleotide sequence identify with its Arabidopsis MCMT homolog (At2g30200).. Fatty acid synthesis is continued by an acyl-chain specific condensing enzyme subunit (KASIII, I, and II), and the common component of 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (KAR), 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (HAD), and 2-enoyl-ACP reductase (ER) (Figure3). We tried to identify transcripts for three key fatty acid synthases, 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) III, I, II using Arabidopsis KASIII (At1g62640), KASI (At5g46290) and KASII (At1g74960) genes as queries, but only PfKASII was detected. It had 6 isotigs, and the longest, isotig15566, showed 91% identity with Arabidopsis seed homolog KASII [62]. The other two KAS transcripts are apparently missing or rare in the 30-day seed transcriptome. Based on Arabidopsis KAR (At1g24360), HAD (At5g10160), and ER (At2g05990), we detected PfKAR (5 isotigs) , PfHAD (9 isotigs) and PfER (4 isotigs) in lesquerella seed. Stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD) catalyzes the conversion of 18:0-ACP to 18:1-ACP in plastids (Figure3). Arabidopsis has seven SAD family genes including FAB2 (At2g43710) and DES5 (At1g02630); FAB2 is the most highly expressed [63]. Indeed the FAB2 plays a major role in the reaction [64]. In the seed transcriptome, lesquerella FAB2 homologues were detected with 6 isotigs; No homologous isotig was detected for DES5 (Table5, Figure3). Two fatty acid thioesteases, FatA (homologue of At3g25110) and FatB (homologue of At1g08510), were detected with 2 and 4 isotigs, respectively in lesquerella seed (Table5, Figure3). Long chain acyl-CoA synthase (LACS) is located the membrane of plastid outer envelopes and catalyzes addition of CoA to free fatty acids to produce the fatty acyl-CoAs utilized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Two Arabidopsis plastid-localized LACS9 (At1g77590) and ER-localized LACS8 (At2g04350) have been reported [65,66]. In the lesquerella seed transcriptome, 1 isotig of PfLACS8 and 2 isotigs of PfLACS9 were identified (Table5, Figure3).. . . Endoplasmic reticulum-associated fatty acid hydroxylase, desaturases and elongase. Seed oil of lesquerella contains 55-60% 20:1-OH, and two key genes, PfFHA12 and PfKSC18, directly responsible for synthesis of this unusual fatty acid have been previously identified [41,43]. In our seed transcriptome, we found 7 and 28 isotigs representing PfFAH12 and PfKCS18, respectively (Table5, Figure3). The detailed temporal expression patterns of PfFAH12 and PfKCS18 during lesquerella seed development were reported [5]. Both of the genes showed a bell-shaped expression pattern with a peak at 35 DAP. The increased expression of PfFAH12 and PfKCS18 coincided with the increased synthesis and accumulation of HFA-containing TAG during lesquerella seed development [52].. ER-associated microsomal oleoyl PC desaturase encoded by FAD2 is known to introduce a double bond at the 12 position of 18:1 on PC and convert it to linoleic acid (18:2) (Figure3). During the entire course of seed development, lesquerella accumulates 18:2 at 2.5-6.5mol% in TAG with an average of 4.8mol% in TAG [5]. The presence of a constant level of 18:2 in lesquerella seeds indicates that an oleate desaturease activity is maintained at a relatively steady level. In this study, transcripts of PfFAD2 desaturase were detected with 2 isotigs, fewer than those of PfFHA12 and PfKSC18. The results of temporal expression profile analysis indicated that PfFAD2 is expressed at a relatively constant level throughout most stages of seed development up to 42 DAP, but drops about 95% by the latest stage sampled, 49 DAP (Figure4A). The temporal expression pattern of PfFAD2 observed in this study is slightly different from that previously reported (LfFen1) [5], where a bell-shaped pattern of PfFAD2 expression was observed that peaked at 35 DAP and decreased at 42 and 49 DAP [5]. We noted in that study that the change of the expression level of PfFAD2 during seed development was moderately dynamic. In young seeds up to 21 DAP, the expression were already 36-48% of that of 28 DAP. During 28-35 DAP maturation stages, seeds boosted the expression only 2 to 4-fold [5]. The difference of PfFAD2 expression pattern at 42 DAP in the two studies could be due to variation in seed sample groups. Nonetheless, the constitutive or less dynamic temporal expression patterns of PfFAD2 indicated its house-keeping function for membrane lipid during seed development. Similar temporal patterns were found in some other house-keeping genes involved in seed oil biosynthesis in Arabidopsis [67] and castor [68]. In this study, we further characterized the expression profile of PfFAD2 in leaf, stem, root and flower bud tissues (Figure4A). We found that leaf had a level similar to that of developing seeds. The result is consistent with previously reported data of Northern blot analysis [43] or reverse transcription PCR [69]. However, a 4.4-fold higher expression of PfFAD2 in flower than leaf was observed (Figure4A). Since our flower buds contain about 26% pollen by weight, it is likely that PfFAD2 plays a key role in converting 18:1 to 18:2 to meet the demand of maintaining a basic level of 18:2 in lesquerella pollen. Similar results was reported for a safflower FAD2-10 that was expressed at a higher level in flower than cotyledon, hypocotyl, root, leaf and seed [70]. In addition, a FAD2 from Brassic napus was also found to be highly expressed in flower buds, and the expression was associated with membrane lipids and storage oil biosynthesis in pollen [71]. Recently, PfFAD2 has been shown to encode functional delta12 desaturase activity in transformed yeast [69]. Although the bi-functional enzyme encoded by the PfFAH12 gene also has some oleate 12-desaturase activity [43,45] that could convert some of the 18:1 to 18:2, we suggest that PfFAD2 plays an essential role in the desaturation of 18:1 in all cells and tissues.Figure 4.

Each data point represents the meanSD of three replicates.. Interestingly FAD3 transcripts were detected with the highest number (59 isotigs) among all genes involved in fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis (Table5). These FAD3 may catalyze PC-18:2 to PC-18:3 and/or PC-18:1-OH to PC-18:2-OH in lesquerella (Figure3). Result of amino acid alignment of the isotigs indicated that there are two FAD3 isoforms in lesquerella compared to single FAD3 gene in Arabidopsis (Figure5A, 5B). PfFAD3-1, represented by isotig17127, had 93-95% identity to Arabidopsis AtFAD3 and Brassica napus BnFAD3a, BnFAD3b, and BnFAD3c [71], indicating a common FAD3 in Brassicaceae plants. However, PfFAD3-2, represented by isotig00061, is an isoform diverged from all the above FAD3s, with only 78-81% identity to AtFAD3 and BnFDA3s (Figure5B). Isotig17127 and isotig00061 showed distinct N-terminal coding regions (Figure5A). Our expression profiling studies indicate that the expression of PfFAD3-1 progressively increased during seed development reaching a peak at 35 DAP, and then dropped sharply to undetectable levels at late stages 42 and 49 DAP (Figure5C). The induction between 14 DAP and 35 DAP was 33-fold. Moderate levels of expression were detected in leaf, stem and root. In flower bud, the expression was at about 6-fold higher than in seeds at 14 DAP (Figure5C). The temporal and spatial expression pattern of PfFAD3-2 is quite different from that of PfFAD3-1 (Figure5D). At early stages of seed development (14-21 DAP), the expression of PfFAD3-2 was high and then declined quickly when seeds progressed to mid- and late-stages. No expression was detected in leaf, stem, root and flower buds. In our seed transcriptome (30 DAP), many more PfFAD3-2 transcripts were detected (58 isotigs) than LfFAD3-1 (1 isotig) (Table5). This could be due to that the sample used for transcriptome study represented relatively young seeds. Based on the expression profiles of these two PfFAD3 genes, we suggest that both of them may contribute to the desaturation of FA in developing seeds, but PfFAD3-1 had a pattern similar to that of Arabidopsis (microarray data), and thus it may have a more general role in converting 18:2 to 18:3 in other organs. Since lesquerella seeds accumulate moderate amounts of 18:2-OH and 20:2-OH, the divergent and also seed-specific PfFAD3-2 isoform might have evolved to desaturate 18:1-OH and 20:1-OH. Further functional characterization of PfFAD3-1 and PfFAD3-2 needs to be carried out in order to determine their enzymatic activity and substrate specificity in acyl-lipid metabolism.Figure 5.

The conventional Kennedy pathway for TAG synthesis utilizes three acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferases, GPAT, LPAT and DGAT, that sequentially acylate the sn-1- and sn-2- and then sn-3-position of G3P with acyl-CoA (Figure3, red arrows). Since the synthesis of membrane glycerolipids also begins with sequential acylation of the sn-1- and sn-2- positions of G3P, GPAT and LPAT are common to synthesis of TAG and membrane glycerolipids. Using a bioinformatics approach, a new GPAT (At5g60620) was identified in Arabidopsis that exhibited extensive homology with a GPAT from mammalian cells involved in storage oil formation; that GPAT was postulated to be a putative AtGPAT9 for ER associated membrane and storage lipid biosynthesis in plants [72]. For the second acyl-CoA transferase, Arabidopsis LPAT2 (At3g57650) was found to be an ER-localized and involved in TAG and membrane lipid biosynthesis [73]. Using Arabidopsis genes (At5g60620 and At3g57650), we identified lesquerella orthologs of PfGPAT9 and PfLPAT2, each represented by 2 isotigs (Table5). Result of gene expression analysis indicated that both genes were expressed at a similar level in most samples examined, including leaf, stem, flower bud, and developing seeds from 14 DAP to 42 DAP, with the exception of PfLPAT2 levels in stem tissue, where expression was only about 50% that detected in leaf (Figure4B, 4C). Low levels of expression were detected in root and developing seeds at 49 DAP (Figure4B, 4C). Our spatial and temporal expression profiles of PfGPAT9 and PfLPAT2 were similar to those from Arabidopsis [59,73-75]. Based on the overall spatial and temporal expression profiles of PfGPAT9 and PfLPAT2, we suggest both genes playing essential housekeeping roles in membrane and storage lipid biosynthesis throughout plant life.. DGAT catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step of TAG biosynthesis (Figure3). There are three sequence-unrelated classes of DGATs reported in plants: membrane bound DGAT1 and DGAT2, and cytosolic DGAT3 (review) [76]. Using Arabidopsis DGAT1 (At2g19450), DGAT2 (At3g51520), and DGAT3 (At1g48300) as queries, seven lesquerella orthologs were identified in the seed transcriptome (Table5). Phylogenic analysis among DGAT genes from lesquerella, Arabidopsis, castor bean and peanut shows that the membrane type 1 (DGAT1), type 2 (DGAT2) and type 3 (DGAT3) are divided into three different clades (Figure6A). The result of amino acid alignment of the isotigs indicates that there are two PfDGAT1 isoforms in lesquerella compared to single DGAT1 gene in Arabidopsis (Figure6A, Additional file 1: Figure S1). Isotig11156 and isotig11157 had overall similarities in nucleotide and amino acid (AA) sequences (Table5), but the first 100 AA at the N-termini show 45% divergence for isotig11156 and 53% for isotig11157 (Additional file 1: Figure S1). We designate the isoform encoded by isotig11157 as PfDGAT1-1 and that encoded by isotig11156 as PfDGAT1-2. Lesquerella DGAT2 is more related to the DGAT2 from Arabidopsis than to that from castor (Figure6A). Protein sequence alignment revealed that castor DGAT2 has additional 25 AA at its N-terminus (Additional file 1: Figure S2). Soluble DGAT3 is divided into a distinct clade in the phylogeny tree from DGAT1 and DGAT2 due to sequence distance (Figure6A). PfDGAT3 encodes a longer protein (360 AA) compared with those of 285, 332, and 345 AA of Arabidopsis, castor bean, and peanut DGAT3, respectively (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Protein sequence analysis showed that PfDGAT3 had 82% identity with AtDGAT3, even though it has 75 more AA (Additional file 1: Figure S3).Figure 6. Characterization of three types. PfDGATs. . (A) Phylogenetic tree showing relationships among DGAT1, DGAT2, and DGAT3 from Physaria fendleri (Pf), Arabidopsis (At), Brassica napus (Bn), castor bean (Rc), peanut (Ah).

The tree was constructed as described in Figure5B. (B-E) Expression of PfDGAT1-1, PfDGAT1-2, PfDGAT2, and PfDGAT3 in developing seeds and major organs determined by qPCR. Abbreviated names for the genes are described in Figure3. Each data point represents the meanSD of three replicates.. It is general accepted that depending on the plant species, DGAT1 or DGAT2 is a major enzyme responsible for the accumulation of seed TAG [76]. DGAT3 was recently demonstrated to be active in recycling of 18:2 and 18:3 FAs into TAG through a cytosolic pathway in peanut [77]. Our results of gene expression analysis showed that PfDGAT1-1 and PfDGAT1-2 had distinct expression patterns. PfDGAT1-1 was expressed in all stages during seed development and in leaf, stem, and flower bud, but it was expressed more in leaf, stem, and in immature seeds prior to active oil biosynthesis and became a predominant DGAT mRNA at late-maturation/desiccation stages (42-49 DAP) (Figure6B). In contrast, PfDGAT1-2 had expression levels higher in developing seeds than in other tissues such as leaf, stem, root and flower buds (Figure6C). PfDGAT1-2 may specifically contribute to TAG synthesis in seed. Indeed, our PfDGAT1-2 is the same gene as PfDGAT1a identified in a lesquerella seed cDNA library [78] and found to complement the Arabidopsis AS11 mutant [79]. AS11 had reduced DGAT activity and seed oil content due to a deletion in AtDGAT1 gene [79-81]. Seed-specific over-expression of an Arabidopsis cDNA encoding AtDGAT1 not only restored the oil content in AS11 but also enhanced seed oil content and seed weight in wild-type plants [82]. The expression profile of PfDGAT2 was overall similar to that of PfDGAT1-1, except in the late-maturation/desiccation stages where PfDGAT2 expression dropped to undetectable levels or trace amounts (42 and 49 DAP, respectively) (Figure6D). The results indicate that both PfDGAT1-1 and PfDGAT2 may function in other physiological processes besides seed oil synthesis, and that they clearly contribute differently in lipid metabolism during late-maturation/desiccation stages of seed development. PfDGAT3 was ubiquitously expressed in all samples and showed a moderate dynamic pattern compared with the other PfDGATs. In leaf, stem, flower bud, and developing seeds at early stages (14-21 DAP), PfDGAT3 transcripts were detected at levels similar to that of PfDGAT1-1 (Figure6B, 6E). In developing seeds at 35 DAP, their levels rose 2- to 4-fold before declining steadily at late stages 42-49 DAP (Figure6B, 6E). The boosted expression of PfDGAT3 may be associated with increasing demands of membrane and storage lipids synthesis at 35 DAP, when seeds had attained their maximum size and storage compounds have accumulated to a high plateau [52]. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of PfDGAT3 suggests its role of house-keeping in most organs of lesquerella. Similar expression profile was reported for DGAT3 in peanut [83], Arbidopsis [75] and tung tree [84]. None of these DGAT3s were hypothesized to play a significant role in seed oil synthesis; rather it was proposed that they are involved in general TAG metabolism. Among all samples, root tissue had the lowest number of transcripts of all PfDGATs. While it is clear that PfDGAT1-2 plays a role in seed TAG assembly, it remains an open question as to whether or not PfDGAT1-1, PfDGAT2 or PfDGAT3 also contribute. Measurements of enzyme activity and substrate specificity in various tissues are needed to better elucidate the functions of the different PfDGATs. The results of such studies combined with our sequence characterization and expression profiling will provide the molecular basis for future identification of PfDGAT candidates for genetic engineering oilseeds for hydroxy fatty acid production.. . . PC-mediated TAG synthesis. As described, PC is the substrate for many FA-modifying enzymes (desaturase, hydroxylase, etc.). The FA fluxes into and out of PC are crucial for the production of TAG esterified with modified FAs, such as HFA. Based on current knowledge, there are three routes allowing PC-derived FA to be incorporated into TAG. First, The FA esterified to PC undergoes constant deacylation and reacylation by LPCAT in so called acyl editing [27]. Thus modified FA released by LPCAT can enter Kennedy pathway for TAG assembly (Figure3, orange arrows). Second, direct transfer by PDAT of a FA from the sn-2 position of PC to the sn-3 position of DAG produces TAG (Figure3, green arrows). Third, PDCT catalyzes the inter-conversion between DAG and PC by phosphocholine head group exchange (Figure3, blue arrows). Thus FA on PC can be incorporated into the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of TAG by the PC derived DAG.. Recent studies have revealed the roles of the enzymes encoded by Arabidopsis LPCAT1 (At1g12640) and LPCAT2 (At1g63050) and other plant LPCATs genes [85-88]. They suggest that LPCATs are responsible for incorporation of newly synthesized fatty acid into PC (forward reaction), and transferring polyunsaturated and HFAs produced on PC directly to the acyl-CoA pool (reverse reaction) for further metabolism or catabolism. When reverse reactions were measured, a ricinoleoyl group at the sn-2 position of PC was removed 3- to 6-fold faster than an oleoyl group by seven LPCATs from five species tested, including a PfLPCAT2 [88]. These results suggest an important role for PfLPCATs in removing 18:1-OH from sn-2 PC to an acyl-CoA pool. The mechanism of PC-modified UFAs channeled into TAG through efficient acyl editing and Kennedy pathway has been proposed as one of the major mechanisms that allow efficient assembling of UFA into TAGs [32]. As lesquerella TAGs contains 55-60% 20:1-OH, it is likely that the acyl editing by PfLPCATs allows 18:1-OH to be immediately released from PC, activated to 18:1-OH-CoA then elongated to 20:1-OH-CoA for further incorporation into TAG through the Kennedy pathway. When temporal and spatial expression patterns of Arabidopsis LPCATs were investigated using promoter fragments of AtLPCATs fused with the uidA reporter gene encoding -glucuronidase (GUS), differential expression patterns were observed for AtLPCAT1 and AtLPCAT2 [87]. Histochemical localization of GUS activity in transgenic lines showed that both promoters were active in seedling and rosette leaves. During seed development, AtLPCAT1 promoter activity was detected at a later developmental stage, whereas AtLPCAT2 promoter was active throughout seed development; it was also particularly strong in pollen grains. We have identified ten isotigs of PfLPCAT1 and one isotig of PfLPCAT2 in the lesquerella seed transcriptome, and found high sequence identity between lesquerella and Arabidopsis LPCATs (Table5, Figure7A). Our expression profiling data indicate that PfLPACTs are also differentially expressed (Figure7B, 7C). During seed development, PfLPCAT1 showed a linear-rise throughout most stages up to 42 DAP, and then a sharp drop at 49 DAP when seeds enter the desiccation stage. The PfLPCAT1 temporal pattern resembles AtLPCAT1. Little expression of PfLPCAT1 was detected in leaf, stem, root and flower bud (Figure7B). Unlike PfLPCAT1, PfLPCAT2 showed high expression during early (14-21) DAP stages of seed development, medium-high levels from 28-35 DAP, and then suddenly became undetectable and extremely low at late stages 42 and 49 DAP, respectively (Figure7C). In leaf, stem and root, moderate expression of PfLPCAT2 was detected (Figure7C). In flower bud, PfLPCAT2 was expressed highest among all organs investigated. (Figure7C). The overall expression profile of PfLPCAT2 is similar to that of AtLPCAT2 based on promoter activity analysis [83] and information available at the Arabidopsis eFP browser [75]. Our results revealed that both PfLPCATs were expressed during seed development but with opposite trends. Thus, it is likely that both PfLPCATs contribute to TAG metabolism in lesquerella seeds. PfLPCAT2 was highly expressed in flower bud, suggesting its involvement in TAG synthesis in pollen.Figure 7. Characterization of two. PfLPCATs.. (A) Phylogenetic tree showing relationships among LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 from Physaria fendleri (Pf), Arabidopsis (At), Bernardia pulchella (Bp), castor bean (Rc), Hiptage benghalensis (Hb), Momordica charantia (Mc), Carthamus tinctorius (Ct).

The tree was constructed as described in Figure5B. (B, C) Expression of PfLPCAT1 and PfLPCAT2 in developing seeds and major organs determined by qPCR. Abbreviated names for the genes are described in Figure3. Each data point represents the meanSD of three replicates.. PDAT was identified and characterized as an acyl-CoA-independent transacylase that transfers the fatty acid at the sn-2 position in PC to the sn-3 position of DAG, thus synthesizing TAG [37]. Two PDATs were found from Arabidopsis, PDAT1 (At5g13640) and PDAT2 (At3g44830) [89]. AtPDAT1 is ubiquitously expressed [75,90], but AtPDAT2 transcripts are predominantly found in seed [75]. Together with AtDGAT1, AtPDAT1 has been shown to determine the amount of TAG synthesis in pollen grains and developing seeds, whereas AtPDAT2 does not play a substantial role in TAG synthesis, although it is highly expressed during seed development [91]. Based on homology searches with Arabidopsis PDATs, we identified a total of 28 isotigs of PfPDAT transcripts in the lesquerella seed transcriptome. Detailed comparison among 28 isotigs led to discovery of PfPDAT1-1, PfPDAT1-2, and PfPDAT2 (Table5). PfPDAT1-2 is slightly closer to AtPDAT1 than PfPDAT1-1 (Table5, Figure8A). Sequence alignments revealed that the 3-UTRs of PfPDAT1-1 and PfPDAT1-2 were distinct (Additional file 1: Figure S4). Gene expression analysis revealed that PfPDAT1-1 was ubiquitously expressed in developing seeds at all stages and in other organs examined (Figure8B), similar to the expression pattern of AtPDAT1. Expression levels of PfPDAT1-2 were about 100-fold higher in developing seeds compared with PfPDAT1-1, but were negligible in leaf, stem and root (Figure8C). In flower bud, both PfPDAT1-1 and PfPDAT1-2 isoforms were highly expressed at equivalent (Figure8B, 8C). The temporal expression of PfPDAT2 showed an linear rise during seed development up to 42 DAP, and then a drop to a low level at the latest stage 49 DAP. The highest level at 42 DAP is comparable to that of PfPDAT1-2. In leaf, stem, root and flower bud, the expression level of PfPDAT2 was negligible (Figure8D). The role of PDAT in HFAs synthesis has been well studied in castor by two groups [50,51], who both found that castor PDATs were comprised of three members, RcPDAT1-1 [51] (same as RcPDAT1B [50]), RcPDAT1-2 [51] (same as RcPDAT1A [50]) and RcPDAT2. Gene expression analysis indicated that RcPDAT1-1/RcPDAT1B and RcPDAT2 had profiles similar to those of AtPDAT1 and AtPDAT2, respectively, [50,51]. However, RcPDAT1-2/RcPDAT1A was highly expressed in developing castor seeds, and this isoform was not found in Arabidopsis. Since castor accumulates 90% HFA in seed TAG, it has been proposed that the enzyme encoded by RcPDAT1-2/RcPDAT1A could be important for HFA-TAG synthesis. Indeed both groups demonstrated that RcPDAT1-2/RcPDAT1A facilitated the transfer of HFAs from PC into TAG in transgenic Arabidopsis. Unlike castor oil which has over 70% of TAGs esterified with 18:1-OH in all three positions [92], lesquerella TAGs contain 55-60% 20:1-OH, and majority of them are esterified in sn-1 and sn-3 positions [3]. The lack of HFA at the sn-2 of TAG could be explained by LPATs in lesquerella discriminating 20:1-OH substrate. Recent studies of transgenic Camelina expressing RcFAH12 and PfKCS3 suggested the mechanism of 20:1-OH in TAG assembly mainly utilizing Kennedy pathway in lesquerella [93]. Therefore, PfPDATs are unlikely major enzymes channeling HFA into TAGs. The roles of PfPDATs remain to be determined. The gene sequence and expression profile of PfPDATs identified in this study provide critical information for future investigation on the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity in acyl-lipid metabolism in lesquerella.Figure 8.

The tree was constructed as described in Figure5B. (B-D) Expression of PfPDAT1-1, PfPDAT1-2, and PfPDAT2 in developing seeds and major organs determined by qPCR.Abbreviated names for the genes are described in Figure3. Each data point represents the meanSD of three replicates.. Fatty acids at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions in PC can be directly transferred to TAG through DAG converted by PDCT. The PDCT enzyme, encoded in Arabidopsis by the Reduced Oleate Desaturation1 (ROD1) gene, catalyzes the inter-conversion between DAG and PC by phosphocholine head group exchange [36]. In castor, the 18:1-OH is produced by the hydroxylation of 18:1 that is esterified to the sn-2 position of PC [39]. Since PDCT catalyzes the shuffling of acyl groups between PC and DAG, it provides a mechanism of making HFA-DAG from HFA-PC, thus the HFA-DAG can be subsequently converted to HFA-TAG. A castor PDCT enzyme gene was isolated and co-expressed in a transgenic Arabidopsis line carrying RcFAH12. The doubly transformed line had increases of 17-23% in seed HFA content [35]. The authors noted that co-expression of AtPDCT did not increase HFA in transgenic Arabidopsis, indicating that RcPDCT had evolved to effectively convert HFA-PC to HFA-DAG [35]. In the lesquerella seed transcriptome, we have identified one isotig25038 showing high homology with Arabidopsis PDCT and have designated it PfPDCT. The PfPDCT sequence shares 89% and 73% identify with AtPDCT and RcPDCT, respectively (Additional file 1: Figure S5). Gene expression analysis indicated that PfPDCT is expressed ubiquitously in developing seeds and other organs examined (Figure4D). Among most samples, the expression levels ranged from 100-243 relative copy number, with exception of the seed sample at 42 DAP and the root sample, which had levels of about 365 and 11, respectively. A similar expression profile for AtPDCT was reported [36]. It is known that the sn-2 position of TAG in lesquerella consists almost all of C18 unsaturated acyl groups including 18:1, 18:2 and 18:3 [3]. Thus PfPDCT would not be a major enzyme involved in channeling HFA into lesquerella TAGs. It is possible that PfPDCT contributes FA flux through PC-derived DAG in TAG assembly in lesquerella. However, based on the expression profile of PfPDCT, it is likely that PfPDCT plays a general house-keeping function in lesquerella acyl-lipid metabolism..
PMC4861841	Results. . Cloning and Sequence Analysis of TaB2. Through northern analysis, the expression of putative B2 protein encoding gene transcript was found to be highly expressed at 42C (Chauhan et al., 2011). The full length cDNA of 1,396 bp (Figure 1A) was obtained by comparison of the sequence of the initial clone and the RACE products harboring 933 bp ORF with 128 bp of 5 UTR and 335 bp of 3 UTR encoding 310 deduced amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 35.62 kDa and a predicted isoelectric point of 8.35. The protein sequence of TaB2 contains development and cell DCD from position 175 to 307 amino acid residues analyzed by SMART (Smart Modular Architecture Research Tool) database (Figure 1B). This DCD domain is found particularly in plant proteins involved in development and cell death. A neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree was constructed in Mega (version 6) software using ORF sequences of putative B2 protein (Figure 1C). It was evident from the tree that the putative TaB2 cloned in the present study formed a tight group with other monocots and closely related to H. vulgare whereas dicot species sharing same DCD domain clustered altogether in a different clade. Multiple sequence alignment analysis using deduced amino acid from BLASTp in NCBI database revealed that putative B2 protein showed high similarity of 99% with H. vulgare predicted protein which is not yet annotated (Supplementary Figure S1). A high sequence similarity was also found with other monocots like B. distachyon, Z. mays, O. brachyantha, however, when compared with dicots, A. thaliana, B2 protein showed only 59% similarity with T. aestivum B2 protein.. .

The Confocal microscopy of transformed onion epidermal cells revealed thatTaB2-GFP fusion protein localized in nucleus and cytoplasm.

The chimeric protein (pSITE-2CA:TaB2) was localized to the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm while in control (pSITE-2CA), GFP localized throughout the cell.. . . . . . Expression Analysis of TaB2 at Major Developmental Stages and in Response to Abiotic Stress. The expression profile of TaB2 was analyzed in 35 different combination of tissues under various abiotic stress treatments along with some growth effectors at major developmental stages of wheat (Figures 3A,B). Interestingly, in vegetative tissues TaB2 showed higher expression during high temperature stress at 42C in both root and shoot. It also displayed upregulation to exogenous ABA treatment suggesting that TaB2 may be regulated via an ABA-mediated signaling pathway. However, comparatively low level of expression were observed in seedling tissues when induced by BR, SA, CaCl2, NaCl, drought, and cold. Differential expression analysis was also observed at major developmental stages of wheat where TaB2 displayed moderate expression (fold change 3) specifically in high temperature stressed (42C) anther tissue as compared to the spike and ovary. However, TaB2 is highly inducible by high temperatures in developing seeds especially in 15 DAA seed stage followed by 20 DAA.. . FIGURE 3. . Expression analysis of TaB2.

To elucidate the role of putative TaB2 protein in plant development and abiotic stress, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaB2 under the control of CaMV 35S promoter were raised. The transgenic nature of putative transformants of TaB2 in Arabidopsis was confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Figure S2). The transcript level of transgenic lines B2.3, B2.4, and B2.7 showed higher expression than B2.5 and B2.9 whereas no detectable expression monitored in wild-type (Figure 4). Therefore, on the basis of transcript level three transgenic lines (B2.3, B2.4, and B2.7) of Arabidopsis were selected for further morphological and phenotypic analysis in T4 generation. Also, we selected T-DNA insertion mutant SALK lines of Arabidopsis putative B2 protein coding gene from TAIR database SALK_044868 and SALK_041306. As a result of PCR, from SALK_044868, mutant line deltaM1.12 and SALK_041306 mutant line deltaM2.6 was selected for further transgenic analysis (Supplementary Figure S3).. . FIGURE 4. .

To compare the phenotypic traits among WT, deltab2, TaB2-OE and Cdeltab2 plants, we examined the morphometric details. The deltab2 plant viz. deltaM1.12 showed stunted growth as compared to the Cdeltab2 plant (deltaM1.12:TaB2) which were found to be phenotypically identical to wild-type. However, overexpression transgenic plants of TaB2 showed faster germination and exhibited more developed inflorescence and better silique formation (Figure 5). The mutant deltaM1.12 plants showed short plant height, reduced rosette diameter, lesser rosette leaf number, reduced leaf length and width, reduced and smaller number of siliques per plant (Table 1). The stunted growth of deltab2 plant was rescued by Cdeltab2 plant, which implies the importance of TaB2 in development. The TaB2-OE plants were characterized by increased plant height, rosette diameter, rosette leaf number, enlarged leaf length, leaf width, silique length, and more number of siliques per plant with significant difference as compared to the WT and Cdeltab2 plants, respectively.. .

Expression Profile of TaB2 Overexpression in Arabidopsis. The expression behavior of WT, deltab2, Cdeltab2, and TaB2-OE encoding gene transgenics, was undertaken by real time PCR in different tissues viz. leaf, flower, developing and mature siliques under control and high temperature stressed conditions. We observed that in leaf and flower tissues the relative fold-change of expression was not significantly increased at high temperature as compared to the non-stressed Arabidopsis plants (Figures 6A,B), however, the expression of TaB2 transgenic line was upregulated in developing and mature siliques under high temperature stress, as compared to the control conditions (Figure 6C). Further in deltab2 lines, negligible expression was observed in all the Arabidopsis tissues under non-stressed and heat stress conditions whereas no significant difference was observed in the expression level of Cdeltab2 lines with respect to the WT. Thus the above analysis indicates that TaB2 functions during both seed development and high temperature stress response.. . FIGURE 6. . Quantitative RT-PCR was done in different tissues viz.

The 5-day-old TaB2 transgenic and Cdeltab2 seedlings displayed significantly longer hypocotyl when compared with the WT and deltab2 seedlings grown under normal temperature conditions (Figure 7A). However, under high temperature stress conditions the hypocotyl length decreases in WT, transgenic, deltab2 and Cdeltab2 lines. Both mutant lines deltaM1.12 and deltaM2.6 failed to show hypocotyl elongation under normal and high temperatures while Cdeltab2 lines rescued this phenotype. The hypocotyl length was then measured, plotted and photographed (Figure 7B).. . FIGURE 7. .

Overexpression of TaB2 Enhanced Tolerance to Altered Temperature Stress. We checked the response of overexpression transgenic lines, deltab2, Cdeltab2, and WT plants under high and low temperature stress conditions. In root growth assays, the transgenic and Cdeltab2 lines had much elongated roots as compared to the WT and deltab2 seedlings at high and low temperatures while there is no significant difference observed in root length under control conditions except in the deltab2 plants where the extent of retardation in root length was higher (Figures 8A,B). We observed increased plant height and larger rosette diameter of transgenic as compared to the deltab2 and WT under high and low temperature stress conditions whereas under non-stressed condition no significant difference was found except in the deltab2 seedlings where it decreases markedly (Figures 8C,D). Also, the rosette leaves in Arabidopsis plants under high temperature stress remained green in transgenic lines as compared to the WT, however, under low temperature stress conditions no phenotypic difference displayed relative to the rosettes between transgenics and WT.. .

Values plotted arc mean for 10 seedlings each and data represents are mean  SD from three independent replicates. Asterisks marked above bars indicate statistically significant differences (P  0.05, P  0.01).. . . . The tolerance to high and low temperature stress was further confirmed on the basis of physiological experiments of transgenic Arabidopsis plants analyzed quantitatively by measuring chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, and membrane stability index. The TaB2-OE transgenic and Cdeltab2 plants both under high and low temperature stress conditions showed higher chlorophyll content as compared to the WT plants. Interestingly, in deltab2 plants the extent of depletion in chlorophyll content was higher. Similar trend was also observed under non- stressed condition but the total chlorophyll content was relatively higher in all the different Arabidopsis plants as compared to the stressed condition (Figure 9A). The ability of transgenic plants to tolerate high temperatures was also checked by measuring the photosynthetic yield (Fv/Fm) of PSII which displayed higher value of Fv/Fm in overexpressing plants as compared to the WT and Cdeltab2 plants. The deltab2 plants exhibited reduction in PSII activity while minor differences observed between control and low temperature stress conditions (Figure 9B). Further, membrane stability index analysis was undertaken to assess stress tolerance which depicted that membranes of TaB2-OE plants showed higher stability under high and low temperature stress as compared to the WT and Cdeltab2 plants whereas deltab2 plants demonstrated drastic reduction in percentage of membrane stability index (Figure 9C). Thus, by monitoring the above physiological parameters, it is confirmed the ability of TaB2-OE transgenics to tolerate adverse temperature conditions efficiently.. . FIGURE 9. .

Data represents from three independent replicates and are mean  SD. Asterisks marked above bars indicate statistically significant differences (P  0.05, P  0.01).. . . . . . Lipid Peroxidation and In Situ Accumulation of Superoxide Radicals. Lipid peroxidation was represented by estimating the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) level under heat stress conditions (Hameed et al., 2012). Heat stress significantly enhanced membrane deterioration as reflected by increased MDA content among all the Arabidopsis lines (Figure 10A). The MDA content between WT, deltab2, transgenic and Cdeltab2 lines did not differ significantly under control temperature conditions, but when exposed to high temperature conditions the MDA levels in deltab2 plants increased, as compared to the TaB2-OE transgenic plants. Thus, the Arabidopsis plants transformed with TaB2 showed better resistance to heat stress. To determine the effective role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in heat stress tolerance, we measured the superoxide (O2-) levels. The leaves of WT and deltab2 plants showed higher accumulation of O2- under heat stress (Figure 10B) relative to that under control conditions. However, leaves of transgenic and Cdeltab2 plants partially stained with NBT which implies lower accumulation of O2- during high temperature stress conditions, suggesting that the tolerance level of transgenic lines was better under heat stress.. . FIGURE 10. . Effect of HT stress on lipid peroxidation and superoxide levels in different Arabidopsis plants.

(B) 2-week-old Arabidopsis leaf samples were stained for accumulation of O2- by NBT staining after 2 h of heat stress treatment at 40C. Photographs were taken in stereo microscope Leica DFC 290 HD. Asterisks marked above bars indicate statistically significant differences (P  0.05, P  0.01).. . . . . . Overexpression of TaB2 in Arabidopsis Renders the Plant Hypersensitive to ABA. To check the response of TaB2 Arabidopsis transgenic plants in presence of the stress hormone ABA, both germination and root growth inhibition assays were performed at different concentrations of ABA and compared amongst transgenic lines and WT along with the deltab2 and its Cdeltab2 lines. TaB2-OE seeds were found to be hypersensitive to ABA whereas seeds of deltab2 lines were more tolerant than the WT and Cdeltab2 lines even at higher concentration (2 muM) of ABA (Figure 11A). The difference in percent germination of overexpression lines was drastically reduced at higher concentration of ABA whereas, deltab2 seeds maintained the germination potential (Figure 11C). In addition, root growth inhibition assay was also performed and Arabidopsis seedlings were vertically grown on half-strength MS medium plates supplemented with 0.5, 1, and 2 muM ABA grown for 4 days and analyzed. The data presented in (Figures 11B,D) displays that TaB2-OE seedlings were oversensitive to ABA and with increasing concentration root growth inhibited drastically. The WT and Cdeltab2 lines maintained normal root growth at lower concentration of ABA while showed inhibition at higher concentration as compared to the deltab2 lines. These observations thus suggest hypersensitivity of TaB2-OE transgenic Arabidopsis plants toward stress hormone ABA.. . FIGURE 11. . Sensitivity of ABA on overexpression TaB2 transgenic plant.

PMC4036515	Results. . Ectopic expression of BRP4 has a pleiotropic effect on organ development. We initially isolated a dominant mutant, smo3-D, from a transgenic Arabidopsis population harbouring the T-DNA activation-tagging plasmid pSKI015 (Weigel et al., 2000). The most striking phenotype of smo3-D plants was the small size of their aerial organs (Fig. 1A). Compared with that of WT, the size of leaves, inflorescences, and siliques in the smo3-D plants was obviously reduced (Fig. 1B-D). Genetic analysis of a backcrossed F2 progeny indicated that the segregation ratio of mutant:WT was 83:28 (3:1, P=0.96, chi2 test), in which all of the mutant phenotypes co-segregated with a T-DNA insertion event. These results suggested that smo3-D is a single-gene dominant mutant that may be caused by a T-DNA insertion. To identify the gene responsible for the smo3-D phenotype, we amplified the genomic sequence flanking the T-DNA by thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR (Liu et al., 1995), and found that a T-DNA segment was inserted between At3g57380 and At3g57370 (BRP4), 1014bp upstream of the start codon of BRP4 (Fig. 1E). RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of BRP4 was highly upregulated in smo3-D plants (Fig. 1F). To examine whether the ectopic expression of BRP4 was responsible for the small aerial organ phenotype in smo3-D, we introduced a pro35S:BRP4 construct into WT plants and introduced a pro35S:antiBRP4 construct into smo3-D plants. As shown in Fig. 1G, transgenic plants overexpressing BRP4 also showed the small aerial organ phenotype observed in smo3-D, while introduction of the pro35S:antiBRP4 construct fully restored smo3-D to WT morphology. These results indicated that the small aerial organ phenotype in smo3-D results from the elevated expression of BRP4, and that the ectopic expression of BRP4 has a pleiotropic effect on organ development.. .

The coding regions of both At3g57370 (BRP4) and At3g57380 are indicated as black arrows, and the intermediate genomic sequence is indicated as a black line.

(G) Morphology of 3-week-old transgenic pro35S:BRP4 plants and smo3-D carrying a pro35S:antiBRP4 construct. Bar, 1cm.. . . . . . BRP4 is a TFIIB-related protein. BLAST searching in the TAIR database showed that the amino acid sequence of BRP4 was highly similar to that of BRP2 (At3g29380), TFIIB1 (At2g41630), and TFIIB2 (At3g10330), all of which belong to the TFIIB family. Alignment indicated that these four proteins shared a conserved zinc ribbon domain and a C-terminal domain with two cyclin folds (Supplementary Fig. S1A at JXB online). However, compared with the other three TFIIB members, BRP4 had longer B-finger and B-linker domains (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In Arabidopsis, there are 14 TFIIB-like proteins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TFIIB1, TFIIB2, BRP2, BRP4, BRP6, and BRP3 were clustered into a clade, although BRP4 appeared to be far from the other five members (Knutson, 2013; Niu et al., 2013) (Supplementary Fig. S1B). To test for the possibility of functional redundancy among these TFIIB family members, we overexpressed TFIIB1, TFIIB2, and BRP2 in Arabidopsis. Compared with the small aerial organs observed in the transgenic plants overexpressing BRP4, no morphological phenotypes were observed in transgenic plants overexpressing TFIIB1, TFIIB2, or BRP2 (Supplementary Fig. S1C, D), suggesting that BRP4 might have a unique function in plant development.. . . . BRP4 is predominately expressed during the development of male gametophytes. To explore the role of BRP4 in plant development, we initially examined the organ-specific expression of BRP4 with RT-PCR analysis and found that BRP4 transcripts were detected only in the inflorescences and flower buds (Fig. 2A). We then generated transgenic plants carrying a proBRP4:GUS construct, and GUS staining assays showed that BRP4 expression was expressed predominately in developing anthers and mature pollen (Supplementary Fig. S2A, B, at JXB online). These observations were consistent with the expression profiles of BRP4 revealed by the microarray data in the TAIR database (Supplementary Fig. S2C, D). To define the stage-specific expression of BRP4, we carried out qRT-PCR analysis with anthers at various developmental stages, and found that BRP4 was expressed primarily from anther development stages 5-9 (Fig. 2B), during which time the pollen mother cells are undergoing meiosis to produce tetrads and the microspores are then released (Sanders et al., 1999; Ma et al., 2012). Further RNA in situ hybridization verified that mRNA of BRP4 was initially detected at anther development stage 6, when pollen mother cells were undergoing meiotic division (Fig. 2C, D), and that BRP4 mRNA accumulation reached a peak level in the tetrads at anther development stage 7. BRP4 mRNA was also detectable in microspores at stage 8 (Fig. 2E, F). However, no BRP4 mRNA was detected in anthers after stage 9 (Fig. 2G-J). BRP4 mRNA was also detected in tapetum from anther development stages 5-8 (Fig. 2D-F). These findings strongly suggested that BRP4 may function during male gametophyte development. Additionally, we examined the cellular localization of BRP4 with pro35S:BRP4-GFP transgenic plants, which again showed the small aerial organ phenotype of pro35S:BRP4 plants (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) uorescence of the BRP4-GFP fusion protein in both root and petal epidermal cells showed that BRP4 was localized to the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S2F, G).. .

RNA in situ hybridization was performed with anthers at stage 5 (C), stage 6 (D), stage 7 (E), stage 8 (F), stage 9 (G), stage 11 (H), and stage 12 (I). The anther at stage 7 hybridized with a BRP4 sense probe is shown as an example negative control (J). Bars, 20 m.. . . . . . Knockdown of BRP4 expression results in pollen developmental defects. As no knockdown or knockout mutant of BRP4 in Arabidopsis is publically available, we used an RNAi approach to investigate the biological function of BRP4. A native promoter-driven BRP4 RNAi construct (proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi) was generated with a 157bp cDNA fragment specific for BRP4 and introduced into Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. S3A at JXB online). All of the transgenic plants from the 34 independent proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi lines we obtained developed normally in their organ morphology. However, 18 lines displayed a pollen abortion phenotype, with varied percentages of shrunken pollen (Fig. 3A, B). Further analysis of mature pollen in the T3 plants using Alexander staining confirmed the different percentages of abnormal pollen (Fig. 3C, D). Of the four independent lines that were examined closely, L7 produced about 48.64% shrunken pollen, while the percentages of shrunken pollen in L3, L10, and L9 were 34.75, 20.39, and 2.94%, respectively (Fig. 3C-E). qRT-PCR analysis showed that the variations of the aborted pollen phenotype were closely correlated to the reduced BRP4 expression levels in these lines (Fig. 3E, F). Expression of other TFIIB genes closely homologous to BRP4 was not obviously altered in these proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi lines (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These results suggested that the pollen development phenotype in these transgenic plants resulted from the knockdown of BRP4 expression. In addition, these transgenic plants also exhibited reproductive abnormalities. Compared with WT plants, which produced only 1.04% undeveloped ovules or seeds in siliques, the transgenic lines L7, L3, L10, and L9 had 40.62, 10.06, 3.87, and 1.22% aborted ovules or seeds, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3C), demonstrating that knockdown of BRP4 expression also affects plant fertility.. . Fig. 3.. . Knockdown of BRP4 expression causes an aborted pollen phenotype. (A, B) Morphology of mature pollen from WT (A) and transgenic proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi L7 plants (B). (C, D) Alexander staining of pollen from WT (C) and L7 (D) plants. Bar, 20 m. (E) Percentage of the shrunken pollen in WT and four independent T3 transgenic proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi lines (L3, L7, L9, and L10). (F) qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of BRP4 in WT and proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi lines as described in (E). The data are from three biological replicates and are presented as meansSD (Students t-test, **P<0.01).. . . . To further verify whether or not the stage-specific knockdown of BRP4 expression was responsible for the pollen defects in the proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi transgenic plants, we also generated transgenic plants carrying a proACT11:BRP4 RNAi construct (Supplementary Fig. S3A at JXB online). ACT11 was expressed in young pistils from anther development stages 9-12, and was also strongly expressed in mature pollen (Huang et al., 1997). Among the 18 transgenic lines we obtained, no pollen developmental defects were observed, although a decrease in BRP4 expression was detected in the inflorescences of these transgenic plants (Supplementary Fig. S3D-F). This observation further supported the assertion that the expression of BRP4 in developing anthers is required for proper pollen development.. . . . BRP4 affects the progression of male gametophyte mitosis. To explore the role of BRP4 during male gametogenesis, we carefully compared the microspore formation and development of WT and T3 proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi transgenic plants. At the tetrad and microspore stages, the male gametophytes appeared to be morphologically normal in both genotypes (Fig. 4A, B). However, a striking difference between the two genotypes was observed starting from the bicellular stage. At this stage, 99.56% of the microspores in the WT had two cells, in which the small generative cell had an intense fluorescent signal but the large vegetative cell had a faint signal (Fig. 4A, C). However, 39.15 and 29.29% of the microspores had only one cell with faint fluorescence in the proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi L7 and L3 plants, respectively (Fig. 4B, C), demonstrating that these microspores failed to go through PMI. At the tricellular stage, the percentages of aberrant microspores or bicellular-like pollen in the proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi L7 and L3 plants reached 49.74 and 35.07%, respectively. This implies that there are an additional 10.59 and 5.78% of bicellular-like pollen that is incapable of undergoing PMII in the L7 and L3 plants, respectively (Fig. 4A-C). These observations demonstrated that knockdown of BRP4 expression had no effect on microspore formation but impaired the progression of both PMI and PMII during male gametogenesis.. . Fig. 4.. . Knockdown of BRP4 expression arrests the mitotic cell-cycle progression in male gametophytes. (A, B) DAPI staining of tetrads, microspores, and bicellular and tricellular pollen from WT (A) and transgenic proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi L7 (B) plants. Note that the abnormal uninucleate pollen (red arrows) and bicellular-like pollen (green arrow) are still present at the bicellular and tricellular development stages in transgenic proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi plants. The yellow arrow indicates shrunken pollen. Bar, 20 m. Tds, tetrads; MSp, microspores; BP, bicellular pollen; TP, tricellular pollen. (C) Quantification of different types of abnormally developed pollen from WT and transgenic proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi plants (L3 and L7). BP, bicellular pollen, TP, tricellular pollen. At the BP stage, about 1000 pollen grains were examined, and approximately 2500 pollen grains were examined at the TP stage. (D) Distribution of the DNA content of generative-cell nuclei at prophase from WT bicellular pollen (n=42) and generative-like cell nuclei at anthesis in proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi L3 (n=55) and L7 (n=50). The relative C-value of each nucleus was determined by the DAPI fluorescence value normalized against the mean fluorescence of WT nuclei (DNA=2C).. . . . It was reported previously that Arabidopsis generative cells at prophase contain about 2C of the mean DNA content (Friedman, 1999). We conducted DNA content analysis of the generative-like cells of proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi L7 and L3 plants at anthesis. In WT generative cells, the distribution of the DNA content ranged from 1.5 to 2.4C, which reflects technical variations in the measurement of fluorescence (Brownfield et al., 2009b). By contrast, more than 50% of the generative-like cells from L7 and L3 had a DNA content of 1-1.5C (Fig. 4D), suggesting that these generative-like cells may be arrested at the G1/S phase during the mitotic cell-cycle progression.. . . . ORC6 acts downstream of BRP4 during male gametogenesis. As BRP4 affects the mitotic cell-cycle progression of male gametophytes, we attempted to identify genes that may function downstream of BRP4. We examined expression of genes reported previously to be involved in the regulation of male gametogenesis, DUO1, DUO3, RHF1a, RHF2a, and CDKA;1, in both WT and proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi inflorescences. The expression levels of these genes were similar between the two genotypes (Supplementary Fig. S4A at JXB online), implying that these genes might not be downstream of BRP4. We then selected seven cell-cycle-related genes whose expression levels were reported to be high during male gametophyte development (Pina et al., 2005), and examined their expression in the inflorescences of both WT and proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi plants. As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression of a gene encoding a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC), ORC6, was obviously decreased in proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi inflorescences. The expression levels of the other six genes, CYCA2;1, CCS52A2, E2FB, CYCB3;1, CYCB2;4, and CYCD2;1, were similar between WT and proBRP4:BRP4 RNAi plants (Fig. 5A). To validate the possible regulation of ORC6 by BRP4, we generated transgenic plants carrying an oestradiol-inducible BRP4 construct, proXVE:BRP4. After transgenic seedlings were treated with the inducer, BRP4 was dramatically induced within 4h, and ORC6 was obviously upregulated after 8h, supporting the notion that ORC6 functions downstream of BRP4 (Supplementary Fig. S4B, C).. .

(D) Percentage of abnormal pollen in transgenic proBRP4:ORC6 RNAi L4 and L5 anthers. BP, bicellular pollen; TP, tricellular pollen. At the BP stage, about 1500 pollen grains were examined, and approximately 2500 pollen grains were examined at the TP stage. (E) DNA content analysis of WT generative-cell nuclei at prophase (n=42) and undivided generative-like cell nuclei at anthesis in proBRP4:ORC6 RNAi L4 (n=57) and L5 (n=53).. . . . To investigate the involvement of ORC6 in BRP4-mediated male gametogenesis, we generated transgenic plants harbouring a BRP4 promoter-driven ORC6 RNAi construct (proBRP4:ORC6 RNAi) (Supplementary Fig. S5A at JXB online). Of the 28 independent transgenic lines examined, 12 displayed pollen developmental defects (Fig. 5B). Detailed examination of the T3 plants of three independent lines (L2, L4, and L5) showed that the percentages of shrunken pollen grains were 36.53, 42.15, and 26.56%, respectively. In contrast, the WT and transgenic plants carrying an empty vector (containing only the BRP4 promoter fragment) produced 0.67 and 2.2% abnormal pollen, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Expression analysis showed that the reduced expression of ORC6 correlated to the percentages of defective pollen in L2, L4, and L5 plants. The expression of other ORC genes in these plants did not appear to differ from their expression levels observed in the WT (Supplementary Fig. S5C, D). Further DAPI staining in L4 and L5 revealed that 30.45 and 19.4% of the microspores failed to go through PMI, while another 12.62 and 9.29% were arrested at PMII, respectively (Fig. 5C, D). Moreover, the DNA content analysis of generative-like cells from proBRP4:ORC6 RNAi L4 and L5 plants showed that about 75.44 and 77.36% of the aborted generative cells had a DNA content in the range of 1-1.5C (Fig. 4E), suggesting that these generative-like cells are also impaired at the G1/S phase. These observations suggested that ORC6 acts downstream of BRP4, and that it is, at least in part, involved in the BRP4-mediated mitotic cell-cycle progression..
PMC4064807	Results. . The expression of the duplicated genes, AtHB7 and AtHB12, is coordinated during development. Aiming at knowing how these two genes are expressed during the plant life cycle, transcript levels of both AtHB7 and AtHB12 were first quantified in wild type (WT) Arabidopsis Col-0 (Columbia) ecotype at different growth stages. RNA was purified from 3-day-old seedlings and rosette leaves of 14, 21, 28, 38 and 45-day-old plants and transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR. In seedlings, AtHB12 transcripts levels were 16 times higher than in leaves of 28- to 45-day-old plants while AtHB7 transcripts were 30 times lower in seedlings than in leaves of 28-day-old and slowly decreased after this stage (Figure. 1A). As shown in Figure. 1A, the expression patterns of AtHB12 and AtHB7 were opposite; when one of them was highly expressed, the other was repressed. The expression levels of AtHB12 and AtHB7 were also analysed in response to osmotic stress induced by mannitol on 14-day-old plants. After this treatment, AtHB12 and AtHB7 transcript levels were induced 8- and 30-fold, respectively (Figure. 1B). A moderate water stress (MWS) treatment was also applied to soil-grown 45-day-old plants and consistent with the mannitol treatment, the transcript levels of both TFs were also induced (ca. 30-fold; Figure. 1C).. . Figure 1. . AtHB12 and AtHB7 expression levels fluctuate during development and in response to abiotic stress. (A) Total RNA was isolated from 3- and 14-day-old WT plants and from leaves of 21, 28, 38 and 45-day-old plants and analysed by qRT-PCR for AtHB7 and AtHB12 transcript levels with specific oligonucleotides (Additional file. 4). (B) Total RNA was isolated from 14-day-old plants treated with 300mM mannitol and analysed as in A. (C) RNA was isolated from leaves of 38-day-old plants subjected to a moderate water stress (MWS) starting at day 21 after germination, during 17days. Transcript levels values were normalised with AtHB7 transcripts at day 3 in A or at time 0 in B and C, applying the Ct method. Error bars represent SE calculated from three independent biological replicates. Actin transcripts (ACTIN2 and ACTIN8) were used as a reference. * , a, b, c and d denote statistical differences obtained with-ANOVA-Tukeys P<0.05.. . . . To substantiate the gene expression results observed by quantification of mRNA levels, transgenic plants carrying C-terminal protein fusions between AtHB7 or AtHB12 and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) - beta-GLUCURONIDASE (GUS) were generated. Aiming at reflecting as much as possible the real biological scenario, genomic fragments encompassing AtHB7 and AtHB12 promoter regions and coding sequences were cloned upstream of the reporter genes.. These transgenic plants were named pAtHB12:AtHB12::GFP::GUS and pAtHB7:AtHB7::GFP::GUS, respectively, and were analysed histochemically. The analysis was performed on 14-, 23- and 45-day-old plants, all grown in standard conditions (see Methods). As shown in Figure. 2, AtHB12 promoter activity was clearly detected in roots and leaves of 14 and 23-day-old plants (A and B) but not in 45-day-old plants (Figure. 2C). In contrast, AtHB7 promoter activity was only detectable in senescent leaves of 45-day-old plants (F) but not at earlier stages (D and E). Both, RNA expression and histochemical assays indicated that AtHB12 transcripts were particularly abundant during early developmental stages while AtHB7 during later stages. Such spatio-temporal differences in the expression of these TFs suggested that AtHB12 and AtHB7 have specific rather than redundant functions in plant growth and development.. . Figure 2. . GUS expression directed by AtHB7 or AtHB12 promoters depends on the stage of development.

AtHB7 and AtHB12 affect the expression of each other during development in standard growth conditions. Considering the almost opposite expression patterns of AtHB7 and AtHB12 during plant development in standard growth conditions (Figures. 1A and. 2), we investigated whether the expression of these TFs could influence each other. First, transient transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was conducted with the purpose of analysing whether AtHB7 and AtHB12 affected the activity of their paralogs promoter. Transient co-transformation of leaves by syringe-infiltration. [37] was performed with Agrobacteria carrying the constructs pAtHB7:AtHB7::GFP::GUS or pAtHB12:AtHB12::GFP::GUS and a construct in which each TF cDNA was under the control of the 35S CaMV (Cauliflower Mosaic Virus) promoter (35S::AtHB12 and 35S::AtHB7). Similar to Arabidopsis transgenic plants, genomic fragments encompassing AtHB7 and AtHB12 promoter regions and coding sequences were cloned upstream of the reporter genes. As negative and positive controls, pBI101.3 (non promoter::GUS) and pBI121 (35S::GUS) were used, respectively. Two days after leaf infiltration, GUS transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR.. Leaves co-transformed with pAtHB12:AtHB12::GFP::GUS plus 35S::AtHB7 or plus 35S::AtHB12 expressed GUS at approximately 2-fold higher levels than leaves co-transformed with pAtHB12:AtHB12::GFP::GUS plus pBI101.3 (Figure. 3A). When leaves were co-transformed with pAtHB7:AtHB7::GFP::GUS plus 35S::AtHB12 or plus 35S::AtHB7, GUS expression was approximately 6-fold higher than in control leaves co-transformed with pAtHB7:AtHB7::GFP::GUS plus pBI101.3 (Figure. 3A).. . Figure 3. . AtHB12 and AtHB7 regulate each other along development in standard growth conditions. Total RNA was isolated from mutant and WT plants (indicated in the top). AtHB12 and AtHB7 transcript levels were analysed at three different developmental stages (14-, 23- and 38-day old plants); a scheme of the proposed effect of each TF on the other is shown on the right (positive  or negative --/ effect). (A) Transcript levels of GUS after transient co-transformation of N. benthamiana leaves with A. tumefaciens carrying pAtHB12::GFP::GUS or pAtHB7::GFP::GUS and the constructs indicated in the x axis, quantified by qRT-PCR. Values were normalised with respect to that measured in control samples (pAtHB12::GFP::GUS or pAtHB7::GFP::GUS + pBI 101.3) by Ct method. (B) Transcripts levels in 14-day-old plants. (C) Transcripts levels in 23-day-old leaves. (D) Transcripts levels in 38-day-old leaves. Transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR and the values normalised with respect to that measured in WT plants applying the Ct method. Error bars represent SE calculated from three independent biological replicates. Actin transcripts (ACTIN2 and ACTIN8) were used as a reference. * denotes statistical differences obtained with one-way-ANOVA-Tukeys P<0.05.. . . . These results indicated that in the tobacco heterologous transient system, the ectopic expression of either AtHB12 or AtHB7 positively affects the activity of their own promoter and of their paralogs promoter. However, even though both genes exhibit in their regulatory regions some elements partially matching the pseudopalindromic sequence CAAT(A/T)ATTG (bound in vitro by all the HD-Zip I tested so far. [14,15]), a transient transformation assay in a heterologous system provides only partial evidence of a potential direct interaction between the tested TFs and their promoters. Thus, to further investigate the putative effect of AtHB12 and AtHB7 on the expression of each other, single mutants (athb12 and athb7), a double knock-down mutant (at12/7) and overexpressors of each of these genes (AT12 and AT7) were obtained and characterised.. Transcript levels of AtHB7 and AtHB12 were quantified in all the genotypes and control plants at three different developmental stages. In 14-day-old plants, AtHB12 presented almost the same expression levels in AT7 as in WT plants but expression was almost undetectable in athb7 plants. Notably, AtHB7 transcript levels in AT7 plants were lower than in WT plants during this developmental stage, which is worth noting since in AT7 plants, AtHB7 expression is driven by the 35S CaMV promoter. Thus, based on this observation, it is tempting to speculate that AtHB7 transcripts are degraded in the overexpressor lines by the triggering of post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms. [38]. Moreover, at this developmental stage, AT12 plants exhibited 2-fold lower AtHB7 mRNA levels than WT (Figure. 3B). Altogether, these observations suggested that AtHB12 may repress AtHB7 expression and, on the other hand, that AtHB7 induces AtHB12 expression at the transcriptional level in the vegetative stage (Figure. 3B).. Twenty three days after germination, the plants already transitioned to the reproductive phase under the growth conditions used for this study. At this stage, AtHB12 transcripts were 4-fold higher, both in AT7 and athb7 plants compared with WT plants. AtHB7 exhibited similar transcript levels in AT12 and WT plants and higher levels in athb12 and AT7 plants compared to WT plants (Figure. 3C). These observations suggested that AtHB12 somehow down-regulated AtHB7 expression while AtHB7 did not affect AtHB12 expression at this developmental stage (Figure. 3C).. The scenario changed in 38-day-old plants; AtHB12 transcript levels were 4-fold lower in AT7 and 2-fold higher in athb7 than in WT plants (Figure. 3D). AtHB7 transcript levels were 4-fold and 16-fold higher in AT7 and athb12, respectively, than in WT plants and 1.3-fold lower in AT12 than in WT plants. At 23- and 38-day-old, AT7 plants exhibited high AtHB7 transcript levels as it is expected when plants are transformed with constitutive promoters like the 35S CaMV (Figure. 3D).. To summarize, the results presented so far could be interpreted by the scheme shown in the right panel of Figure. 3. This scheme illustrates that at early developmental stages, AtHB7 positively regulates AtHB12, and that AtHB12 negatively regulates AtHB7. In mature plants, the effect observed is a double negative feedback loop between AtHB7 and AtHB12. These results, together with those obtained by N. benthamiana transient co-transformation, suggest a complex regulation of AtHB7 and AtHB12 expression, changing during development and requiring the participation of additional factors. However, it is necessary to understand if this regulation or coordination between AtHB7 and AtHB12 has a functional purpose.. . . Changes in AtHB7 and AtHB12 expression affect seedling root growth, bolting time and leaf growth. The differential pattern of AtHB7 and AtHB12 expression observed in Arabidopsis during development led us to investigate the physiological processes controlled by these two TFs. For this purpose, a deep phenotypic characterization of mutant and overexpressor plants in standard growth conditions was conducted.. Plants were grown on MS-Agar plates and roots of 8 to 14day-old seedlings of AT12, AT7, athb12, athb7 and at12/7 genotypes were analysed. AT12 seedlings exhibited 15-20% longer roots while AT7 and at12/7 had 20% shorter primary roots than WT plants. Mutant athb12 and athb7 genotypes did not showed statistically significant differences (Figure. 4A).. . Figure 4. . AtHB12 and AtHB7 contribute to control roots elongation, bolting time, shoots length and leaves development. (A). Roots length (cm) of 8- to 14-day-old plants grown in standard conditions. (B) Percentage of bolted WT and mutant plants since 19 to 26days after germination. (C) Shoot length (cm) analysed during plant development (between days 23 to 45). (D) Total rosette area of 20- and 45-day-old plants. Illustrative pictures of rosettes of each genotype are shown at the bottom. Error bars represent SE (A: n=10; B: n=3 independent assays with 8 plants per genotype each assay; C and D: n=8); *, a, b, c, d, e and f denote statistical differences obtained with one-way-ANOVA-Tukeys P<0.05.. . . . Developmental stages in Arabidopsis can be generally divided in vegetative (before bolting) and reproductive (after bolting). [39]. Bolting occurred at day 22 for 80% of WT, AT12 and athb7 plants while this event occurred at day 25 (3days later) for 80% of AT7, athb12 and at12/7 plants (Figure. 4B). AT7, athb12 and at12/7 plants showed a delay in shoot elongation at the beginning of the life cycle but this difference disappeared at later stages and the height of the stems were similar in all genotypes (Figure. 4C). The rosette area of 20-day-old plants from genotypes athb12, AT7 and at12/7 was 25% smaller than WT. In 45-day-old plants, the AT7 genotype exhibited 50% larger rosettes than WT while AT12 rosettes were similar to those of WT (Figure. 4D). Altogether it can be concluded that in early stages, AtHB12 is necessary for proper growth of rosette leaves but this role is undertaken by AtHB7 at later stages. These data suggested similar roles but at different developmental stages, for these HD-Zip I TFs.. . . Differences in AtHB7 and AtHB12 expression affect chlorophyll content, photosynthesis rate and senescence. Considering the differences in leaf-area observed between mutant and overexpressor plants (Figure. 4D), we investigated whether these differences were also reflected in photosynthesis rate and/or chlorophyll content. Chlorophyll content was similar in WT, mutant and overexpressor 20-day-old plants (data not shown), but 45- day-old AT7 and AT12 plants (among all the genotypes) exhibited significant differences. AT7 showed a 15% chlorophyll increase per mg of leaf tissue while AT12 a 15% decrease, both compared to WT (Figure. 5A). Using an Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA), photosynthetic rates were analysed. Forty five-day-old AT7 and athb12 plants exhibited respectively 25% and 15% higher photosynthetic rates (measured as the exchanged CO2 per unit of leaf area [molm-2s-1] than controls and other mutant and overexpressors (Figure. 5B). In addition to the differential photosynthesis rates and chlorophyll content of AT7 plants, senescence was delayed in these plants. Illustrative pictures are shown in Figure. 5C. Forty seven-day-old AT12 plants were the most senescent with 23% yellow area relative to the entire leaf area while AT7 plants were the less senescent presenting only a 6% yellow area (Figure. 5C). The other genotypes, athb7, athb12 and at12/7 exhibited around a 10% senescent area at this developmental stage (Figure. 5C). These results suggested that AtHB7 delays senescence while AtHB12 induces it.. . Figure 5. . Chlorophyll content, photosynthesis rate and senescence time are regulated by AtHB7 and AtHB12 in mature plants. (A) Total chlorophyll content quantified in 45-day-old plants leaves. Extracts were prepared from green rosette leaves of plants grown under standard conditions during 45-days. (B) Photosynthetic rate quantified with IRGA in leaves of 45-day-old plants.

Error bars represent SE (n=5); * denotes statistical differences obtained with one-way-ANOVA-Tukeys P<0.05.. . . . . . Differences in AtHB12 and AtHB7 expression affect water uptake, water loss and seed setting during moderate water stress conditions. Knowing that AtHB12 and AtHB7 are up-regulated by water and osmotic stress (this work,. [13,18], phenotypes related to dehydration responses were analysed. In this sense, stomata number and dynamics, water uptake, water loss, and production of seeds were evaluated in AtHB7 and AtHB12 mutant and overexpressor lines.. Stomatal density, quantified as the number of stomata per area unit and stomatal pore aperture were evaluated in leaves of 38-40-day-old plants grown in standard growth conditions (see Methods section). As shown in Figure. 6A, the stomata number was similar in mutant and overexpressor lines. Regarding stomata aperture, AT7 plants had on average 30% smaller pores than WT while at12/7, AT12 and athb7 had on average 15-20% bigger pores than WT (Figure. 6B).. . Figure 6. . AtHB7 induces stomata closure. (A). Stomatal density was determined by counting pores per area under microscopy in 38-day-old leaves. (B) Stomatas aperture (mum) was evaluated in three 38-day-old leaves from different individuals per genotype. (C) Stomatas conductance determined by IRGA and expressed as mol H2O m-2s-1.

Error bars represent SE (A: n=5 pictures per genotype; B: n=15 stomatas from three different leaves per genotype; C: n=4 leaves per genotype); *, a, b, c and d denote statistical differences obtained with one-way-ANOVA-Tukeys P<0.05.. . . . Water conductance in leaves was quantified by IRGA. AT7, athb12, athb7 and at12/7 showed lower levels of conductance than WT and AT12 plants (Figure. 6C). To evaluate the dynamics of the stomata in response to dehydration conditions, a water-loss assay was performed. Leaves were detached from the plant, placed on tissue paper and weighted every ten minutes to evaluate water loss by transpiration. AT12 leaves exhibited a more pronounced water-loss curve while water loss in AT7 leaves was less pronounced (Figure. 6D); athb12, athb7 and at12/7 plants showed no differences compared to WT (Additional file. 1). The results suggested that AtHB7 induced stomata closure while AtHB12 induced stomata opening.. . . Differences in AtHB12 and AtHB7 expression affect seed production under moderate water stress or standard conditions. To evaluate water uptake under stress conditions, soil-grown plants were exposed to a moderate water stress (MWS; see Methods section) by irrigating with the minimal volume necessary to maintain pots weight equal during the treatment. Water was applied every 48-72 hours and the needed volume for each genotype added and documented. AT7, athb12, athb7 and at12/7 plants needed 20% less water to maintain equal pot weight during the complete MWS treatment compared with WT and AT12 genotypes (Figure. 7A). At the end of the life cycle, concomitant with the stress treatment, all produced seeds were harvested and weighted (total seed weight = yield). This quantification showed that athb12, athb7 and at12/7 yielded 15-20% less than WT and AT7, while AT12 plants yielded 20% more than WT (Figure. 7B, left panel). In standard conditions we did not observe statistically significant differences between genotypes in seed production (Figure. 7B, right panel).. . Figure 7. . AtHB12 and AtHB7 are involved in determining water conductance and uptake, and seeds production. Plants were grown (1 per pot) and MWS treatment was started at day 20. (A) Water (ml) added to maintain the same weight in all pots, considered as water uptake during the stress treatment. (B) Seeds production in plants grown under MWS conditions (left) or standard conditions (right), as g / plant. Mean is shown and error bars represent SE (A: n=5; B and C: n=10); * denotes statistical differences obtained with one-way-ANOVA-Tukeys P<0.05.. . . . These results suggested that AtHB12 and AtHB7 have particular functions in Arabidopsis performance during water limiting conditions. Both may coordinate the regulation of each other expression depending on the stage of development and the availability of water..
PMC2807924	RESULTSNaringenin Addition Results in the Formation of New AnthocyaninsThe addition of naringenin to tt5 or wild-type seedlings grown in conditions that induce anthocyanin biosynthetic genes (AIC, Anthocyanin Inductive Conditions; Poustka et al., 2007) results in increased pigment formation compared to seedlings grown in identical conditions, but without naringenin. In addition, naringenin-treated seedlings accumulate significantly more AVIs than control ones, yet the number of AVIs does not directly correlate with total anthocyanin accumulation (Poustka et al., 2007). Naringenin has a modest effect on seedling germination or development at concentrations up to 100muM (Supplemental Figure 1), the naringenin concentration used in all the experiments described in this study.To determine whether the number of AVIs that accumulate in seedlings grown under AIC relate to a particular anthocyanin, rather than to total anthocyanin levels, we compared the HPLC anthocyanin profiles of wild-type and tt5 seedlings grown in AIC, treated and not treated with naringenin. The tt5 mutant is in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) genetic background, but, because we use Columbia (Col) in other sections of this study, we investigated here the anthocyanin profiles of both Ler and Col as wild-type lines. Thirteen anthocyanins were found in wild-type seedlings grown in AIC without naringenin, and we numbered the peaks here 1-13 (Figure 1 and Table 1). The anthocyanin profiles of Ler and Col seedlings are similar with regard to the types of anthocyanins that they accumulate (compare Figure 1A and 1C), but there are clear differences in the relative abundance of particular anthocyanins (e.g. peaks 6 and 7, Figure 1A and 1C). The addition of naringenin to tt5 or to either of the two wild-types resulted in the appearance of at least four new anthocyanin peaks (a, b, c, and d in Figure 1), without a significant change in the relative abundance of the other anthocyanins (Figure 1). The flavonol profiles, however, remain similar between the wild-type lines, with and without naringenin. However, the tt5 mutant, which normally has no flavonols, when complemented with naringenin, synthesized flavonols to levels approximately 30% of those present in Ler (not shown). These results are of significance because they suggest that despite the efficient uptake of naringenin by seedlings grown in AIC (Poustka et al., 2007), the levels of flavonoids in complemented tt5 mutant fail to reach the levels in wild-type seedlings, perhaps suggesting an inefficiency of naringenin in reaching the biosynthetic complexes.Table 1.Characteristics of the Anthocyanin Peaks Identified in Figure 1.PeakRt (min.)lambda features (nm)ESI-MS (m/z)MS/MS fragments (m/z)MSe fragmentation (m/z)PAP1-D (Tohge et al., 2005)a4.0520611.16449 [Cy + Glc]+ 287 [Cy]+b4.5500611.16449 [Cy + Glc]+ 287 [Cy]+14.8513743.21449 [Cy + Glc]+ 287 [Cy]+581, 449, 287c503611.16449 [Cy + Glc]+1 287 [Cy]+25.2530949.27449 [Cy + Glc]+ 287 [Cy]+787, 449, 287A4d5.5516449.11287 [Cy]+36.25271137.32889 [Cy + 2Glc + Xyl + Cou]+ 535 [Cy + 2Glc + Mal]+ 287 [Cy]+975A846.45401343.471095 [Cy + 2Glc + Xyl + Cou + Sin]+ 535 [Cy + 2Glc _ Mal]+ 287 [Cy]+1095, 535A11 (see Supp. Fig. 4)57.55201257.411095 [Cy + 2Glc + Xyl + Cou + Sin]+ 449 [Cy + Glc]+ 287 [Cy]+1137, 897, 889, 535, 287A1068.25351343.541095 [Cy + 2Glc + Xyl + Cou + Sin]+ 535 [Cy + 2Glc + Mal]+ 287 [Cy]+1095, 535, 287A11 (see Supp. Fig. 4)79.05301181.34933 [C + Glc + Xyl + Sin + Cou]+ 535 [Cy + 2Glc + Mal]+ 287 [Cy]+975 727, 535, 287A9810.2520889.25727 [Cy + Glc + Xyl + Cou]+ 449 [Cy + Glc]+ 287 [Cy]+A3910.85301095.31933 [Cy + Glc + Xyl + Sin + Cou]+ 449 [Cy + Glc]+ 287 [Cy]+1011.6525975.24727 [Cy + Glc + Xyl + Cou]+ 535 [Cy + 2Glc + Mal]+ 287 [Cy]+1111.9326/ 5351005.26757 535 [Cy + 2Glc + Mal]+ 287 [Cy]+1212.2320/ 5351181.33933 [Cy + Glc + Xyl + Sin + Cou]+ 535 [Cy + 2Glc + Mal]+ 287 [Cy]+A91312.6326/5301211.36963, 535, 287Rt, retention time; Cy, cyanidin; Glc, glucose; Xyl, xylose; Cou, p-coumaroyl moiety; Mal, malonyl moiety; Sin, sinapoly moiety. The PAP-1D column corresponds to the anthocyanin names assigned in Tohge et al. (2005).Figure 1.Anthocyanin Profiles of Arabidopsis Seedlings in the Presence or Absence of Naringenin.HPLC chromatographic profiles of anthocyanins at 520nm of 3-day-old wild-type (Ler) (A, B); Col (C, D); and tt5 (E, F) grown in the absence (-Nar., A, C, and E) or presence (+Nar., B, D, and F) of 100muM naringenin. Peaks a, b, c, and d (red lines) correspond to anthocyanins newly accumulated upon the addition of naringenin. Peaks 1-13 correspond to anthocyanins previously described and characterized in Table 1. Anthocyanins were extracted from identical amounts of dry material, and the same volume was injected in each run.To determine the identity of all the anthocyanins, we performed HPLC-MS/MS. Eight of the peaks match those as previously reported by Tohge et al. (2005) (Table 1). Several new anthocyanins were also detected in wild-type plants. Peak d, the most abundant one after the addition of naringenin, has a parent cation of 449.11m/z and a fragment of 287.06m/z, consistent with C3G (Table 1). Its identity as C3G was further confirmed by the UV-visible spectrum and its co-elution with an authentic C3G standard (Supplemental Figure 2). Peaks a, b, and c (each 611.16m/z and co-eluting in extracts from wild-type plants) appear to correspond to cyanidin 3-O-diglucoside derivatives, based on the fragmentation profile (611>449287m/z). However, the structures of peaks a, b, and c have yet to be unequivocally established (Table 1).We investigated the accumulation of the new peaks over time, after naringenin addition in tt5. C3G (peak d) appeared 3h after naringenin addition, peaking at 12h, to then decrease (Figure 2), while peaks a and b continued to increase, albeit at significantly lower levels than C3G. Peak c, although identified by LC-MS, co-eluted with peak 1 and could not be quantified by PDA-HPLC. Most other peaks remained unchanged (Supplemental Figure 3). Based on total absorbance at 520nm (A520), peaks a and b correspond respectively to 1.8 and 1.6% of the total anthocyanins present in Ler+Nar (24h after Nar induction, Figure 1), while peak d corresponds to 14.7%.Figure 2.Time-Course Accumulation of Anthocyanin Peaks a, b, and c after Naringenin Addition.Quantification of anthocyanin peaks a, b, and c in 3-day-old wild-type (Ler) seedlings treated with 100muM naringenin for different (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24-h) periods of time. The quantification is based on peak area (muVol*sec) measurements of HPLC chromatograms revealed at 520nm.These results suggest that the addition of naringenin to tt5 or wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings results in the accumulation of C3G, an anthocyanin normally absent in Arabidopsis under normal growth conditions, yet likely a precursor in the accumulation of some of the more complex anthocyanins present (Supplemental Figure 4). In addition, several new anthocyanins with chemical structures yet to be determined were found to be present as well.Increase in AVI Numbers in Anthocyanin 5-O-Glucosyltransferase (5gt) MutantsNaringenin-supplemented seedlings accumulate significantly more AVIs than control plants (Poustka et al., 2007). To determine whether the accumulation of AVIs is directly linked to the increased accumulation of C3G or C3G derivatives, we investigated the AVI distribution of 5GT mutant (5gt), which fail to conjugate a glycosyl group at the 5-O position of the anthocyanidin core (Tohge et al., 2005). In our induction conditions, the addition of naringenin increases the accumulation of anthocyanins in 5gt to levels comparable to wild-type (Figure 3A, 5gt), primarily as a consequence of the increase of C3G (compare peak d in Figure 3B and 3C).Figure 3.Anthocyanin Accumulation in 3gt and 5gt Seedlings.(A) Spectrophotometric measurement (520nm) of anthocyanin contents of 3gt, 5gt, and wild-type (Col) seedlings grown in AIC in the absence (-Nar) or presence (+Nar) of 100muM naringenin. Anthocyanin accumulation levels correspond to arbitrary units obtained by dividing the absorbance at 520nm by the mass of the starting plant material and the volume fraction used in the measurements.(B-D) Chromatographic profiles (520nm) of 5gt and Col 3-day-old seedlings grown in the absence (A) or presence (B and C) of 100muM naringenin.To determine the identity of all the anthocyanins present in 5gt grown in AIC, we performed HPLC-MS/MS. Ten new peaks have been identified and named 14-26 (Figure 3B and 3C and Table 2). Peaks a, b, c (611.16m/z peaks), and d (449.11m/z peak), previously identified in wild-type plants grown in AIC with naringenin, were also found in the 5gt mutant and are the only ones in common by both m/z and elution time (Figure 3B-3D). Since 5gt should be devoid of 5-O-glycosides, either the 611 species correspond to 3-O-glycosides or are glycosylated at a position other than 3-O or 5-O. Moreover, as both wild-type and 5gt were induced with naringenin for these experiments, this could explain why 449m/z was not previously detected (Tohge et al., 2005).Table 2.Characteristics of the Anthocyanin Peaks Identified in the 5gt Mutant + Naringenin.PeakRt (min.)lambda features (nm)ESI-MS (m/z)MSe fragmentation (m/z)144.0510611.16287a511743.21287154.5511611.16287b504743.21287c4.8505611.16287165.5516581.15287d515449.11287175.7532/332787.21187.7527889.25449198.4522889.25727208.6519889.25727, 449218.9510889.25727, 449229.2537/3181095.322310.6538/287933.252872410.9527/320727.192872512.6523/311727.192872613.4535/320933.25287Rt, retention time.In wild-type, there is only one 743-m/z species, but in 5gt, there are two 743-m/z peaks that do not co-elute with the species in wild-type, yet share the same accurate mass and anthocyanin PDA spectrum. Similar isobaric species were detected for 1181m/z (two peaks) and 1343m/z (two peaks) in wild-type extracts. In 5gt, this trend towards isomers seems more prevalent with 743m/z (two peaks), 889m/z (four peaks), 727m/z (two peaks), and 933m/z (two peaks). Most of these multiples involve a dominant species, which are likely the single species previously identified (Tohge et al., 2005). The 889-m/z peaks in 5gt (peaks 18-21, Figure 3B and 3C) are of particular interest, as there are four of them and of similar intensity. We expect they are positional isomers of the 889-m/z species in wild-type (peak 8, Figure 3D), as the 5-O-glucoside should not be available in 5gt. Similarly, the 743-m/z species (peaks 14 and 15, Figure 3B and 3C) and the 1095-m/z specie (peak 22, Figure 3B and 3C) in 5gt are likely an isomer of the 743-m/z (peak 1, Figure 3D) and 1095-m/z (peak 9) species in wild-type, respectively (Figure 3D and Table 1). Perhaps, in the absence of 5GT activity, 3GT or another glycosyl transferase can introduce elsewhere similar modifications to those present in the 5-O position of groups 1-3. Establishing this will require the structural elucidation of these compounds by NMR. Our studies highlight the value of exploring the metabolic space of mutants as a way to uncover novel catalytic functions obscured in wild-type plants.In contrast to 5gt, 3gt mutant accumulate almost no anthocyanins, and the addition of naringenin resulted in a very modest increase (Figure 3A, 3gt), providing evidence that 3-O glycosylation is necessary prior to 5-O glycosylation.When 5gt seedlings were visualized under the microscope, a very significant induction of AVIs became evident. Almost every single cell in the adaxial epidermal layer of the cotyledon displayed at least one AVI (compare Figure 4A and 4C, Figure 4G and 4H), regardless of whether the media were supplemented with naringenin or not (Figure 5A). As expected, no AVIs were observed in the 3gt mutant (Figures 4E and 5A). These results indicate that the 5gt mutation dramatically increases the formation of AVIs. The increased accumulation of AVIs in the 5gt mutant is not restricted to seedlings grown in AICs. When we examined 3-week-old seedlings grown in plates under standard growth conditions, large numbers of AVIs were found in a region of the stem (Supplemental Figure 5). A similar accumulation of AVIs in 5gt, but not in the wild-type, was observed in rosette leaves (Supplemental Figure 5). These results suggest that the increased formation of AVIs is a general characteristic of anthocyanin accumulating cells in the 5gt mutant.Figure 4.AVI Formation in 3gt and 5gt Seedlings.(A-F) Three-day-old 3gt and 5gt mutants and wild-type (Col) seedlings treated with 100muM naringenin (+Nar), treated or not treated with 1mM vanadate (Na3VO4, +/-Van). Scale bars: A-F: 0.5mm.(G, H) Microscopic view of Col and 5gt mutant cells (adaxial side of the cotyledons), treated with 100muM naringenin (+Nar). Scale bar G-H: 30mum.Figure 5.Quantification of AVI and NRSB Numbers in 3gt, 5gt, and Col Seedlings Induced with Naringenin.(A) Number of AVIs and (B) number of neutral red staining sub-vacuolar structures (NRSBs) present in 5gt and wild-type (Col) seedlings treated with 100muM naringenin (+Nar), treated or left untreated with 1mM vanadate (+/-Van). Seedlings were observed 24h after the addition of naringenin and vanadate.Previously, we showed that vanadate was a strong inducer of AVI formation in wild-type or naringenin-complemented tt5 seedlings (Poustka et al., 2007). The addition of vanadate did not induce AVI formation in the 3gt mutant (Figures 4F and 5A). In 5gt seedlings, AVIs in every cell continued to form, irrespective of whether vanadate was present or not (Figures 4D and 5A), the bluish color reflecting the alkalinization of the vacuole induced by vanadate (Poustka et al., 2007).AVIs Are Likely Formed by the Filling of Pre-Existing Sub-Vacuolar StructuresWe described before that neutral red (NR) stains Arabidopsis sub-vacuolar structures (referred to hereafter as NRSB for NR-staining bodies) (Poustka et al., 2007). NR also stains the AVIs, and the number of cells with NRSB is always significantly larger than the number of cells with AVIs (compare Col in Figure 5A and 5B) (Poustka et al., 2007), suggesting that the detection of the NRSBs with NR is more sensitive than the coloration of the AVI provided by the anthocyanins, or that sub-vacuolar inclusions without anthocyanins exist.To investigate the contribution of the different anthocyanins in AVI formation, we examined NRSBs in the 3gt and 5gt mutants. About 10-25% of the abaxial epidermal cells of the cotyledons of Col seedlings grown in AIC contain NR-staining sub-vacuolar structures (Figure 5B). This number does not significantly change in the presence of naringenin (compare -Nar and +Nar, Figure 5B). The 3gt mutant accumulates significantly less NRSB than Col, with a slight induction in the NRSB numbers when the seedlings were grown in the presence of naringenin (Figure 5B). This is in sharp contrast to the 5gt mutant, in which every single cell shows NRSB (Figure 5B) filled with anthocyanins (Figures 4C and 5A). Interestingly, vanadate induces the formation of NRSB in Col and in 3gt to levels similar to those found normally in the 5gt mutant (Figure 5B). A similar ability of vanadate to induce NRSB in almost every cell was observed in tt5 seedlings and in other pathway mutants, including tt3 (mutant in dihydroflavonol reductase, DFR) and tt19 (a mutant in a GST) (not shown). These results demonstrate that the formation of NR-staining sub-vacuolar compartments is independent of anthocyanin accumulation. Moreover, these results suggest that anthocyanins accumulating in the vacuolar sap might be taken up by these NRSBs, resulting in AVIs. Alternatively, a particular type of anthocyanin-filled NRSBs (visualized as AVIs) could form de novo, perhaps as part of the vacuolar uptake of anthocyanin-containing cytoplasmic vesicles (Poustka et al., 2007).We next evaluated the possibility that particular anthocyanin(s) would be associated with AVI formation, by examining the effect of vanadate on the distribution of the various anthocyanins. Interestingly, while naringenin induced C3G (peak d, Figure 6), vanadate reduced C3G accumulation and instead resulted in the induction of peak 6 (Figure 6, compare Col+Nar and Col+Nar+Van). According to the MS analysis, peak 6 corresponds to A11 (Tohge et al., 2005), the most highly decorated anthocyanin found in Arabidopsis (Supplemental Figure 4). Consistent with peak 6 being modified at both the 3-O and 5-O positions, in the 5gt mutant, vanadate causes an overall decrease in anthocyanin accumulation without any peak increasing (Figure 6, compare 5gt+Nar and 5gt+Nar+Van). We conclude from these results that while the presence of C3G (or derivatives) can be associated with AVI formation, as is the case in the 5gt mutant, the mechanism by which vanadate induces AVIs involves the increased accumulation of compounds also modified at the 5-O position.Figure 6.Effect of Vanadate on Anthocyanin Profiles.HPLC chromatograms of anthocyanins (520nm) of 3-day-old wild-type (Col) or 5gt seedlings grown in the presence (+Nar) of 100muM naringenin, with or without the addition of 1mM vanadate (+/-Van).These results provide strong evidence that the NRSBs correspond to sub-vacuolar structures that exist even in the absence of anthocyanins. The formation of NRSBs dramatically induced by vanadate, and when anthocyanins accumulate, the NRSBs serve as an accumulation site for them, resulting in the AVIs. Some anthocyanins, in particular C3G and derivatives, appear to preferentially accumulate inside NRSBs, explaining the observation that all NRSBs are AVIs in 5gt mutants. However, these results also suggest that the 5gt mutant has the ability to form more NRSBs than wild-type, prompting the question of how the NRSBs form.Autophagy and AVI FormationTo determine whether an autophagic mechanism participates in AVI formation, we investigated the effect of mutations in genes that participate in autophagy on AVI and NRSB formation. We had previously examined the effect of the atg7-1 mutant on AVI formation, and we could not observe a significant difference in the number of NRSBs or AVIs when atg7-1 seedlings were grown under AIC, compared to a wild-type ecotype Ws (Wassileskija) control. Ws seedlings accumulate a low level of anthocyanins and have significantly reduced numbers of AVIs and NRSBs compared to Col or Ler (Poustka et al., 2007).Thus, we obtained atg5, atg9, and atg10 mutants in the Col background. ATG5 is an autophagic protein that forms a conjugate with the ubiquitin-like protein, ATG12. This conjugation is essential for the formation of sequestering vesicles, and hence for plant nutrient recycling. The atg5 mutant displays early senescence and atg5 plants are hypersensitive to nitrogen or carbon starvation, accompanied by a more rapid loss of organellar and cytoplasmic proteins (Thompson et al., 2005). The ATG12-ATG5 conjugation is directed by ATG7, an E1-like ATP-dependent activating enzyme (Doelling et al., 2002), and the E2-like protein, ATG10. The atg10 mutant is hypersensitive to nitrogen and carbon starvation and initiates senescence and programmed cell death more quickly than wild-type (Phillips et al., 2008). ATG9 is an integral membrane protein that may be required for membrane delivery for the growing of pre-autophagosomal structures (Nair and Klionsky, 2005).While all the atg mutants tested appear to have normal anthocyanin levels at 4d after germination (DAG), a significant reduction was observed for atg5 (P=0.002, two-sided t-test) and atg10 (P=0.054, two-sided t-test) at 5DAG (Figure 7A and 7B). The anthocyanin profiles in the atg mutants also show distinctive patterns, particular at 5DAG (Figure 8). Most anthocyanin peaks are significantly reduced in atg5, but peak 6 appears to be the most significantly affected, particularly when considered in relation to some of the other major anthocyanins present. The addition of vanadate to atg5 further reduces peak 6. A similar situation is observed for atg10, although, in this case, vanadate has no additional effect on peak 6. In contrast, no major effect on anthocyanin profiles was observed for atg9, even after the treatment with vanadate (Figure 8). These results indicate that, despite all the ATG genes being part of a common cellular process, each mutant has a unique fingerprint when it comes to anthocyanin accumulation. In addition, each atg mutant responds in a unique way to the treatment of vanadate, with respect to anthocyanin profiles.Figure 7.Autophagic Mutants and Anthocyanin Accumulation.(A) Spectrophotometric measurement (520nm) of anthocyanin content of atg5, atg9, atg10, and wild-type (Col) seedlings 4 and 5d after germination (DAG) grown in AIC. Anthocyanin accumulation levels correspond to arbitrary units obtained by dividing the absorbance at 520nm by the mass of the starting plant material and the volume fraction used in the measurements.(B) Microscopic pictures of atg5, atg9, atg10, and wild-type (Col) seedlings 4 and 5days after germination (DAG) grown in AIC.Figure 8.Autophagic Mutants and Anthocyanin Profiles.HPLC chromatograms of anthocyanins (520nm) of atg5, atg9, atg10, and wild-type (Col) seedlings 5DAG grown in AIC in the absence (left panel) or presence of 1mM vanadate (Van).We next investigated the number of AVIs present at 4 and 5DAG. The atg5 and atg10 mutants displayed a very significant reduction in the overall numbers of AVIs. No AVIs could be observed in atg5 seedlings at either age, and atg10 had no detectable AVIs at 5DAG (Figure 9A). When we stained with NR, atg5 and atg10 showed a significantly lower number of NRSB compared to wild-type, while the levels in atg9 appear to be lower at 4DAG but increase above the Col control at 5DAG (Figure 9B). It is apparent that there is an overall reduction in AVIs and NRSBs as the seedlings become older (compare Col 4 and 5DAG, Figure 9A). The treatment with vanadate, however, resulted in the increased formation of AVIs (Figure 9A) and NRSBs (Figure 9B). Interestingly, while vanadate induces NRSB formation in 100% of the epidermal cells in wild-type plants, the number of NRSBs in vanadate-treated atg mutants never reaches wild-type levels (Figure 9B). Time-course experiments following the number of NRSBs in wild-type and atg5 after vanadate treatment further showed a very slow increase in the number of NRSBs compared with a very rapid increase in wild-type (not shown). Taken together, these results suggest a significant participation of an autophagic mechanism in the formation of the NRSBs, which is further accentuated in the capacity of these structures to become AVIs.Figure 9.AVI and NRSB Formation in Autophagic Mutants.(A) Number of AVIs and (B) number of neutral red staining sub-vacuolar structures (NRSBs) present in agt mutants and wild-type (Col) seedlings 4 or 5DAG treated with 100muM naringenin (+Nar), treated or left untreated with 1mM vanadate (Van). Seedlings were observed 24h after the addition of naringenin and/or vanadate.

PMC4792959	Results. . PT overgrowth restricts gene flow between Arabidopsis species. Self-fertilizing A. thaliana and its outcrossing relative A. lyrata are separated by strong pre-pollination barriers due to their different mating systems1. In addition, they are isolated by post-pollination barriers based on direct male-female interactions. Although A. thaliana (Col-0) pollen germination is inhibited at the A. lyrata stigma, A. lyrata PTs are guided towards A. thaliana embryo sacs, but PT reception fails (Fig. 1c, as opposed to Fig. 1b showing successful PT reception, Supplementary Fig. 1). Such unilateral incompatibility is similar to that observed in other crosses between self-compatible and self-incompatible species25. We also observed PT overgrowth in interspecific crosses between A. arenosa and A. lyrata (Supplementary Fig. 2), between which natural gene flow occurs26. This finding indicates that A. lyrata PT overgrowth in A. thaliana ovules does not only occur between species that do not interbreed in nature (A. thaliana  A. lyrata) but also between species that are only partially reproductively isolated and do interbreed (A. arenosa  A. lyrata).. . . Natural variation in interspecific PT reception. To analyse interspecific hybridization barriers within the genus Arabidopsis, we assessed PT overgrowth in 86 A. thaliana accessions that were pollinated with A. lyrata pollen (Supplementary Table 1). PTs were visualized by staining callose in PT cell walls with aniline blue. We scored the proportion of ovules that failed to recognize interspecific PTs-leading to PT overgrowth-in relation to the total number of ovules that attracted a PT in a silique (overgrowth per silique, OG/S). We found a striking variation in the ability to recognize interspecific PTs between different A. thaliana accessions, with OG/S ranging from about 10 to 90% (Fig. 1d, broad-sense heritability H2=0.7). Examples of accessions with extreme phenotypes are Lz-0 (10% OG/S, n=12 siliques) and Kz-9 (87.3% OG/S, n=10; Fig. 1e,f). There is no obvious correlation between the geographical origin of the accessions and their phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 3).. To analyse whether the variation in the ability to recognize interspecific PTs is species-dependent, we pollinated a subset of A. thaliana accessions with low or high OG/S in crosses with A. lyrata (Lz-0, Kas-1, Ga-0, Lp2-6 and Col-0, Kz-1, Nd-1, respectively) also with pollen of A. halleri and A. arenosa. Although OG/S in the accessions pollinated with A. lyrata or A. halleri pollen was highly comparable (Fig. 2a,b), the values were slightly lower for all accessions when pollinated by A. arenosa (Fig. 2c), indicating that A. thaliana recognizes A. arenosa PTs better than those of A. lyrata or A. halleri. However, accessions showing very low or high OG/S in crosses with A. lyrata, respectively, displayed a similar phenotype with A. halleri and A. arenosa as pollen donors, suggesting a common molecular PT reception mechanism for all three species. Thus, PT overgrowth is a hallmark of interspecific crosses with close Brassicaceae relatives and not a species-specific feature of A. thaliana and A. lyrata.. To investigate whether intraspecific PT reception was affected in accessions with high OG/S (Col-0, Kz-1, Kz-9, Nd-1, Fei-0, and Sq-8), we crossed them with A. thaliana pollen (from both low and high OG/S accessions). Intraspecific PT reception was normal in all the tested accessions (Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that high OG/S frequencies result from a failure in the recognition of interspecific PTs only, and are not due to a general defect in PT reception.. . . ARTUMES regulates inter- but not intraspecific PT reception. To identify loci causing the variation in interspecific PT reception in A. thaliana, we used publicly available single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from the 86 accessions to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS)27. To date, most GWAS in Arabidopsis have identified previously known candidate genes, with only a few studies identifying novel regulatory genes in the respective pathways2829. Applying the GLM function implemented in TASSEL30, we identified a region on chromosome 1 containing 8 of the top 20 SNPs with the highest correlation to the OG/S trait (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2). This 28-kb region (positions 22,814,316 to 22,842,689) contains six genes and one pseudogene (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, calculation with mixed linear models that simultaneously correct for population structure and unequal genetic relatedness between individuals masked the peak, whereas it could be detected-although below the significance threshold-using a step-wise multi-locus mixed model (MLMM) specifically designed for mapping complex traits31 (Supplementary Fig. 4). With each step of MLMM, new peaks appear, consistent with a multigenic basis for interspecific PT reception.. To narrow down the 28-kb candidate region to a single gene, we analysed OG/S in T-DNA insertion lines of three synergid-expressed genes32 in this region because the synergids control PT reception (At1g61780, At1g61790 and At1g61810; as well as At1g61795, for which no expression data was available; Supplementary Fig. 5). In a homozygous T-DNA insertion allele disrupting the coding sequence of At1g61790 (Fig. 4a), an average of 84.3% (n=18 siliques) of ovules display A. lyrata PT overgrowth, significantly more than in the Col-0 wild-type control (58.7% OG/S, n=28, Student's t-test P<0.001, Fig. 4b,d,e). We named the At1g61790 gene, which has previously been described as OST3/6 based on homology24, ARTUMES (ARU) after the Etruscan goddess of night, nature, and fertility33. The T-DNA allele was denoted aru-1. A second mutant allele, aru-2, carrying an EMS-induced premature stop-codon after aa residue 129 (ref. 34), also showed an increase in interspecific OG/S (96.1%, n=20, Fig. 4a,b,f). Likewise, aru-1 mutants pollinated with A. arenosa pollen showed significantly more ovules with PT overgrowth (67.6% OG/S, n=8) than the wild type (34.9% OG/S, n=12, Student's t-test P<0.001, Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting a common basis for interspecific PT recognition. In contrast, aru mutant ovules have no problem recognizing and receiving intraspecific PTs from A. thaliana (Fig. 4c,g), indicating that the PT reception pathway is fully functional within the species.. To confirm that ARU function is required for interspecific PT recognition in the synergids, we expressed an ARU-GFP translational fusion protein under the control of the MYB98 and FERONIA promoters (pMYB98::ARU-GFP and pFER::ARU-GFP) in aru-1 mutants. These promoters are highly active in synergids1335, and in ovules the strongest ARU-GFP signal was detected in these cells (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 7). ARU-GFP localized to perinuclear structures resembling the ER in synergids (Fig. 5a, inset), and co-localized with an ER-marker in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells (Supplementary Fig. 7). These results are consistent with the previously reported ER-localization of ARU-GFP in infiltrated tobacco leaves24. Mutant aru-1 plants expressing a functional copy of ARU-GFP in their synergids displayed wild-type-like PT reception in interspecific crosses (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating that ARU expression in synergid cells is sufficient to complement the aru mutant phenotype. Consistent with this, the ARU-GFP translational fusion protein driven by the endogenous promoter (pARU::ARU-GFP) is highly expressed in wild-type synergids (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting an important role for ARU in these cells. Functional complementation of the aru-1 mutant was also observed when ARU was driven by the endogenous promoter in a construct also containing 865bp downstream sequence (pARU::ARU), although there was more line-to-line variability than when the pMYB98 promoter was used (Supplementary Fig. 7). Since ARU is not fused to a fluorescent tag here, technical difficulties in measuring synergid specific expression of the transgene make it hard to explore this difference experimentally. However, it is conceivable that additional regulatory sequences, up- or downstream of the ARU coding sequence that are present in the pARU::ARU construct but not in pMYB98::ARU-GFP or pFER::ARU-GFP, contributed to the observed phenotypic variability.. . . SNPs around ARTUMES correlate with phenotypic variation. We assessed the correlation of amino acid differences in the ARU coding sequence in all accessions to determine whether differences in the protein sequence could explain the phenotypic variation. Within this population, we detected a total of 10 amino acid differences, four of which are significantly correlated to variation in OG/S (Pearson's correlation coefficient R, P<0.05, Supplementary Data 1). However, differing residues had similar chemical properties, implying small, if any, differences in protein function. Alternatively, differential expression levels could cause the observed phenotypic variation. Therefore, we examined alignments of 1,000bp up- and downstream sequence of ARU. We found 9 of 49 and 39 of 79 upstream and downstream SNPs, respectively, to be correlated with phenotypic variation (P<0.05, Supplementary Data 1), suggesting that phenotypic variation could be due to differences in gene expression. To investigate this further, we used RNA extracts from pistils and ovules collected 2 days after emasculation from selected accessions (Lz-0, Kas-1, Ga-0 and Col-0, Nd-1, Fei-0, Kz-1, Kz-9) for quantitative real-time PCR and digital droplet PCR, respectively36. We found ARU mRNA levels differed between accessions (Supplementary Fig. 8), but they did not correlate with the OG/S phenotype among the selected set of accessions. Because we used RNA from whole pistils and ovules, we cannot exclude the possibility that ARU is differentially expressed in synergids only, where it is required and sufficient for interspecific PT reception. In addition, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression could play a role in mediating ARU protein levels. ARU has a 410bp long 3-UTR (3-untranslated region)37 containing 17 SNPs that are correlated with the OG/S phenotype and might contribute to accession-specific differences in ARU protein levels.. To further investigate the role of ARU in different accessions, we transformed high OG/S accessions (Fei-0, Kz-1, Kz-9) with pMYB98::ARU-GFP to ensure strong expression in synergid cells and assessed interspecific PT reception in these lines. Of several independent transformants of all accessions, none showed a significant reduction of OG/S (Supplementary Fig. 8), which would be expected if low expression of ARU alone would be the cause of impaired interspecific PT reception in these accessions. Similarly, the ARU allele (including 1,492bp up- and 865bp downstream sequence) from Ga-0 could not better complement the aru mutant-which is in the Col-0 background-than the Col-0 allele, as it would be expected if differences in ARU alone caused the phenotypic difference between Ga-0 and Col-0 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Although these experiments could not establish a mechanistic link between variation in ARU and variation in OG/S, they are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that ARU is differentially regulated in A. thaliana accessions. Because ARU is likely only one of several factors involved in interspecific PT reception, we cannot rule out that crucial epistatic interactions with other factors were missing in the particular accessions we tested. At present, it is conceivable that population structure or co-segregating SNPs, which do not directly influence ARU expression or protein function, caused the GWAS peak on chromosome 1 and that ARU itself-although undoubtedly involved in interspecific PT reception-is not responsible for the observed natural variation among the 86 accessions tested. We consider co-segregating SNPs a highly unlikely explanation, however, because mutations disrupting other genes in the region identified by GWAS did not show a phenotype in interspecific crosses with A. lyrata pollen.. . . Signatures of selection at the ARTUMES locus. Genes involved in reproductive isolation and speciation are often subject to selective pressures driving rapid divergence38. We tested ARU plus 1,000bp up- and downstream sequence for signatures of positive selection by estimating Tajima's D39 for a set of 96 A. thaliana accessions40, including all accessions used in this study. A negative D is due to an excess of low frequency polymorphisms that can be caused by positive selection on the locus or by population expansion. Tajima's D was -2.07 for the 1,000bp upstream of the translation start, -1.57 for the coding sequence and -1.58 for the 1,000bp downstream of the ARU stop-codon. All values significantly deviate from the neutral model (P<0.05), but do not fall into the 5% tail of the estimated genomic distribution of D in A. thaliana40 (cut-off value: -2.08). Thus, although the 1,000bp upstream region was very close to this cut-off, the observed negative values might be influenced by demographic factors that shaped the entire genome rather than selective pressure acting on the ARU locus. In addition, we estimated Fay and Wu's H, another test statistic to detect positive selection41, which is not as sensitive to demographic factors as Tajima's D42. All values for H were strongly negative (upstream region: -20.20, coding sequence: -21.79, downstream region: -20.73, P<0.02), and fall into the very extreme tails of both an empirical and a simulated distribution of H calculated with 12 accessions, which represent a world-wide distribution and are a subset of the accessions used in this study42. Such strongly negative values for H indicate that positive selection may indeed have acted on each of the regions of the ARU locus. The fact that D for the upstream region was very close to the 5% tail and the strongly negative values for H provide evidence for possible positive selection and indicate that ARU may have undergone a recent selective sweep. This is consistent with the lack of variation in ARU amino acid sequence and expression level but is difficult, although not impossible, to reconcile with the fact that we identified ARU in a GWAS for variation in the OG/S phenotype. As pointed out above, this may be due to epistatic interactions with additional factors involved in this complex process. Nevertheless, as in animal speciation genes, selective pressures appear to have contributed to shaping the genetic basis that underlies interspecific PT reception in A. thaliana.. . . Interspecific PT reception depends on protein N-glycosylation. ARU encodes the OST3/6 subunit of the hetero-oligomeric plant oligosaccharyltransferase complex (OST), which catalyses the co- or posttranslational transfer of pre-assembled carbohydrate oligomers (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) to asparagine (N) residues of polypeptides43. N-glycosylation affects the substrate protein's folding, targeting, and/or processing through the ER. Subsequently, the N-linked glycan can be modified in the Golgi apparatus in a cell-type and species-specific manner, accounting for the functionality and binding specificity of the glycoprotein43. The yeast OST consists of eight subunits and the homologues of OST3/6, Ost3p and Ost6p, differ in their protein substrate and site-specific glycosylation efficiency2223.. In plants, OST3/6 confers similar substrate specificity since in the A. thaliana ost3/6 (aru) mutant only a subset of glycoproteins is misglycosylated and therefore non-functional24. Among these are the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptor kinase EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR), and KORRIGAN1, an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase involved in cellulose biosynthesis. In line with this, aru has previously been identified in an EMS-screen for cell wall mutants34. Some of the known members in the PT reception pathway, FER and NTA, have been implicated in the perception of cell wall perturbations, pathogen resistance, and innate immunity174445. After pollination with A. lyrata, fer heterozygous mutants show higher OG/S (74.9%) than wild-type segregants (61.2%, P<0.01, Supplementary Fig. 9), suggesting that inter- and intraspecific PT reception both involve the FER pathway. Moreover, FER (a receptor-like kinase with an extracellular malectin-binding domain) and LRE (a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein) are likely to be glycosylated131646 and could be substrates of ARU. To test this, we analysed the expression and localization of fluorescent FER and LRE fusion proteins in aru ovules. We included NTA, which itself does not contain any putative glycosylation sites but whose subcellular localization depends on FER signalling17. All fusion proteins displayed a wild-type-like subcellular localization in the synergids of aru embryo sacs: FER-GFP and LRE-Citrine were observed at the micropylar end of the synergids, and NTA-GFP was re-localized there upon PT arrival (Supplementary Fig. 10). These results indicate that, in the absence of functional ARU, these proteins are properly targeted to their subcellular compartment. However, we cannot rule out that the extracellular domain of FER is un- or misglycosylated at specific glycosylation sites in aru, which may allow the protein to recognize intra- but not interspecific PTs.. The synergid has a specialized secretory region at its micropylar end, the filiform apparatus, which contains a large amount of secreted material and is believed to be the site of PT recognition6. It is possible that even subtle differences in ARU protein levels could lead to the misglycosylation of target proteins, including FER, such that a few specific glycosylation sites remain unglycosylated. Given the high secretory activity of the filiform apparatus, such small changes could have a large effect on PT reception. Further work will be necessary to shed more light on the target proteins of ARU and to elucidate the role of specific glycosylated surface proteins in PT reception..
PMC3566969	Results. Using RNA-Seq, we compare the transcriptomes of wild-type and hae hsl2 stage 15 flowers, using the floral receptacle which is enriched for abscission zone cells. 2034 genes were differentially expressed with a False Discovery Rate adjusted p < 0.05, of which 349 had two fold or greater change in expression. Differentially expressed genes were enriched for hydrolytic, cell wall modifying, and defense related genes. Testing several of the differentially expressed genes in INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (ida) mutants shows that many of the same genes are co-regulated by IDA and HAE HSL2 and support the role of IDA in the HAE and HSL2 signaling pathway. Comparison to microarray data from stamen abscission zones show distinct patterns of expression of genes that are dependent on HAE HSL2 and reveal HAE HSL2- independent pathways..
PMC4566987	Results. . . AtMYB74 is induced by salt stress and overexpression lines are hypersensitive to salt stress during seed germination. Transcriptome analysis revealed that AtMYB74 expression level in Arabidopsis was increased dramatically by NaCl treatments. To determine the biological function of AtMYB74 and to test the responses to NaCl, overexpression (OE) and RNAi transgenic Arabidopsis lines were generated. In the T3 generation, two independent OE lines and two independent RNAi lines were selected for further experiment (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of AtMYB74 also induced the expression of a set of known stress marker genes, including AtRD29B, AtRAB18, and AtRD20, all of which contain the conserved MYB recognition sites (TAACTG) in their promoter regions (Fig. 1B). These observations suggest that AtMYB74 acts as a transcription factor of the salt stress-induced marker genes involved in the salt signalling pathway. Under normal growth conditions, the germination rates of both the OE and RNAi lines were almost the same as those of WT plants, which all achieved rates of 100% at day 2 (Fig. 1C). However, after NaCl treatment, the germination of OE transgenic seeds was inhibited more severely than that of WT seeds, reaching 80% at day 7, when the germination of WT seeds reached almost 100%. The germination rates of RNAi transgenic seeds were similar to those of WT seeds (Fig. 1D). In addition, for 21-day-old seedlings, the percentage seedling survival of OE transgenic lines was much lower than that of WT and RNAi plants under salt stress conditions (Fig. 1E). The reduced germination rates and seedling survival of the OE lines further indicate that AtMYB74 is involved in the response to salt stress in plants.. . Fig. 1.. .

The full-length cDNA corresponding to the AtMYB74 mRNA is 975bp in length and encodes a putative protein of 324 amino acids. The R2 and R3 MYB domains (amino acids 13-65 and 66-117, respectively) of AtMYB74 are highly conserved with all other MYB proteins in Arabidopsis and in other plant species (Fig. 2A).. . Fig. 2.. .

Scale bars = 20 mum. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . To describe the temporal and spatial expression patterns of AtMYB74 in greater detail, qRT-PCR and promoter-GUS analysis were performed. The highest number of AtMYB74 transcripts was found in flowers, followed by rosette leaves and cauline leaves, with the roots, stems, and siliques exhibiting the fewest transcripts (Fig. 2B). The tissue pattern of GUS staining was consistent with the qRT-RCR analysis (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that AtMYB74 is constitutively expressed in various tissues at low abundance.. To detect the subcellular localization of the AtMYB74 protein in plant cells, the AtMYB74 coding region was fused in the frame to the coding region for the C-terminal side of GFP under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Onion epidermal cells transformed with an expression plasmid for the AtMYB74-GFP fusion protein exhibited GFP fluorescence in the nucleus (Fig. 2D). However, GFP fluorescence was observed in the entire region of the cell when intact GFP was expressed. These results illustrate that AtMYB74 is localized in the nucleus.. . . Dynamic DNA methylation results in AtMYB74 activation in response to salt stress. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that substantial DNA methylation and siRNA target sites exist in the AtMYB74 promoter region (http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome/epigenome.html; http://bioinfo.uni-plovdiv.bg/starpro/). To investigate whether the RdDM pathway regulates AtMYB74 responses to salt stress, qRT-PCR was used to compare the expression of AtMYB74 in WT Col-0, 5-azaC (an inhibitor of DNA methylation)-treated WT, ddc (drm1/drm2/cmt3 triple mutant), dcl3 (dicer-like 3 mutant), rdr2 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 mutant), ros1-4 (ros1 mutant), and rdd (ros1/dml2/dml3 triple mutant) in response to 150mM NaCl treatment. As shown in Fig. 3A, the level of AtMYB74 transcripts increased significantly (~8-fold) in response to NaCl treatment in WT plants, indicating that AtMYB74 responds to salt stress signals at the transcriptional level. Additionally, the GUS staining assay confirmed that NaCl could enhance AtMYB74 promoter activity in all tested tissues (Fig. 2C). WT plants treated with 5-azaC, which were used as a control, exhibited a small increase in AtMYB74 expression under salt stress, indicating the effect of DNA methylation on AtMYB74 (Fig. 3A). Besides DNA methylation, this result may suggest the presence of other minor factors that may control the expression of AtMYB74. For RdDM mutants, the accumulation of AtMYB74 mRNA in methylation mutants (ddc, rdr2, and dcl3) showed much less change than that in WT plants under salt stress, whereas the deficiency of active DNA demethylation in ros1-4 and rdd mutants resulted in an obvious decrease in AtMBY74 expression after salt treatment (Fig. 3A). These results reveal that dynamic DNA methylation results in AtMYB74 activation in response to salt stress in Arabidopsis.. . Fig. 3.. . Analysis of AtMYB74 expression and promoter DNA methylation. (A) Transcript levels of AtMYB74 in 14-day-old WT, 5-azaC treated WT, ddc, dcl3, rdr2, ros1, and rdd mutants after 150mM NaCl treatment for 24h. Results were normalized to the expression of tubulin. Error bars represent SD (n = 3). ** and *** indicate statistically significant differences at P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively (Students t-test). (B-D) Bisulphite sequencing analysis of promoter methylation status of AtMYB74 promoter in 14-day-old seedlings after 150mM NaCl treatment for 24h. Twenty individual clones were sequenced to determine the methylation status of a locus in each genotype. (E) Bisulphite sequencing and qRT-PCR to detect the DNA methylation and expression of AtMYB74 was at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24h after 150mM NaCl treatment.. . . . To further understand the mechanism by which RdDM regulates AtMYB74 expression, the 200bp promoter region approximately 500bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of AtMYB74 was analysed by bisulphite sequencing. WT plants treated with NaCl exhibited a visible reduction in total 5-methylcytosine content compared with controls (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Fig. S2). Interestingly, the percentage of CHH methylation was nearly halved in the treated WT plants (Fig. 3C), whereas only ~10% reduction in CG contexts was detected (Fig. 3D). No CHG contexts were found in the 200bp region. Moreover, fewer methylated sites in CHH contexts were observed in the RdDM mutants and pharmaceutically treated plants, whether under salt stress or not. Additionally, the three DNA demethylases might not participate in the demethylation of CHH sites in the AtMYB74 promoter region. The reduction of AtMYB74 expression in ros1-4 and rdd mutants under salt stress might be regulated by its upstream regulators, which are affected by the demethylases (Fig. 3A, C). These findings suggest that the dynamic balance of DNA methylation and demethylation is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of AtMYB74.. . Time-course analysis revealed that the level of AtMYB74 mRNA under salt stress showed a peak from 0.5h, with the highest levels at 3h, accompanied by the lowest percentage of CHH methylation. After 6h, AtMYB74 expression under salt stress maintained a high level (~7-fold) in treated plants compared with that in the controls, and a lower percentage of CHH methylation was maintained in WT plants (Fig. 3E). These results demonstrate that the increase of AtMYB74 transcripts was correlated with the lower level of CHH methylation during the NaCl treatment, suggesting that the stress-increased expression of AtMYB74 resulted from a reduction in dynamic DNA methylation, mainly in the CHH context.. . . Decreased DNA methylation is controlled by the level of 24-nt siRNAs targeting the AtMYB74 promoter. To investigate why CHH hypomethylation occurs in WT plants under salt stress, a sequence analysis of AtMYB74 was performed using starPRO DB v1.0 (http://bioinfo.uni-plovdiv.bg/starpro/). Five 24-nt siRNAs (ASRP215119, ASRP41948, ASRP27256, ASRP13208, and ASRP2423) were identified to target a narrow region (-603 to -477bp) of the 2.9kb promoter of AtMYB74. These five 24-nt siRNAs were located in a cluster in the promoter region (Fig. 4A). Moreover, bisulphite sequencing analysis of individual clones showed that DNA methylation considerably changed in or near the siRNA target region (Fig. 4B). However, no obvious changes were detected in 5-azaC-treated WT or RdDM mutants (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that CHH hypomethylation is dependent on RdDM in or near the siRNA target region.. .

(D) Northern blot analysis of the NaCl-induced regulation of five 24-nt siRNAs targeting the AtMYB74 promoter. miR171 and U6 RNA were probed as a control. Numbers under each lane indicate relative expression.. . . . To reveal the role of the siRNAs in RdDM, siRNA qRT-PCR and northern blot analysis were performed. The accumulation of five 24-nt siRNAs was substantially reduced under salt stress in WT plants compared with that in dcl3 plants (Fig. 4C, D), suggesting that decreases in DNA methylation caused by the reductions in 24-nt siRNA accumulation lead to the activation of AtMYB74 under salt stress.. . . Exogenous 24-nt siRNAs direct RdDM in the AtMYB74 promoter in vivo. . To demonstrate whether the ectopic expression of 24-nt siRNAs affects AtMYB74 promoter activity, A. tumefaciens-mediated transient cotransformation in tobacco (N. benthamiana) leaves was performed. Considering that the siRNAs diced from the hairpin RNA could induce transcriptional silencing of the target genes, two types of expression cassettes were constructed to generate siRNAs and express the reporter gene (Fig. 5A). For siRNA expression cassettes in pFGC5941, the 300bp AtMYB74 promoter containing the siRNA target region that harbors an inverted DNA repeat was used to generate a double-strand RNA as a silencer (R1). A 300bp inverted cDNA sequence of AtMYB74 was employed as a control (R2). In the reporter gene cassettes of pBI121, gusA was driven by the 35S promoter (P1), AtMYB74 promoter (P2), and mutated AtMYB74 promoter with the deletion of a 200bp region where these siRNAs are targeted (P3). As shown in Fig. 5B, GUS activities between groups P1 and P1-R1, P2 and P2-R2, and P2 and P3-R1 did not show obvious changes after transient cotransformation. The GUS activity of group P2-R1 was obviously lower than that of group P2, indicating that promoter activity is affected by the targeted siRNA. In addition, bisulphite sequencing analysis revealed that DNA methylation in the 200bp promoter region increased by 43% due to the siRNAs yielded by the hairpin RNA (Fig. 5C, D). To confirm the accumulation of 24-nt siRNAs in the infection zones of transformed leaves, siRNA northern blot analysis was carried out. The constructs R1, P1-R1, P2-R1, and P3-R1 could efficiently generate siRNAs in the transformed tobacco (Fig. 5E). Overall, these findings demonstrate that the ectopic expression of artificial siRNAs targeting the AtMYB74 promoter also can regulate GUS expression through RdDM.. . Fig. 5.. .

PMC2736885	Results. . AtTRP1 is a single copy gene in Arabidopsis. AtTRP1 (At4g30480) was identified by its homology to tomato SlTPR1, a TPR motif-containing protein that interacts with some tomato ethylene receptors and modulates both ethylene and auxin responses during development (Lin et al., 2008b). The AtTRP1 coding sequence was isolated by RT-PCR using primers AtTPR1F/R (Fig. 1A). The AtTRP1 gene is 1766 bp in length and contains five exons (Fig. 1B) that encode a putative 277 aa protein with three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs (Fig. 1C). At the amino acid level AtTRP1 has overall 64% identity and 72% similarity to SlTPR1 (data not shown; Lin et al., 2008b). There are also two splicing variants of AtTRP1 with early stop codons resulting in two truncated putative proteins of 209 aa and 162 aa respectively, which eliminate one or all TPR motifs (Fig. 1C).. AtTRP1 is a single copy gene in the Arabidopsis genome, although a large number of genes encode proteins containing TPR1 motifs. A phylogenetic tree analysis using the full-length protein sequences of 91 TPR genes from the Arabidopsis genome as entry indicated AtTRP1 is distantly related to a group of immunophilin FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), such as TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1), PASTICCINO1 (PAS1), ROF1 and 2 (Geisler et al., 2003; Smyczynski et al., 2006) (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online, boxed). In addition to the C-terminal TPRs, FKBPs have N-terminal FKBP domains that are absent in the AtTRP1 protein. FKBPs belong to the superfamily of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) and catalyse the cis-trans isomerization of cis-prolyl bonds. Mammalian FKBPs have been identified as targets of immunosuppressant drugs and are therefore classified as immunophilins. AtTRP1 has most similarity to TWD1 and PAS1 (Fig. 2A). TWD1 contains one FKBP domain in its N-terminus, three TPRs from aa 170-288, and a transmembrane domain in the C-terminal, which is absent in the AtTRP1 protein (Fig. 2B). AtTRP1 shares 48% identity with TWD1 at the DNA level (see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online) and 47% similarity at the amino acid level over the C-terminus that contains the TPR motifs (Fig. 2B, C). TWD1 is plasma membrane-anchored and has been shown to interact physically with the multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters PGP1 and PGP19, and to control PGP-mediated auxin transport (Bouchard et al., 2006). Mutation in this gene resulted in twisted dwarf plants (Bouchard et al., 2006). PAS1 contains triple FKBP domains (Fig. 2B) and is involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation during plant development. Mutations in the C-terminal region of PAS1 result in severe developmental defects. The C-terminal region of PAS1 controls the subcellular distribution of the protein and is required for interaction with FAN (FKBP-associated NAC), a new member of the plant-specific family of NAC transcription factors. PAS1 and FAN are translocated into the nucleus upon auxin treatment in plant seedlings (Smyczynski et al., 2006). AtTRP1, like SlTPR1 (Lin et al., 2008b), is also closely related to the human protein TTC1 (Fig. 2), which links G-proteins and Ras signalling in mammalian cells and competes with Raf-1 for Ras-binding (Marty et al., 2003).. . Fig. 2.. . Comparison of AtTRP1 and related genes.

AtTRP1 mRNA was highly expressed in leaves, stems, and flowers. Northern analysis using the full-length AtTRP1 cDNA as probe indicated that AtTRP1 mRNA was consistently highly expressed in all stages of developing flowers, i.e. unopened, early-opened, fully-opened, and senescing flowers, stems, and leaves (including emerging, mature, and senescing leaves), but was absent or present at a low level in siliques (Fig. 3).. .

The ethidium bromide-stained rRNA gel below indicates the sample loading.. . . . . . AtTRP1 promoter-GUS was highly expressed in vascular tissue, anther and pollen, abscission zone, and induced by exogenous ACC. In order to understand the regulation of the AtTRP1 gene, the AtTRP1 promoter (-1 to -600) was fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and transformed to Arabidopsis (Materials and methods). Histochemical analysis of the T1 plants revealed that the AtTRP1 promoter-GUS construct was predominantly expressed in the vascular tissue (Fig. 4A, B), mature anther (Fig. 4C, D), and pollen (Fig. 4E, arrow), the abscission zone (Fig. 3F), and funiculus of mature seeds (Fig. 3G). AtTRP1 promoter-GUS was induced in seedlings grown in medium containing ACC (Fig. 3H, I), but was not affected by exogenous IAA (data not shown).. . Fig. 4.. . AtTRP1 promoter-GUS reporter analysis. AtTRP1 promoter-GUS was expressed in vascular tissue of 12-d-old light-grown seedlings (A), senescent leaves (B), and in the anthers of mature flowers (C, D). (E) A high magnification image of a squashed mature anther, showing pollen. (F) AtTRP1 promoter-GUS was expressed in the abscission zone of a developing silique during sepal and petal senescence (fallen sepals and petals not shown). (G) Comparison of AtTRP1 promoter-GUS expression in a mature (left) and a ripe silique (right), the latter showing strong GUS expression in the abscission zones. (H, I) AtTRP1 promoter-GUS was expressed more strongly in seedlings grown in medium containing ACC (H) in the light (10-d-old) and (I) in the dark (3-d-old).. . . . Cis-element analysis of the AtTRP1 promoter sequence indicated putative binding sites for known mammalian transcription factors with high score and frequency (see Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online), including SRY (sex-determining region Y gene product) and CdxA (chicken homeobox transcription factor) (Pontiggia et al., 1994; Margalit et al., 1993). SRY is a member of the high mobility group, which initiates male sex determination in mammals (Lovell-Badge, 1993); whereas CdxA is expressed in the epiblast and the early endodermal lineage and may play an important role during the early steps of organogenesis (Frumkin et al., 1991).. . . Overexpression of the full-length AtTRP1 in Arabidopsis resulted in dramatic developmental abnormality in plant morphology and reproduction. To examine whether or not AtTRP1 possessed similar functions to the tomato orthologue SlTPR1 in planta, two constructs for overexpression of AtTRP1, named as AtTRP1F-GFP and AtTRP1N-GFP, respectively, were made using the full-length coding cDNA (nt 1-831) and a partial cDNA (nt 1-648) encoding the N-terminal protein (equivalent to the splicing variant 2; Fig. 1) under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter, each with a downstream GFP tag in vector pK7FWG2 (Karimi et al., 2002) (Fig. 5A; see Supplementary Fig. S3A at JXB online). This would be expected to lead to overexpression in cells and tissues that normally produced AtTRP1 mRNA (Fig. 3), plus ectopic expression in other cells. The two constructs, after confirmation by sequencing, were independently transformed into Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia. Twenty-four independent transgenic lines overexpressing the partial AtTRP1 cDNA (the AtTRP1N-GFP construct) were selected on kanamycin medium and grown to maturity. Northern analysis and subcellular localization of the AtTRP1N-GFP fusion protein confirmed the transgene expression (see Supplementary Fig. S3B at JXB online), but none of these lines displayed any phenotypic alteration under normal growth conditions (data not shown).. .

(E) Leaf morphology of the transgenic plants in comparison with the control. Leaves from the transgenic lines were smaller and rounder with shorter pedicels. (F) Flower morphology: flowers from the transgenic plants produced twisted, shorter and wider siliques, and an elongated zone at the base was clearly seen. (G) Phenotypes of inflorescences: the transgenic stalks (2, 3) produced fewer flowers compared with the wild type (Col). (H) Morphology of mature siliques. Siliques from the transgenic plants were much shorter and wider with fewer seeds and an elongated structure between the pedicel and the fruit.. . . . To investigate whether silencing AtTRP1 caused phenotypic affects, a T-DNA insertion line (NASC ID: N449203), which has an insertion in the beginning of the third exon of AtTRP1 was screened, but no phenotypic changes were observed in normal growth conditions (data not shown).. Six independent transgenic lines overexpressing the full-length AtTRP1 sequence fused to GFP (AtTRP1F-GFP) were selected on kanamycin and Northern analysis confirmed expression of the transgene (Fig. 5B). All lines (T1 generation) exhibited noticeably reduced stature, and appeared bushy with small rounded leaves and reduced flower numbers. The severity of the phenotype was related to the levels of the transgene expression (Fig. 5B, C). Overexpression of AtTRP1F-GFP at high levels in planta affected fertility, with reduced size and number of inflorescences and flowers. The flowers were often asymmetrically arranged and smaller compared to the wild type (Fig. 5F, G). Siliques were wider, shorter, and misshapen with reduced numbers of seeds, and often had elongated narrow regions at their proximal and distal ends (Fig. 5F, H). Line 2 with the strongest transgene expression was tiny, senesced earlier, and produced only a few seeds (Fig. 5B, D; see Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). Line 3 (also with strong transgene expression) was only able to produce heterozygous and not homozygous seeds (see Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online; data not shown), and other lines displayed intermediate phenotypes (Fig. 5; see Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online).. . . AtTRP1 overexpressers displayed enhanced responses to exogenous ACC. The ethylene responses of the transgenic seedlings that overexpressed AtTRP1F-GFP were investigated. Seeds from lines 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Fig. 5B, C) were grown on MS medium with or without 0.5 muM ACC in the dark or light (Fig. 6). Line 4 did not germinate well. In the dark, lines 2 and 3 displayed great growth inhibition, with shortened and swollen hypocotyls (2-3 mm versus 9 mm in the wild type; Table 1), inhibited root growth, and altered apical hook in the absence of ACC, although lines 5 and 6 displayed normal growth (Fig. 6A, B). Etiolated seedlings from all lines exhibited enhanced responses to 0.5 muM ACC, with shortened roots and hypocotyls and altered apical hook, and hypocotyls of lines 2 and 3 were swollen (Fig. 6A, C, which shows an enlarged image of line 3 in response to 0.5 muM ACC; Table 1). In the light, seedlings of all transgenic lines exhibited a reduction in cotyledon expansion and greening in the absence of ACC, and enhanced responses to 0.5 muM ACC, with a great reduction in root length compared to the wild type (Fig. 6D; Table 2). Taken together, both dark- and light-grown AtTRP1 overexpressing seedlings showed enhanced responses to low concentration of exogenous ACC, although the seedlings did not always display swollen hypocotyls or exaggerated apical hooks.. .

Wild-type and transgenic seedlings were grown on MS medium with or without 0.5 muM ACC in the dark and photographed in white light under an Olympus microscope at 3-d-old. (B) Enlarged images of the apical hooks of wild type (Col) and lines 2 and 3 from (A) grown in the absence of ACC. (C) Enlarged image of line 3 in response to ACC from (A), showing shortened and swollen hypocotyls and inhibited root growth. (D) Responses of light-grown seedlings to ACC. Wild-type and transgenic seedlings were grown on MS medium with or without 0.5 muM ACC in the light and photographed at 7-d-old.. . . . The response to ACC of the transgenic plants overexpressing the AtTRP1 N-terminal construct was also examined, although, as described above, they showed no visible phenotypic changes in the normal growth condition (i.e they were not dwarfed and showed no morphological changes). Seeds from lines 5, 6, 8, 16, and 18 were grown on MS medium with or without 0.5 muM ACC in the dark. Transgenic seedlings from all lines displayed enhanced responses to ACC to some extent, with shortened hypocotyls and roots, and an exaggerated apical hook, although in the absence of ACC they showed no difference to the wild type (see Supplementary Fig. S8 at JXB online).. To clarify whether growth inhibition displayed by the transgenic lines was due to the overproduction of ethylene or the disruption of signalling, the expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes ACS5 and 9 and the ethylene responsive gene AtChiB was examined by Northern analysis. The results showed no detectable alteration in the levels of ACS5 and 9 mRNA, but increased expression of AtChitB in the transgenic lines compared to the wild type (see Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online). The AtChitB mRNA has been shown to be induced by ethephon, a compound that is converted to ethylene by plants (Samac et al., 1990), and to be up-regulated in the constitutive ethylene response mutant ctr1 (Kieber et al., 1993). Measurement of ethylene production by either light-grown or dark-grown seedlings also indicated no significant differences between the transgenic lines and the wild type (data not shown). Furthermore, the effects of the ethylene synthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) on the constitutive ethylene response phenotype of lines 2 and 3 (Fig. 6A, B) were also examined. Etiolated seedlings grown on 0.2 muM AVG still exhibited the reduced growth phenotype (Fig. 7A). Silver nitrate, which inhibits ethylene receptor action, also had no effect on the phenotype of the etiolated seedlings compared with seedlings grown on MS medium without the inhibitors (Fig. 7B), whereas the same concentrations of the inhibitor abolished the growth inhibition of the wild-type etiolated seedlings in the presence of ACC (Fig. 7C). These results suggested that altered growth responses caused by overexpression of AtTRP1 in planta were not related to enhanced ethylene synthesis but resulted from the disruption of signalling downstream of the ethylene receptors.. . Fig. 7.. . Response to ethylene inhibitors AVG and silver nitrate. (A) Etiolated seedlings of lines 2 and 3 grown on MS with or without the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor AVG (A) and the ethylene action inhibitor silver nitrate (B). Photographs of 3-d-old seedlings were taken under an Olympus microscope. (C) Etiolated wild-type seedlings were grown on MS, MS+0.5 muM ACC, and MS+0.5 muM ACC with ethylene inhibitor 0.2 muM AVG, or silver nitrate (50, 100, or 200 ppm), and photographed under an Olympus microscope at 3-d-old.. . . . . . Exogenous gibberellic acid (GA) did not alter the dwarfed phenotype of AtTRP1 overexpressors. To clarify whether the retarded growth of the transgenic plants overexpressing AtTRP1 resulted from defects in GA production, the responses to GA of the transgenic plants were investigated. Seeds from three dwarfed transgenic lines 3, 4, and 6 and the wild type were grown on MS medium in the absence or in the presence of 10 muM GA for 8 d and were then transferred to soil with continuous spraying and watering with 100 muM GA twice a week for 18 d in normal growth condition (see Materials and methods), and the phenotypic characteristics of the plants, including bolting time, height, flower numbers, side shoots, and leaf size, were measured. The results showed that GA did not reverse the dwarfed phenotypes of the transgenic plants overexpressing AtTRP1 (see Supplementary Fig. S6A, B at JXB online). This indicated that the growth retardation caused by overexpression of AtTRP1 in plants did not result from a deficiency in GA production.. . . Transgenic plants that overexpressed AtTRP1 displayed altered responses to IAA. In a previous study, it has been shown that overexpression of SlTPR1 in tomato resulted in auxin-related phenotypes and altered expression of some auxin early responsive genes (Lin et al., 2008b). The altered morphology of leaves and siliques and the bushy habit of the AtTRP1-overexpressing plants in the present experiments also suggested the possibility that AtTRP1 overexpression led to altered auxin responses. Expression of auxin early response genes IAA1, IAA5, and SAUR-AC1 was analysed by Northern analysis and showed a decrease in SAUR-AC1 and an increase in IAA5 (see Supplementary Fig. S7A at JXB online). Responses of the transgenic seedlings to exogenous IAA treatment were tested. Seeds from the transgenic lines 3, 4, 5, and 6 were grown on MS medium containing 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 muM IAA in the light. After 6 d, both the transgenic and wild-type seedlings exhibited no significant growth inhibition on 0.01 muM, but strong inhibition at 0.1 muM IAA (data not shown). AtTRP1 overexpressing seedlings, however, were less sensitive to intermediate levels (0.03 muM) of IAA compared to the wild type (see Supplementary Fig. S7 and Table S2 at JXB online).. . . Overexpressing AtTRP1 in the etr1-1 mutant resulted in alterations in leaf and silique morphology, but did not change the ethylene insensitivity of the mutant. To investigate the role of AtTRP1 in ethylene signalling and its relationship with the ethylene receptor AtETR1, the AtTRP1F-GFP construct was introduced into the dominant ETR1 receptor mutant etr1-1 (Bleecker et al., 1988; Chang et al., 1993) (referred to here as AtTRP1-in-etr1-1). Ten independent positive transgenic lines were obtained from two separate transformation events, and three lines (2, 4, and 5) were grown to maturity to produce seeds. Northern analysis confirmed expression of the transgene (Fig. 8A), and microscopic examination confirmed the AtTRP1-GFP fusion protein expression (data not shown). All three lines had smaller stature (T1 generation) (Fig. 8B), fewer rosette leaves (10 versus 13 at 22-d-old), and altered morphology of the rosette leaves and siliques compared with the etr1-1 mutant (Fig. 8B, C, D).. . Fig. 8.. . Characterization of the etr1-1 mutant plants overexpressing AtTRP1.

(C) Leaf morphology. Total rosette leaves were excised from the transgenic and wild-type plants at 22-d-old and photographed. Line 4 (lower) had 10, whereas etr1-1 (upper) had 13 leaves. (D) Silique morphology of the transgenic line (upper) and the wild-type (lower). (E) Lack of response of etiolated seedlings to ACC. Etr1-1 mutant and transgenic seedlings were grown on MS medium with or without 5 muM ACC in the dark and photographed under an Olympus microscope at 3-d-old.. . . . Ethylene sensitivity of AtTRP1-in-etr1-1 transgenic plants was examined. Seeds from the above transgenic lines and etr1-1 mutants were grown on MS medium with or without 5 muM ACC in the dark and light. The morphology of both etiolated etr1-1 and AtTRP1-in-etr-1.1 seedlings was not affected by 5 muM ACC, but AtTRP1-in-etr-1.1 seedlings were slightly shorter (Fig. 8E), which suggested that AtTRP1 has an ethylene-independent affect on cell elongation. Light-grown seedlings did not exhibit excessive root hair formation in the presence of ACC, a phenomenon stimulated by ethylene (data not shown). The results indicated that overexpression of AtTRP1 in the etr1-1 mutant did not change the ethylene insensitivity of the etr1-1 mutant although it altered the growth habit of the mutant in response to light, including reduced stature and leaf numbers and altered morphology of leaves and siliques (Fig. 8), suggesting that the dominant receptor mutation might mask AtTRP1 function related to ethylene sensitivity or the AtTRP1 protein might function independently or downstream of the ETR1 receptor.. . . AtTRP1 preferentially interacted with the ethylene receptor ERS1 in yeast. It was previously reported that SlTPR1 interacts with the tomato ethylene receptors NR and to a lesser extent to LeETR1 in a yeast two-hybrid system (Lin et al., 2008a). To determine whether or not AtTRP1 functions in the same way as SlTPR1, the interactions of AtTRP1 with ERS1 and ETR1, the two Arabidopsis orthologues of the tomato ethylene receptors NR and LeETR1, were tested using the LexA-based yeast two hybrid system (Lin et al., 2008b). The cDNAs encoding ERS1 or ETR1, without the transmembrane domain and the GAF domain, were inserted into the bait vector pEG202 (ERS1307-613, ETR1350-738), and the coding sequence of AtTRP1 (nt: 1-830) was cloned in the prey vector pJG4-5 (Fig. 8A, B). All the constructs were confirmed by sequencing prior to transforming into yeast. Each bait construct was transformed into yeast strain EGY48 containing the LacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34 and genetically integrated LEU2 reporter (Materials and methods). The suitability of the bait constructs was examined by testing their synthesis in yeast and the activation of the LacZ and LEU2 reporters prior to interaction assays (data not shown) (Lin et al., 2008c), and the prey construct AD-TRP1 and the prey vector pJG4-5 (as a negative control) were transformed with yeast containing each receptor construct. The interaction assays showed that AtTRP1 interacted with ERS1 and not with ETR1, whereas the prey vector pJG4-5 caused no interaction with either receptor (Fig. 9C). The interactions of AtTPR1 with the tomato ethylene receptors NR and LeETR1 were also examined. The NR partial cDNA encoding the NR protein without the transmembrane domain (NR117-635), together with the two partial cDNAs of LeETR1 encoding either the LeETR1 protein lacking the transmembrane domain (LeETR1132-754) or the histidine kinase domain alone (LeETR1364-647) were cloned into the bait vector pEG202 downstream of the LexA DNA-binding domain (DB) (Fig. 9B) (Lin et al., 2008c). All three tomato receptor constructs were shown to interact with AtTRP1 in yeast (Fig. 9C). The interactions of AtTRP1 with the ethylene receptors did not occur when yeast containing the combination of bait/prey constructs was grown on medium in the presence of glucose, which suppresses the expression of the prey protein AD-AtTRP1 (Fig. 9D).. .

(D) All the recombinants remained white when grown on medium containing glucose and X-gal (Glu/x-gal). P, positive control; N, negative control. (E) Top panel: western blot using anti-GFP to detect AtTRP1-GFP fusion protein in the total membrane protein fraction extracted from the transgenic (lines 3, 5, 6) and wild-type (Col) seedlings (15-d-old grown in the light in soil) or after immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody using total membrane proteins from the transgenic seedlings (pull-down) prior to electrophoresis. One band was detected with size 60 kDa corresponding to AtTRP1-GFP protein. Lower panel: western blot using anti-NR antibody to detect ERS1 in the same samples as the top panel. In the total membrane protein fraction two bands of 130 and 68 kDa corresponding to the homodimer or monomer of the ERS1 receptor were detected. After immunoprecipitation prior to electrophoresis only the larger band (130 kDa) corresponding to the size of the ERS1 homodimer was detected in the pull-dwon pellet, suggesting that AtTRP1 forms a complex with ERS1 dimers and not monomers.. . . . The association of AtTRP1 with the Arabidopsis ERS1 ethylene receptor in vivo was determined using the transgenic plants that overexpressed AtTRP1F-GFP. Membrane proteins were isolated from 15-d-old seedlings of the transgenic lines 3, 4, and 6 by ultracentrifugation at 100 000 g. The presence of the AtTRP1F-GFP fusion in membrane proteins from the transgenic plants was verified by western blotting using anti-GFP antibody, which detected a band corresponding to the AtTPR1-GFP fusion protein in all transgenic lines, but not in the wild type (Col) (Fig. 9E, top panel). In total membrane protein extracts, two NR antibody-reacting proteins were detected, with approximate molecular weights of 130 kDa and 68 kDa, indicating that the NR antibody recognized the ERS1 protein. These proteins corresponded to the known sizes of the homodimer and monomer of ERS1 (Fig. 9E, lower panel). The ERS1 protein has been shown to migrate as both homodimer and monomer proteins in SDS-PAGE without treatment with dithiothreitol (Hall et al., 2000). For co-immunoprecipitation analysis, the membrane proteins were pooled from all three transgenic lines and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody-protein A-magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Materials and methods). The protein complex from immunoprecipitation was bound to protein A-magnetic beads, washed, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and probed with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 9E, upper panel). When the immunoprecipitated samples were challenged with the anti-NR antibody, the results showed that the ERS1 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with the AtTPR1-GFP protein as homodimers and no monomers were detected (Fig. 9E, lower panel), which is consistent with AtTRP1 being associated with the ERS1 receptor in cell membranes in vivo.. . . AtTRP1 fluorescent tagged protein was localized in cell membranes and cytoplasm. The subcellular localization of AtTRP1 in planta was examined by confocal microscopy of leaf tissue from plants expressing AtTRP1F-GFP. The confocal images indicated that the fusion protein appeared to localize in the cell membranes, including plasma and nuclear membranes (Fig. 10A, C), which was consistent with the detection of the AtTRP1-GFP fusion protein in the membrane fractions (Fig. 9E, upper panel). The subcellular expression pattern of AtTRP1-GFP appeared different from an ER-targeted GFP protein. Plants expressing the ER-targeted GFP construct (kindly provided by Dr Ranjan Swarup from the University of Nottingham) produced a more diffuse pattern, with fluorescent images spread in the ER and possibly the plasma membrane (Fig. 10E), whereas plants expressing the AtTRP1-GFP construct produced a more pronounced fluorescence surrounding the nucleus and from the plasma membranes, suggesting that AtTRP1-GFP was likely to be located in these membranes (Fig. 10A, C), although the broad fluorescent areas surrounding the plasma and nuclear membranes suggested that the fusion protein might be localized in the cytoplasm.. .

(A-F) Young leaves from 2-week-old transgenic plants overexpressing AtTRP1F-GFP (A-D) or 35S-GFP (E, F) were examined under a confocal microscope. The AtTRP1-GFP fusion protein fluorescence was localized in the plasma and nuclear membranes, and probably cytoplasm as well (A shows an image of two mesophyll cells and two GARD cells; C shows the epidermal cells), while the ER-targeted GFP was more diffused in the ER and endomembrane system (E). (B, D, F) The fluorescence from chloroplasts of the same cells as (A), (C), and (E), respectively. (G) Western blot showed that AtTRP1-GFP fusion protein was detected in the membrane fraction and the soluble phase of the transgenic line 5 by anti-GFP antibody, but was not detected in the wild-type control. Col, wild-type control; 5, transgenic line 5.. . . . To verify whether the AtTRP1-GFP was also located in the cytosol, the membrane and soluble proteins were separated by ultracentrifugation of the total proteins extracted from the AtTRP1 overeexpressing line and the wild type, and were challenged with the anti-GFP antibody. The results indicated that the AtTRP1-GFP fusion protein was also detected in the soluble phase in addition to its detection in the membrane fraction (Fig. 10G) in the transgenic line. Therefore, the AtTRP1 protein was localized in the plasma and nuclear membranes as well as the cytoplasm, similar subcellular locations that were found for SlTPR1-GFP when the construct was transiently co-expressed with the NR receptor in the onion epidermal cells (Lin et al., 2008b)..
PMC3080859	Results. . PP2A Inhibition Increases ACS Activity. Ethylene biosynthesis is enhanced in dark-grown rcn1 seedlings [20], [22]. Because ACC synthesis is generally the rate-limiting step for ethylene production during vegetative growth, we asked whether ACS activity was increased in rcn1 mutant seedlings. We found that rcn1 mutants in both the Columbia (Col) and Wassilewskija (Ws) genetic backgrounds exhibited increased ACS enzymatic activities in dark-grown seedlings (Figure 2). In the Col genetic background, rcn1-6 and eto1 seedlings showed similar ACS activity levels. These data suggest that ethylene overproduction and reduced hypocotyl lengths in rcn1 mutant seedlings result at least in part from increased ACS enzymatic activity.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001370.g002. Figure 2. . ACS enzymatic activity is increased in rcn1 mutant seedlings.. Total seedling proteins were extracted from etiolated wild-type and mutant plants five days post-germination. ACS enzymatic activities were assayed in triplicate (see Materials and Methods).. . . . . . PP2A-Mediated Regulation of Ethylene Production Requires Type 1 ACS Isozymes. The eto1 mutation causes ethylene overproduction by stabilizing type 2 ACS isozymes [8], [9], [16], [17]. In both rcn1 and eto1 mutants, ethylene overproduction reduces hypocotyl elongation in dark-grown seedlings, causing a short hypocotyl phenotype. To determine whether PP2A-mediated regulation of ethylene synthesis requires the ETO1 protein, we assayed hypocotyl elongation in rcn1 eto1 double mutant seedlings. As expected, hypocotyl lengths in both single mutants were approximately one-half of those exhibited by the wild-type parents (Figure 3A). Seedlings carrying both the rcn1 and eto1 mutations exhibited an extreme reduction in hypocotyl length, corresponding to 25% of the wild-type parent. Double mutant seedlings also exhibited a significant increase in ethylene production above the level observed in either single mutant parent (p<0.001; Figure 3B). These data indicate that the rcn1 and eto1 defects in regulation of ethylene synthesis are additive, suggesting independent modes of action for PP2A and ETO1. Although the ethylene overproduction defect of eto1 seedlings is more severe than that of rcn1 seedlings, the hypocotyl lengths of the two mutants are similar in our assays (Figure 3B versus 3A). However, both the site (or source tissue) and timing of ethylene overproduction will affect the overall length of hypocotyls, and the rcn1 and eto1 mutants may differ significantly in these characteristics.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001370.g003. Figure 3. . PP2A-dependent ethylene overproduction is ETO1-independent and requires type 1 isozymes.. (A) The hypocotyl elongation defects of the rcn1-1 and eto1-1 single mutants are additive in the rcn1 eto1 double mutant. Hypocotyl lengths of wild-type and mutant seedlings were measured after 5 days growth in the dark. Values shown represent average lengths; error bars show standard deviation (n>25). Shading differences indicate statistically significant differences in hypocotyl length (p<0.001). (B) The ethylene overproduction defects of the rcn1-1 and eto1-1 single mutants are additive in the rcn1 eto1 double mutant. Wild-type and mutant seedlings were grown in sealed vials and ethylene levels were measured after 5 days growth in the dark. Values shown represent the average ethylene volume released per seedling. Error bars represent standard deviation (n4). (C) The cantharidin responsiveness of hypocotyl growth is reduced in plants carrying acs2 and acs6 mutations. Wild-type and mutant seedlings were grown in the presence or absence of 3 M cantharidin, and hypocotyl lengths were measured after 5 days growth in the dark. Values shown represent average hypocotyl lengths of CT-grown plants as a percentage of the control length for that genotype; error bars show standard error (see Materials and Methods). Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference in cantharidin response (p<0.05). (D) Cantharidin-induced ethylene synthesis is reduced in acs2 and acs2 acs6 mutants. Wild-type and mutant seedlings were grown in sealed vials in the presence or absence of 3 M cantharidin and ethylene levels were measured as described above; the percent increase induced by cantharidin treatment is shown for each genotype. Error bars represent standard deviation (n=3).. . . . To determine whether PP2A-mediated regulation of ethylene synthesis targets particular ACS isozymes, we asked whether acs loss-of-function mutations affect the short hypocotyl phenotype caused by PP2A inhibition. Wild-type seedlings treated with the phosphatase inhibitor cantharidin (CT) exhibit a characteristic inhibition of hypocotyl elongation similar to that observed in untreated rcn1 seedlings [21], [23], [25]. Hypocotyl elongation in the type 1 acs single mutants acs2 and acs6 and in the acs2 acs6 double mutant showed decreased cantharidin response (Figure 3C). These data suggest that the effect of cantharidin on hypocotyl elongation is dependent on type 1 ACS isozymes. Similarly, ACS enzymatic activity in acs2 acs6 double mutant seedlings was insensitive to cantharidin treatment, while normal seedlings treated with cantharidin exhibited increased ACS activity relative to untreated controls (data not shown). Interestingly, acs5 and acs9 loss-of-function mutants showed slightly increased cantharidin response (Figure 3C), indicating that the type 2 isozymes ACS5 and ACS9 are not required for cantharidin-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation.. We also asked whether acs loss-of-function mutations affect ethylene overproduction in the presence of cantharidin. Wild-type seedlings treated with cantharidin exhibited a 76% increase in ethylene production (Figure 3D). While cantharidin-treated acs6 seedlings exhibited a similar increase in ethylene synthesis, both acs2 and acs2 acs6 double mutant seedlings showed a reduced response to cantharidin treatment. Unlike the acs2 and acs6 mutants, acs5 and acs9 mutant seedlings exhibited a reduced baseline level of ethylene production. However, both type 2 acs mutants also showed a greater stimulation of ethylene synthesis in the presence of cantharidin (Figure 3D). Both the decreased basal ethylene synthesis and the increased response to cantharidin were more pronounced in the acs5 acs9 double mutant, which exhibited a three-fold increase in ethylene production when grown in the presence of cantharidin (Figure S1). As in the hypocotyl elongation experiment described above, our data suggest that phosphatase inhibition acts through type 1 ACS isozymes to increase ethylene synthesis, while type 2 isozymes are not required for this effect. In addition, the data suggest that PP2A inhibition may have opposing effects on the activities of type 1 versus type 2 isozymes. This hypothesis is discussed in more detail below.. . . Ethylene Synthesis in rcn1 Plants Is Not Stimulated by Elicitor Treatment. Phosphorylation-mediated stabilization of type 1 ACS isozymes can be induced by treatment with the bacterial elicitor Flg22 [10], [13]. Because both the rcn1 mutation and cantharidin treatment decrease PP2A activity levels, we expect that PP2A substrates will be hyperphosphorylated both in rcn1 plants and in cantharidin-treated wild-type plants. We reasoned that the stabilizing effect of Flg22 treatment might be lessened if steady-state ACS phosphorylation levels are increased in the rcn1 mutant. We measured Flg22-induced ethylene synthesis in wild-type (Col) and rcn1-6 mutant seedlings, and found that rcn1-6 seedlings indeed showed a reduced response to Flg22 treatment (Figure 4). While ethylene production rose by more than 2.5-fold (265%) in wild-type Col seedlings, the elicitor-induced increase in rcn1-6 mutant plants (25%) was not statistically significant. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that the difference between Flg22-treated wild-type (Col) seedlings and rcn1-6 seedlings (Flg22-treated or untreated) also was not statistically significant. Flg22-induced ethylene synthesis in rcn1-6 plants was not rescued by a higher Flg22 dose; treatment with 200 nM Flg22 resulted in a 262% increase in ethylene production in the wild type, and less than a 30% increase in rcn1-6 plants (data not shown). The attenuated effect of Flg22 treatment in rcn1-6 seedlings is consistent with the hypothesis that type 1 ACS isozymes are more phosphorylated and more stable when PP2A activity is reduced.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001370.g004. Figure 4. . Flg22-induced ethylene production is reduced in rcn1 seedlings.. Wild-type and mutant seedlings were grown for 12 days in the light, and ethylene produced during a four-hour Flg22 treatment was measured (see Materials and Methods). Each value represents the average volume of ethylene released per seedling (n=3). Error bars indicate standard deviation. Flg22 treatment induces a significant increase (*) only in wild-type Col seedlings (p<0.05).. . . . . . PP2A Inhibition Stabilizes ACS6 Protein. To directly assess the effect of PP2A inhibition on ACS6 protein turnover, we assayed the stability of an epitope-tagged ACS6 protein [10] in wild-type and rcn1 mutant seedlings, and in wild-type plants grown in the presence of cantharidin. As expected, myc-ACS6 was rapidly turned over in dark-grown seedlings (Figure 5A). The rcn1 mutation retarded the turnover of myc-ACS6, as did cantharidin treatment (Figure 5A). In contrast, the phosphomimic allele myc-ACS6DDD, which exhibits enhanced and phosphorylation-independent stability [13], was equally stable in wild-type seedlings grown in the absence or presence cantharidin (Figure 5B). Thus, the wild-type ACS6 protein is stabilized by phosphatase inhibition, while the phosphomimic ACS6DDD protein is immune to this effect.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001370.g005. Figure 5. . PP2A inhibition stabilizes ACS6 protein.. Wild-type and rcn1-6 seedlings expressing a wild-type myc-ACS6 transgene (A) or a stabilized myc-ACS6DDD transgene (B) were grown in the absence or presence of 3 M cantharidin (CT), and ACS6 turnover was assayed by immunoblotting extracts harvested at time points after addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (see Materials and Methods). Immunoblots were probed with anti-myc to detect myc-ACS6 turnover and anti-PEPC as a loading control. (C) Extracts from wild-type and rcn1-6 seedlings expressing myc-ACS6 were subjected to calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) treatment (+) or incubated in buffer without CIP (-) for ten minutes. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE to resolve the phosphorylated (P-ACS6) and dephosphorylated (ACS6) myc-ACS6 bands (see Materials and Methods). Immunoblots were probed with anti-PEPC (upper panel) as a loading control and with anti-myc (lower panel) to detect myc-ACS6. Migration of myc-ACS6 in treated samples can be compared to myc-ACS6 in untreated extracts (0 min) that were immediately boiled in SDS loading buffer. (D) Extracts from wild-type and rcn1-6 seedlings expressing the wild-type myc-ACS6 were subjected to treatment with PP2A complexes (PP2A) immunoprecipitated from plants expressing RCN1-YFP (+), or incubated in buffer alone (-) for 10 minutes. Samples were processed as described for CIP-treated extracts (panel C above). Immunoblots were probed with anti-myc (upper panel) to detect myc-ACS6 and with anti-RCN1 (lower panel) to detect the RCN1-YFP fusion protein in PP2A-treated samples.. . . . Immunoblots probed with anti-myc antibody revealed two poorly resolved bands near the molecular weight predicted for the myc-ACS6 protein. Extracts from rcn1 mutants and from cantharidin-treated wild-type plants showed enhanced accumulation of the upper band (Figure 5A, 5C and 5D). To determine whether the upper and lower bands corresponded to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated myc-ACS6, we isolated protein extracts from myc-ACS6-expressing wild-type and rcn1 plants and treated aliquots with alkaline phosphatase (Figure 5C) or with PP2A complexes immunoprecipitated from plants expressing an RCN1-YFP fusion protein (Figure 5D). Treatment with either CIP or PP2A resolved the upper and lower bands into a single species running at the position of the lower band (Figure 5C and 5D). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that both the rcn1 lesion and phosphatase inhibition result in the accumulation of a more stable phosphorylated ACS6 species in vivo.. . . ACS6 Protein Interacts with PP2A. We asked whether the ACS6 protein interacts with PP2A complexes in planta. To address this question, we used a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation approach. First we used anti-myc antibodies to immunoprecipitate ACS6 from protein extracts isolated from plants expressing myc-ACS6DDD (Figure 6A). We probed these immunoprecipitates for regulatory A subunits of PP2A using anti-RCN1 antibodies that recognize all three A subunit isoforms [23], [26]. Regulatory A subunits were detected in the pellet fraction even after a detergent wash, suggesting a stable interaction between ACS6DDD and PP2A. When anti-RCN1 antibodies were used for the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting revealed the presence of the myc-ACS6DDD protein in the immunoprecipitates, and the ACS6 signal was maintained through a stringent detergent wash (Figure 6B). A weak but reproducible ACS6 signal was observed in anti-RCN1 immunoprecipitates isolated from plants expressing wild-type myc-ACS6; this signal was reduced after a gentle washing treatment, and was nearly undetectable after a stringent wash (Figure 6C). These co-immunoprecipitation data suggest that PP2A directly interacts with ACS6, and that interaction with the low-abundance wild-type isoform is unstable, while the interaction with the stabilized and more abundant ACS6DDD protein is more robust. While the ACS6DDD protein is an imperfect proxy for the phosphorylated wild-type ACS6 protein in this experiment, PP2A interaction may require motifs outside the MAPK phosphorylation site that are unaffected by the DDD substitution. For instance, in the case of PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of the brassinosteroid-responsive transcription factor BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1), a distinct binding motif is required for the PP2A interaction that leads to dephosphorylation of multiple sites; some or all of these sites lie outside the binding domain [27].. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001370.g006. Figure 6. . PP2A interacts with ACS6 in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations.. Protein extracts from MG132-treated seedlings expressing myc-ACS6DDD (A, B) or wild-type myc-ACS6 (C) were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-myc (A) or anti-RCN1 (B, C) antibodies followed by immunoblotting (IB) with the antibodies indicated. Immunoprecipitates (Pellet fractions) were isolated without a wash (-), or were washed with a detergent-free buffer (*), with buffer containing 0.2% Tween-20 (+), or with buffer containing 0.2% Tween-20 plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (++). Samples of the supernatant fractions (Sup) were also analyzed to test for depletion of the putative interactor. Control immunoprecipitates (without anti-myc or anti-RCN1 antibodies) were washed with detergent-free buffer. Because the signal for wild-type myc-ACS6 was very weak in anti-RCN1 immunoprecipitations (C), extracts from wild-type Col plants lacking a myc-ACS6 transgene were used as a control for background signals.. . . . . . PP2A Dephosphorylates an ACS6 Peptide Substrate In Vitro. . To determine whether PP2A acts directly on ACS6, we asked whether immunoprecipitated PP2A complexes could dephosphorylate an ACS6 phosphosubstrate. Because both native and recombinant ACS6 proteins are very unstable, we used a synthetic C-terminal peptide in our dephosphorylation assays. A C-terminal ACS6 30mer containing the three MPK target motifs was phosphorylated with recombinant MKK4DD and MPK6 [13] and then used as a substrate for immunoprecipitated PP2A complexes isolated from transgenic plants expressing a YFP-tagged RCN1 (Figure 7A). PP2A immunocomplexes showed dephosphorylation activity against the ACS6 C-terminal peptide (Figure 7B). When the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid was added to the dephosphorylation reactions, activity dropped to background levels (data not shown). In combination with our finding that ACS6 and PP2A interact physically (Figure 6), these data suggest that ACS6 is a bona fide PP2A substrate in etiolated seedlings.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001370.g007. Figure 7. . RCN1-containing PP2A complexes dephosphorylate the ACS6 C-terminal phosphopeptide.. PP2A immunocomplexes were isolated and assayed for peptide dephosphorylating activity (A, B). Total protein extracts were prepared from three independent samples of dark-grown seedlings expressing an RCN1-YFP fusion protein [21]. Each extract was divided and immunocomplexes were isolated using anti-GFP antibodies (+Ab) or Protein A agarose beads alone (-Ab). Fractions of the total extracts (Total) and the immunoprecipitated pellets (-Ab and +Ab) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (A) using anti-RCN1 (upper panel) and anti-C subunit (lower panel) antisera. Anti-RCN1 antibodies detect both the RCN1-YFP fusion protein and the PP2AA2 and PP2AA3 (A2+A3) proteins. (B) The (+) Ab and (-) Ab immunocomplexes were assayed for phosphatase activity against a 33P-labeled ACS6 phosphopeptide (see Materials and Methods). Values shown represent the average dephosphorylating activities present in the immunocomplexes. Error bars show standard error. Average dephosphorylation activities of (+) Ab and (-) Ab pellets are significantly different (p<0.05). (C) Crude extracts from wild-type and from rcn1-6 and pp2aa2-1 pp2aa3-1 mutant seedlings were assayed for 33P-labeled ACS6 phosphopeptide phosphatase activity in the presence or absence of 1 nM okadaic acid (OKA), which specifically inhibits PP2A (see Materials and Methods). Values shown represent the average peptide dephosphorylation activities. Error bars show standard deviation.. . . . To determine whether a specific population of PP2A complexes may dephosphorylate ACS6, we tested the activities of crude lysates extracted from plants carrying mutations in genes encoding the three scaffolding A subunits of PP2A. Plants carrying the rcn1 mutation maintain expression of the PP2AA2 and PP2AA3 scaffolds, while plants carrying the pp2aa2-1 pp2aa3-1 double mutant combination express only the RCN1 scaffold [26]. Okadaic acid-sensitive ACS6 dephosphorylating activity was observed in extracts from wild-type and pp2aa2-1 pp2aa3-1 seedlings, but not in extracts from rcn1 plants (Figure 7C). In replicate experiments, extracts from pp2aa2-1 pp2aa3-1 mutants showed 787% of wild-type activity levels, while rcn1 mutants showed only background (01%) levels of activity (n=4). These data indicate that RCN1-containing PP2A complexes are required for dephosphorylation of the ACS6 C-terminus. In contrast to the results obtained with this ACS6 peptide substrate, rcn1 mutant plants exhibit approximately a two-fold decrease in bulk PP2A activity (measured against the model substrate myelin basic protein; [22], [23]), while pp2aa2-1 pp2aa3-1 plants exhibit 895% of wild-type bulk activity (J. Blakeslee, J. Heath and A. DeLong, unpublished). Thus our data indicate a specific requirement for the RCN1 scaffold in ACS6 dephosphorylation. These data are consistent with the specificity we observe in regulation of hypocotyl elongation; in contrast to the characteristic short hypocotyl phenotype of rcn1 mutant plants (58.64.1% of wild-type), pp2aa2-1 pp2aaa3-1 seedlings exhibit nearly normal hypocotyl lengths (96.73.6% of wild-type).. . . PP2A Inhibition Reduces ACS5 Protein Accumulation. We observed a strikingly different effect of PP2A inhibition on ACS5 protein levels. As expected, normal seedlings exhibited rapid turnover of a myc-tagged ACS5 protein (Figure 8A). In rcn1 seedlings, myc-ACS5 accumulation was dramatically reduced (Figure 8A). Direct comparisons of myc-ACS5 abundance in serial extract dilutions indicate that myc-ACS5 accumulation is reduced at least 25-fold in rcn1 seedlings (see Figure S2B). We observed a similar decrease in myc-ACS5 accumulation when wild-type myc-ACS5 plants were treated with cantharidin (see Figure S2D). Although the reduced baseline accumulation of ACS5 in this experiment precludes accurate measurements of turnover under conditions of phosphatase inhibition, ACS5 protein does not appear to be stabilized by the rcn1 mutation or by cantharidin treatment, but rather appears to be de-stabilized. These experiments employed an inducible myc-ACS5 construct [8] and reduced myc-ACS5 accumulation was apparent across a wide range of induction levels (25 to 200 nM Dexamethasone; see Figure S2A). At higher levels of induction, accumulation of the myc-ACS5 protein was more easily detected in rcn1 mutant seedlings. Although turnover in wild-type seedlings was impeded at this expression level, myc-ACS5 was clearly unstable in the rcn1 mutant plants (Figure S2C). Strikingly, accumulation and turnover of the stabilized myc-ACS5eto2 protein product was not affected by the rcn1 mutation (Figure 8B). This result argues that the decreased accumulation of wild-type myc-ACS5 results from ACS5 protein instability, rather than any effect on the Dex-inducibility of transgene expression in rcn1 plants. It also demonstrates that PP2A-dependent regulation of ACS5 accumulation requires the C-terminal sequences that are recognized by ETO1.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001370.g008. Figure 8. . PP2A inhibition decreases ACS5 accumulation.. Wild-type and rcn1-6 mutant seedlings carrying Dexamethasone-inducible wild-type myc-ACS5 (A) or myc-ACS5eto2 (B) transgenes were grown on media containing 25 nM Dexamethasone and extracts were harvested at time points after addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Immunoblots were probed with anti-myc to detect myc-ACS5 proteins and with anti-PEPC as a loading control.. . . . These observations are consistent with the increased cantharidin responsiveness of ethylene production and hypocotyl elongation we observed in acs5 and acs9 mutant plants (Figure 3C and 3D); in type 2 acs mutants, baseline ACS activity levels are reduced and the relative effect of stabilizing type 1 isozymes is exaggerated. Our data suggest that loss of PP2A activity simultaneously increases accumulation and activity of type 1 isozymes while reducing accumulation and activity of type 2 isozymes. Because normal baseline ACS activity levels are very low in dark-grown seedlings, stabilization of a single isozyme type has an obvious effect on ethylene production, even when other isozymes are destabilized. In effect, the increase in ethylene production due to stabilization of type 1 isozymes masks the destabilization of type 2 enzymes in hypocotyl elongation and ethylene biosynthesis experiments, and in the eto1 epistasis experiment..
PMC5064020	Results. . NLP8 is required for nitrate-promoted seed germination. Columbia (Col-0) wild-type seeds of Arabidopsis are dormant when harvested from plants grown at 16C (refs 23, 24). The dormant Col-0 seeds did not germinate when imbibed in water, but germinated in the presence of 1mM KNO3. We utilized this system to investigate the nitrate response in seed germination. We previously reported that nitrate-induced gene expression occurs in 6-h imbibed seeds25. Therefore, we hypothesized that seeds imbibed for a short period of time (within 6h), contain all components necessary for nitrate signalling. On the basis of the microarray data from seeds imbibed for <6h (ref. 26), we selected candidate regulators for nitrate signalling in seeds and analysed whether or not corresponding T-DNA insertion mutants displayed nitrate-induced seed germination. Among the mutant lines examined, mutants defective in NIN-like protein8 (NLP8; At2g43500) did not germinate in the presence of 1mM KNO3.. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes nine NLP family members27. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that NLP8 was highly induced in imbibed seeds and the most abundantly expressed NLPs in 6-h imbibed seeds (Fig. 1a). Expression analysis also showed that nitrate does not regulate the mRNA level of NLP8 during seed germination (Supplementary Fig. 1). The nlp8 (nlp8-1 to nlp8-4) and nlp9 (nlp9-1 and nlp9-2) seeds of Col-0 background grown at 16C were used for germination tests (Fig. 1b). Col-0 and nlp9 mutants showed nitrate-promoted germination, however four nlp8 alleles did not (Fig. 1c). The nlp8-2nlp9-1 double mutant showed no germination in the presence of KNO3 (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that NLP8 is required for nitrate-promoted seed germination.. We then investigated whether the role of NLP8 was conserved across accessions. Wassilewskija-4 (Ws-4) and Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) accessions produce dormant seeds even harvested from plants grown at 22C. Seeds of Ws-4 wild-type and nlp8-5 mutant in the Ws-4 background harvested from plants grown at 22C were tested to determine whether germination could be promoted by nitrate (Fig. 1b). Ws-4 seeds, but not nlp8-5 seeds, responded to nitrate (Fig. 1d). We then tested the effect of the nlp8 mutation in the Cvi background. nlp8-2 was crossed to Cvi and near-isogenic lines were isolated after four backcross generations for the nlp8-2 mutation in the Cvi background (nlp8-2/Cvi) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Germination tests were performed using nlp8-2/Cvi and Cvi seeds. We found that the nlp8-2 mutation reduced the seed nitrate response in the Cvi background (Fig. 1d), showing that the requirement for NLP8 in nitrate-promoted germination is conserved across Arabidopsis accessions.. . . NLP8 is involved in nitrate signalling during germination. To examine the specificity of the nlp8 mutant phenotype to nitrate, the effect of stratification was tested. Stratified nlp8-1, nlp8-2 and nlp8-2nlp9-1 were able to germinate without application of KNO3, which was similar to that of the wild type (Supplementary Fig. 3). This indicates that nlp8 mutants are able to respond to the stratification treatment.. NR mutants are defective in both nitrate assimilation and nitric oxide (NO) production2829. To distinguish if the effect of NLP8 on nitrate-regulated germination is triggered by direct nitrate signalling or nitrate assimilation and its products, nlp8-2nia1nia2 and nlp9-1nia1nia2 triple mutants were made. Germination of the nia1nia2 and nlp9-1nia1nia2 mutants was promoted upon application of nitrate (Fig. 2a). However, the nlp8-2nia1nia2 triple mutant did not respond to nitrate (Fig. 2a). This indicates that the role of NLP8 in nitrate-promoted germination involves nitrate signalling, rather than nitrate assimilation or NO production. NO-induced seed germination was shown to be mediated by the N-end rule proteasome degradation pathway, and two enzymes, Proteolysis 6 (PRT6) and Arg-tRNA protein transferase (ATE), were recently shown to be required for NO-promoted seed germination15. The prt6 and ate1ate2 mutants were still sensitive to nitrate-promoted seed germination (Fig. 2a), suggesting that the nitrate and NO signalling pathways are distinct from one another in seed germination.. CHL1 was characterized as a nitrate sensor in Arabidopsis, and phosphorylation at T101 is important for nitrate transport and response16. The chl1 mutant was shown to be less sensitive to nitrate during seed germination10. Therefore, we compared the nitrate responsiveness between nlp8 and chl1 mutants during germination. The chl1-5 mutant contains a deletion that eliminates CHL1, while T101A/chl1-5 and T101D/chl1-5 lines contain the CHL1 mutant genes with T101A and T101D, respectively, in the chl1-5 mutant background16. chl1-5, T101A/chl1-5 and T101D/chl1-5 were tested for their nitrate response in seed germination. Similar to the previous report10, chl1-5 is less sensitive to nitrate-promoted seed germination compared with the Col-0 control (Fig. 2b). However, the insensitivity of chl1-5 to nitrate was only observed at low concentrations of nitrate, while nlp8-2 displayed a more prominent insensitivity to nitrate (Fig. 2b). This indicates that NLP8 regulates a wider range of nitrate responses than CHL1 does during seed germination. The negligible difference in germination phenotypes between chl1-5 and T101A/chl1-5 or T101D/chl1-5 suggested that the phosphorylation status of T101 of CHL1 has little effect on nitrate-promoted seed germination (Fig. 2b).. . . NLP8 regulates gene expression in response to nitrate. An RNA-seq experiment was performed using RNA extracted from Col-0 and nlp8-2 seeds imbibed for 6h with 1mM KNO3 or KCl (Supplementary Data 1). Forty seven upregulated genes and twenty-nine downregulated genes were identified in 6-h imbibed Col-0 seeds (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4). Gene ontology (GO) term distribution indicates genes encoding transcription factors (eight genes, P=0.038) and related to nitrogen metabolism (six genes, P=6.47e-6) are overrepresented among those genes upregulated by nitrate. Some of the known nitrate-inducible genes such as NIA1, NIA2, nitrite reductase1 (NIR1), root-type Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase1 (RFNR1), RFNR2, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase2 (G6PD2) and G2-like transcription factor (AT1G25550) were included in the upregulated genes. In addition as we previously reported, CYP707A2, the main ABA catabolic gene during seed germination, was induced by nitrate. No other genes related to ABA and GA metabolism and signalling were found among the list of nitrate-regulated genes (Supplementary Fig. 5). Nitrate-mediated upregulation of almost all of the nitrate-inducible genes identified by RNA-seq, was absent or was significantly decreased in the nlp8-2 mutant (Fig. 3a). This was also true for the nitrate downregulated genes. Expression of some genes was further analysed by qRT-PCR to examine their expression kinetics on imbibition in the seed. When Col-0 seeds were imbibed in water with KCl, the expression of CYP707A2 increased and then decreased, with its maximum expression at 6h (Fig. 3b). The expression of CYP707A2 in imbibed Col-0 seeds was induced by KNO3 with similar kinetics but at a higher level to that observed for the KCl-treated seeds. CYP707A2 had a much lower level of expression of in nlp8-2 in both KCl and KNO3 imbibed seeds. Importantly, nitrate had no effect on the expression of CYP707A2 in nlp8-2 (Fig. 3b). This was also found to be true for the expression of NIA2 (Fig. 3c). In addition, the expression of another eight genes were analysed by qRT-PCR and we observed expression patterns consistent with the RNA-seq data (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).. . . NLP8 regulates ABA catabolism and induces CYP707A2. To determine whether the nitrate-induced decline in ABA contents is NLP8-dependent, the ABA content was measured in dry seeds and imbibed seeds of Col-0 and nlp8-2 with 1mM KCl or KNO3 (Fig. 4a). In Col-0 seeds, the nitrate-induced ABA decrease was observed at 9h after the onset of imbibition, and the ABA content in KNO3-treated seeds was lower than those in KCl-treated seeds thereafter (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, the ABA content in KNO3-treated nlp8-2 seeds was comparable to that seen in the KCl-treated nlp8-2 seeds, which was equivalent to that in KCl-treated Col-0 seeds (Fig. 4a). This indicates that the ABA decrease by nitrate is NLP8-dependent. The aba2 mutant line, which has a defect in ABA biosynthesis, was non-dormant even when harvested from 16C, and was able to germinate in the absence of nitrate (Fig. 4b). aba2 was found to be epistatic to nlp8-2 since aba2nlp8-2 germinated even without nitrate, showing that de novo ABA biosynthesis is required for nlp8-2 to establish seed dormancy. Col-0 and cyp707a1 responded to nitrate, while cyp707a2 was less sensitive to nitrate (Fig. 4b). Nitrate-promoted germination was not observed in the cyp707a1nlp8-2 and cyp707a2nlp8-2 double mutants (Fig. 4b). It is noteworthy that nitrate-independent expression of CYP707A2 in nlp8-2 by introducing the 35S::CYP707A2 caused nitrate-independent germination (Fig. 4b). Taken together, these results suggest that NLP8-mediated induction of CYP707A2 promotes seed germination in response to nitrate.. To test whether CYP707A2 is a direct target of NLP8, a 1.9-kb 5 non-coding region of CYP707A2 was cloned, fused to a GUS reporter gene (A2-GUS), and transformed into Col-0 (Fig. 5a). The A2-GUS seeds from 16C grown plants were tested for nitrate-induced reporter expression by qRT-PCR. The expression of the native CYP707A2 served as a positive control for measuring nitrate-induction of the reporter gene expression. A2-GUS lines (#1 and #6) displayed nitrate-induced reporter expression similar to the native CYP707A2 (Fig. 5b). Next, a promoter deletion series were made and fused to the GUS reporter gene to identify the promoter region responsible for nitrate induction (Fig. 5a). These promoter deletion constructs, d1-GUS to d3-GUS, were transformed into Col-0 and selected transgenic lines were grown at 16C. The d1-GUS (-1,661) line showed nitrate-induced reporter expression that was similar to the A2-GUS lines. In contrast, the d2-GUS (-1,373) and d3-GUS (-741) lines did not show nitrate-induced reporter expression (Fig. 5b). This indicates that the region between -1,661 and -1,373 is responsible for the nitrate-mediated induction of CYP707A2.. We next generated 35S::NLP8-GFP transgenic lines. Six DNA fragments spanning CYP707A2 as shown in Fig. 5a, were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The co-immunoprecipitated DNA was analysed by quantitative PCR. Relative fold enrichment was calculated by normalizing the value of immunoprecipitated anti-GFP fragments to that of the control sample that did not contain any antibody. Fragments #1 (-1,661 to -1,552) and #2 (-1,549 to -1,383) showed enrichment, but not fragments #3 to #6, in nitrate-treated samples (Fig. 5c), demonstrating a direct binding of NLP8 to these fragments in the promoter region of CYP707A2. Such enrichments were not observed in the KCl-treated samples (Fig. 5c). These results collectively suggest that NLP8 directly binds to the promoter of CYP707A2 in a nitrate-dependent manner and upregulates its expression during seed germination in the presence of nitrate.. A protoplast assay was employed to further narrow down the promoter region responsible for NLP8-dependent expression of CYP707A2. A series of promoter deletions fused to a LUC reporter gene were tested for their nitrate induction when co-transformed with the 35S::NLP8-GFP construct. Two positive controls, A2-LUC and d1-LUC(-1,661), showed the NLP8-dependent nitrate response in the protoplast assay similar to that observed in the A2-GUS and d1-GUS stable transgenic lines (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 8). Nitrate-induced reporter expression was also observed in d1.2-LUC(-1,638), d1.3-LUC(-1,615) and d1.4-LUC(-1,589) but not in d1.5-LUC(-1,549) (Supplementary Fig. 8), indicating that the 41bp region between d1.4 and d1.5 is responsible for NLP8-dependent nitrate induction (Fig. 5d).. To identify the NLP8-binding sites, mutations were introduced to d1.4-LUC and the NLP8-dependent reporter expression was analysed in the presence of nitrate in the protoplast assay (Fig. 5d,e). d1.4-LUC with disruptions of single sites (1m, 2m, 3m) and double sites (1m2m, 1m3m) still responded to NLP8, but the d1.4-LUC with all three sites mutated (1m2m3m) did not respond (Fig. 5e). This result suggests that these three sites are required for NLP8-dependent gene expression.. We next performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to verify the physical interaction between NLP8 and the promoter of CYP707A2. The binding of the RWP-RK domain of NLP8 to the d1-d1.5 fragment resulted a shifted band in the EMSA (Supplementary Fig. 9a). The application of nitrate did not affect its binding (Supplementary Fig. 9a). The shifted band disappeared by addition of competitor d1.4-d1.5 (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 9a), but mutant competitor with all three sites disrupted failed to compete (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 9b). These collectively indicate that NLP8 binds to these three sites in the CYP707A2 promoter.. . . Nitrate activates NLP8 and NLP7 via distinct mechanisms. A 35S::NLP8-GFP construct was introduced into nlp8-2 by crossing them together, and the homozygous lines for both 35S::NLP8-GFP and the nlp8-2 mutation were selected for and designated as NLP8-GFP nlp8-2. NLP8-GFP nlp8-2 was able to germinate in the presence of nitrate (Fig. 6a), showing that NLP8-GFP complemented nlp8-2. It was also found that the constitutive expression of NLP8-GFP did not confer nitrate-independent germination, but that germination of NLP8-GFP nlp8-2 still required nitrate. NLP8-GFP also failed to alleviate the weak reduced nitrate sensitivity phenotype of chl1-5 (Supplementary Fig. 10). Interestingly, the double homozygous line for 35S::NLP7-GFP and the nlp8-2 mutation, NLP7-GFP nlp8-2, failed to complement the nlp8-2 mutation (Fig. 6a). This suggests that NLP7 and NLP8 have distinct functions from one another. To test whether the subcellular localization of NLP8 is under the control of nitrate like it is the case for NLP7, germinated seedlings of 35S::NLP8-GFP and 35S::NLP7-GFP were observed using confocal microscopy to examine subcellular localization of GFP signals with or without nitrate. The GFP signal of the NLP7-GFP was localized to the cytoplasm in the absence of nitrate, and with the application of nitrate became nuclear localized within a few minutes (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Movie 1), as reported in (ref. 22). In contrast, NLP8-GFP was localized in the nuclei regardless of nitrate application (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Movie 2). This suggests that nitrate may activate NLP8 by a different mechanism from that of NLP7.. The N-terminal region of NLP6 was shown to function as a nitrate-dependent transcriptional activation domain20. The N-terminal region (1-576 amino acids) of NLP8 was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (LexA_DB) to make the NLP8N-LexA_DB-YFP effector. The NLP8N-LexA_DB-YFP chimeric transcription factor construct was transformed together with the reporter, LexAOP-35Smini::GUS, into Col-0 plants (Fig. 6c). Similar to NLP8-GFP, NLP8N-LexA_DB-YFP also localized to the nuclei with or without nitrate application (Fig. 6b). Transgenic plants containing both chimeric constructs were examined for reporter expression. Seven-day-old nitrate-starved seedlings and imbibed seeds displayed nitrate-dependent GUS reporter expression (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 11). It is worth noting that, before application of nitrate, NLP8-YFP is localized in nuclei in the guard cells of cotyledons (Fig. 6b), and this cell type is competent (or contains components necessary) to trigger NLP8-dependent nitrate inducible gene expression (Fig. 6d). Taken together, these data indicate that the N-terminal region is responsible for induction of NLP8 by nitrate and NLP8-dependent nitrate signalling is unlikely to involve nitrate-dependent change in protein localization..
PMC2803491	Results. By mutagenizing with different EMS concentrations we have developed a permanent collection of 3712 M2/M3 independent mutant lines in the reference strain Landsberg erecta (Ler) of A. thaliana. This population has been named as the Arabidopsis TILLer collection. The frequency of mutations per line was maximized by using M1 plants with low but sufficient seed fertility. Application of TILLING to search for mutants in 14 genes identified 21 to 46 mutations per gene, which correspond to a total of 450 mutations. Missense mutations were found for all genes while truncations were selected for all except one. We estimated that, on average, these lines carry one mutation every 89 kb, Ler population providing a total of more than five million induced mutations. It is estimated that TILLer collection shows a two to three fold higher EMS mutation density per individual than previously reported A. thaliana population..
PMC3177193	RESULTSOverall structure of Arabidopsis SE coreArabidopsis SE core adopts a walking man-like topology with N-terminal two alpha-helices resembling the leading leg, the Middle alpha-helix dominant domain resembling the body and the C-terminal non-canonical C2H2 zinc-finger domain featuring Helix-kink-Helix (HkH) motif resembling the lagging leg (Figure 1).The green-colored N-terminal domain (residues 195-240) consists of a short alpha-helix (alpha1) followed by an orthogonally oriented long alpha-helix (alpha2) that shares the fold of N-terminal half of histone H3 core (Z-score 4.4, r.m.s.d. 2.0 , 43Calpha) (Supplementary Figure S1A) (14). The N-terminal domain is connected to the Middle domain through a short alpha-helix (alpha3). The cyan-colored Middle domain (residues 241-469) displays a novel fold dissimilar to any solved structure hitherto, according to Dali (www2.embl-ebi.ac.uk/dali). The Middle domain consists of loosely packed three alpha-helices (alpha5-alpha7) oriented orthogonally against a central 30 bending long alpha-helix (alpha4). A pair of anti-parallel short beta-strands (beta1, beta2) is embedded within a partially disordered long loop connecting alpha5 to alpha6, whereas alpha6 is connected to alpha7 by another partially disordered long loop. The Middle domain is followed by the C-terminal C2H2 zinc-finger domain via a short alpha-helix (alpha8). The presence of three disordered loops (residues 290-324, 366-380 and 435-444) in Middle domain implicates its role in protein-protein interaction with SE partners and/or substrates.The magenta-colored C-terminal non-canonical C2H2 zinc-finger domain (residues 471-543) adopts a variant C2H2 zinc-finger fold with beta-beta-beta-alpha architecture (beta3-beta5 and alpha10) flanked by one additional alpha-helix (alpha9) at its N-terminus and one additional atypical kinked long alpha-helix at its C-terminus (alpha11) (Figure 2B, left panel). The central beta-beta-beta-alpha architecture has the similar structural fold of transcriptional factor Swi5 (Z-score 3.9, r.m.s.d. 2.9 , 46Calpha) (Supplementary Figure S1B) (15) and zinc-finger domain of human zinc-finger BED domain containing protein 2 (Z-score, 3.6, r.m.s.d. 4.2 , 60Calpha) (Figure 2B, middle panel) (PDB accession: 2DJR). Notably, the structural motif of the zinc-finger domain, including the canonical beta-beta-alpha structure and the C-terminal long alpha helix-kink-helix (HkH) motif, resembles that of IPTase (Figure 2B, right panel) (16). The beta-beta-alpha-alpha(HkH) motif identified in IPTase putatively represents zinc-finger proteins that specifically bind to dsRNA (16).Role of SE core in SE-HYL1 and SE-DCL1 interactionsHYL1 and SE are known to bind DCL1 to promote preciseness of pre-miRNA processing (6). However, the domain contacts within the hetero-trimer are yet to be detailed. With the SE core structure in hand, we attempted on mapping of domain interactions between SE, HYL1 and DCL1 by in vitro pull-down assay. DCL1 RNaseIIIa+IIIb domains could not be tested in this assay due to low solubility of this fragment expressed in bacterium. GST-fused DCL1 helicase and PAZ domains showed weak interactions with hexahistidine-tagged SE core, detected by polyclonal anti-SE core antibody raised in rabbit (Figure 3A and B). In addition, both GST-fused HYL1 RBD1+2 and GST-fused HYL1 RBD2 were able to pull-down SE core, whereas GST-fused HYL1 RBD1 failed to pull-down SE core (Figure 3A and B). The observation agrees with the notion proposed by Yang et al. (2010) (17) that HYL1 RBD2, not RBD1, is solely responsible for protein-protein interaction. Next, we asked whether a certain domain within SE core specifically participates in or eludes SE-HYL1 interaction. As expected, both GST-fused SE N-terminal (SE-NT) and SE Middle (SE-Mid) domains were able to pull-down HYL1 RBD2 but not HYL1 RBD1 (Figure 3C). SE C-terminal zinc-finger domain alone could not be expressed in bacterium and so was excluded from this assay.. Figure 3.Protein network amongst SE, HYL1 and DCL1. (A) Domain architectures of DCL1 (upper panel) and HYL1 (bottom panel). (B) In vitro pull-down assay showing Arabidopsis SE core binds to Arabidopsis DCL1 helicase and PAZ domains as well as Arabidopsis HYL1 RBD2 domain directly. (C) In vitro pull-down assay showing Arabidopsis SE core binds to HYL1 RBD2 via its N-terminal and middle domains.SE ZF+C is critical to rescue se-1 phenotypeThe protein-protein interactions described above were tested within SE core covering only 50% of full-length SE sequence. The N- and C-terminal tails outside SE core were predicted to be unstructured and turned out to be non-crystallizable. Nevertheless, these putatively unstructured tails may have important functional impacts for miRNA processing. To investigate this possibility, we generated transgenic lines expressing HA- and myc-tagged full-length SE and SE core under 35S promoter in the se-1 background, respectively. Notably, full-length SE, instead of SE core can considerably rescue the morphological phenotype of se-1 mutant (Figure 4A and B). Typical phenotypes of se-1 mutant, such as leaf serration and abnormal cluster of flowers and siliques (Figure 4A indicated by arrows colored in red), went unobserved by expression of full-length SE protein. By contrast, transgenic Arabidopsis expressing myc-tagged SE core in the se-1 background showed pleiotropic phenotypes characteristic of se-1 mutant line.. Figure 4.SE C-terminal region is essential to rescue se-1 mutant phenotype. (A and B) Comparison of the morphological phenotype between Col-0, se-1, se-1/35S::myc-se, se-1/35S::myc-se core, se-1/35S::myc-se core+C plants.Surprisingly, the expression of longer fragment including SE core and C-terminal tail (SE core+C) was sufficient to rescue the miRNA morphology phenotype (Figure 4A and B). Along with the recovery of WT morphology, miRNA levels of se-1 mutant, exampled by miR164 and miR319, as well as their mRNA targets were also restored close to WT expression levels (Figure 5B and C). By contrast, neither SE core nor SE core+N was able to restore the miRNA deficiency morphology (Figure 5B and C). These molecular and morphological observations indicate that SE core+C can largely restore SE deficiency in the se-1 mutant background and its activity is comparable to that of SE.. Figure 5.Both SE zinc-finger domain and C-terminal region is required to rescue se-1 mutant phenotype. (A) Comparison of the morphological phenotype between Col-0, se-1, se-1/35S::myc-se, se-1/35S::myc-se core, se-1/35S::myc-se core+C, se-1/35S::myc-se core+N, se-1/myc-se Zf+C, se-1/myc-se Zf+C (C500S/C505S) plants. (B and C) Accumulation of small RNAs and target mRNAs (C) in Col-0, se-1, se-1/35S::myc-se, se-1/35S::myc-se core, se-1/35S::myc-se core+C, se-1/35S::myc-se core+N and se-1/35S::myc-se ZF+C plants. Each lane contained 12g RNA. rRNAs were used as a loading control.To narrow down the minimum requirement of SE domains capable of phenotype rescue, we made a truncated fragment consisting only of the zinc-finger domain and the C-terminal tail (SE ZF+C). Remarkably, the expression of SE ZF+C in the se-1 mutant background was able to rescue serration phenotype. The expression of miRNAs was rescued and the expression of their target mRNAs was decreased likewise (Figure 5B and C). Consistent to the notion of the importance of C-terminal ZF domain, the introduction of point mutations at the two cysteine residues involved in Zinc coordination (C500S/C505S double mutant) disrupted the rescue ability and caused reversion of serration phenotype and extremely retarded growth (Figure 5A).SE core+C binds pre-miRNA in vitroThe phenotype rescue experiment indicates that SE core together with some undetermined residues located somewhere in C-terminal tail retain in vivo function. Next, we asked whether the functional role in miRNA processing displayed by SE in vivo is due to the RNA binding ability of SE core+C. To this end, we tested substrate-binding ability of SE core+C by EMSA in vitro, and found that SE core+C can stably associate with biotin-labelled pre-miR164c (Figure 6A). To further narrow down the necessary residues within C-terminal tail that enables SE zinc-finger domain to bind miRNA precursors, we made a series of SE constructs gradually lengthening the tail from SE core toward C-terminus and tested substrate binding by EMSA in vitro. We found out that the fragment comprising SE core plus 36 residues (194-579) is enough to stably associate with internally digoxygenin-labelled pre-miR164c (Figure 6B). These results show that SE is an RNA binding protein and that substrate recognition by SE probably plays a role in phenotype rescue.. Figure 6.SE core+C binds pre-miR164c in vitro. (A) EMSA results showing that SE core+C (residues 194-720) binds biotin-labelled pre-miR164c.

PMC4809279	ResultsNatural variation in rosette-related phenotypes under salt stressTo determine natural variation in shoot growth under salt stress conditions, Arabidopsis accessions were screened for their rosette size in control and saline conditions. Two large-scale experiments, each consisting of 160 Arabidopsis accessions selected from the HapMap population, were conducted in greenhouse conditions using rainwater containing 0, 300 or 500mM NaCl starting from 20 days after germination (Supplementary Fig. S1). The treatment was repeated every second day for 15 days, after which projected rosette area (PRA), fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) were determined. In the experiment using 500mM NaCl, fresh and dry weight of rosette and flowering stem were measured (Supplementary Fig. S1A and Fig. 1A-C). In the experiment using 300mM NaCl as salt stress treatment, the flowering stem was excluded from the measurements. Additionally, in this experiment the relative electrolyte leakage (EL) was determined for 113 accessions (Supplementary Fig. S1B and Fig. 1D). The selection of accessions used for the individual experiments is listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. The populations of Arabidopsis accessions differed between the two experiments, with 81 overlapping accessions. The projected rosette area was highly correlated between the experiments for plants grown in control and salt stress conditions, while the biomass could not be compared since different tissues were harvested for the individual experiments (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). High correlations in projected rosette area between the experiments indicate high reproducibility of the phenotypes measured.Fig. 1.Natural variation in salinity tolerance observed for Arabidopsis accessions. The phenotypes of plants grown in control and salt stress conditions were studied in order to examine the natural variation within the population studied. The average value per accession was calculated. (A) fresh weight (FW) and (B) dry weight (DW) of the entire above-ground part were determined in the experiment conducted in the year 2012 (dark box plots), while fresh weight of the rosette was measured in the experiment conducted in the year 2013 (light box plots). (C) Projected rosette area (PRA) was significantly smaller for the plants watered with 300 and 500mM NaCl when compared with plants grown in control conditions. (D) Electrolyte leakage (EL) increased for plants watered with 300mM NaCl compared with plants grown in control condition. (E) Water content calculated as (FW-DW)/DW was significantly decreased in both salt stress treatments relative to control conditions. The boxplots represent the median length as observed in 160 accessions for FW, DW, PRA and WC and in 113 accessions for EL. The whiskers extend to data points that are less than 1.5 the interquartile range (IQR) away from the first and third quartile. Notches represent 1.58IQR/n and give 95% confidence that two medians differ. Accessions representing outliers for a trait are indicated.While high biomass and rosette projected area would indicate salinity tolerance, increased electrolyte leakage corresponds to cell damage and can be used for indicating salt stress sensitive accessions. Considerable natural variation was observed for all phenotypes studied (Fig. 1). Both salt stress treatments significantly decreased the rosette area and weight when compared with control conditions (Fig. 1A-C). The relative electrolyte leakage increased approximately 10-fold in leaf discs excised from salt-treated plants (Fig. 1D). Moreover, plants grown under saline conditions showed reduced variability in the rosette size. This reduction in phenotype distribution was more severe for plants growing at 500mM NaCl than at 300mM NaCl (Fig. 1A-C). On the other hand, variation in the relative electrolyte leakage increased after salt stress treatment (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the accessions identified as outliers differed among different traits and conditions studied (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3). In order to establish intrinsic correlations between quantified rosette traits, Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were calculated (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Fresh and dry weights were observed to be in strong correlation in all conditions studied (r>0.72), while the correlation between the rosette area and weight was weaker yet significant (r>0.65). Water content showed strong (r=0.71) correlation with fresh weight only in plants treated with 500mM NaCl, while for plants grown in control conditions the correlation was either negative (both experiments) or non-significant (300mM NaCl). Electrolyte leakage was in negative correlation with rosette size only under salt stress conditions. Although significant correlations between different phenotypes were observed, varying correlation strength as well as identification of unique outliers suggests the presence of different strategies among Arabidopsis accessions in their response to salt stress.Fig. 2.Natural variation reveals a relationship between development and salt stress tolerance. (A) The correlation between phenotypic traits was determined by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficients (r). The correlation heat map represents the r-values, with orange squares representing negative and blue positive correlations. The significance of r-values is indicated with *, ** or *** for levels of 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. The correlation analysis was performed on 64 accessions included in both experiments and of which EL was measured. The r-values are listed in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4. (B) Clustering of the rosette phenotypes of plants grown in 300mM NaCl was performed using the Ward linkage method. The variation in the phenotypes is represented in different colours normalized with z-Fisher transformation. (C) The fresh weight (FW), projected rosette area (PRA) and relative electrolyte leakage (EL) phenotypes in control and salt stress conditions was observed to differ between identified clusters of accessions. The boxplots represent the median phenotype of all accessions belonging to the specific cluster. The whiskers extend to data points that are less than 1.5 the interquartile range (IQR) away from the first and third quartile. Notches represent 1.58IQR/n and give 95% confidence that two medians differ.Arabidopsis accessions differed in rosette size measured in control conditions. Those developmental differences between individual accessions could explain their respective performance under salt stress conditions. To investigate the relationship between the rosette size in control and salt stress conditions, accession-specific correlations of traits between control and salt stress conditions were examined (Table 1). Rosette weight and area were significantly correlated between control and salt stress treatments in both experiments performed, albeit the correlations were stronger when plants were treated with 300mM NaCl (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Interestingly, the correlation between water content in salt and control condition was significant only when plants were treated with 300mM NaCl. Those observations indicate that the differences in response to lower salt concentrations are linked to developmental phenotypes observed in control conditions. The weaker correlations observed between control plants and plants watered with 500mM NaCl suggest that mechanisms other than development play an important role in maintenance of rosette growth in severe salt stress conditions.Table 1.Overview of phenotypic traits collectedThe effect of salt stress on individual rosette parameters was studied by comparing the value observed in salt stress with control conditions..

The clustering revealed seven distinct groups. Three groups (5, 6 and N13) were represented by one or two accessions. The majority of the accessions belonged to group 1, which showed intermediate rosette weight and area and relatively high electrolyte leakage (Fig. 2C). Accessions with the largest rosette sizes in control and salt stress conditions belonged to group 2 and 3, which both showed relatively low electrolyte leakage under saline stress conditions. Among the accessions belonging to group 3 we identified Tsu-0 and Bur-0, previously established as accessions with enhanced salinity tolerance (Rus et al., 2006; Katori et al., 2010). Accessions in group 4 showed small rosette size in both control and salt stress conditions and high electrolyte leakage in salt stress conditions. The patterns in rosette size and cell damage observed for the majority of accessions reveal a general trend that plants with large rosettes suffer less from salt stress-induced cell damage. Only two accessions belonging to group 6 (Pa-2 and An-1) showed relatively low electrolyte leakage despite small rosette size under salt stress conditions. The diversity of collected phenotypic measurements allowed identification of distinct groups of accessions with general patterns of salt response correlation with rosette size as well as identification of accessions that do not follow the general trend.Identification of putative candidate genes through GWASThe phenotypic data collected from control and saline conditions were used as an input for genome wide association study (GWAS) (Kruijer et al., 2015). The heritability of individual traits (Table 2) varied between 0.156 for projected rosette area at 300mM NaCl and 0.912 for electrolyte leakage in control conditions. Phenotypes with low heritability (<0.2) were excluded from further analysis. Candidate loci were selected based on the minor allele frequency, LOD score and number of significantly associated SNPs within one locus. In total 15 unique associations were identified (Table 3). Fresh weight of plants treated with 500mM NaCl was associated with six genomic regions, and three neighbouring significant SNPs with allele frequency above 0.03 were found on chromosome 3. Dry weight of severely stressed plants was associated with only one SNP on chromosome 4, with low allele frequency (0.01). No significant associations were observed for the fresh weight, dry weight or projected rosette area of plants treated with 300mM NaCl. The ratio of fresh weight per projected rosette area (FWpPRA) in salt (300mM NaCl) conditions, used as a proxy for water retention, was associated with five loci. No overlap in associations was observed, either between salt stress and control conditions or for different phenotypes. The phenotypes collected in control conditions in the experiment performed in the year 2012 did not yield any significant associations, while the associations found for phenotypes scored under control conditions in experiment performed in 2013 are listed in Table 3.Table 2.Trait heritabilityThe heritability for individual rosette phenotypes was calculated on individual values..

This protein is predicted to have 24 LRR domains at its N-terminal extracellular domain (Val44-Leu709) followed by one helical transmembrane domain (Ile710-Ile730) and a cytosol-facing topological domain (Phe731-Ser1045) with a protein kinase domain localized at its C-terminus (Phe775-Ser1045). Natural variation in the promoter and gene coding sequence was examined for the sequenced accessions of the HapMap population and the sequence similarity, gaps and missing data were analysed (Fig. 3B). The promoter sequence upstream of the identified SNP as well as the sequence encoding the C-terminal protein kinase showed little conservation among the sequenced accessions. Since expression of At4g08850 was reported to be enhanced in the root tissue after exposure to salt stress (Fig. 3C, Kilian et al., 2007), we named the gene LRR-Kinase Induced by Salt Stress (LRR-KISS). Natural variation in expression of LRR-KISS was observed previously (Lempe et al., 2005), with Cen-0 showing enhanced, and HR-5 exhibiting reduced expression levels (Fig. 3D). These accessions showing contrasting levels of LRR-KISS expression were tested for salinity tolerance under mild salt stress conditions. One-week-old seedlings were watered with 75mM NaCl for 6 weeks in short day conditions after which the fresh weight of the rosette was determined. In control conditions, the rosettes of HR-5 were significantly larger than the rosettes of Col-0, while no significant difference was observed between Col-0 and Cen-0 (Fig. 3E). The rosettes of Cen-0 plants grown at salt stress conditions were significantly larger than the Col-0 rosettes. When the relative difference in the rosette size was examined, Cen-0 showed no alteration of rosette size by salt stress, while rosette growth of HR-5 was hypersensitive to salt stress (Fig. 3E).Fig. 3.Natural variation in dry weight associates with LRR-KISS. (A) Genome wide association study performed on the dry weight of plants watered with 500mM NaCl with minor allele frequency of 0.01 showed an association with an SNP on chromosome 4. The identified SNP is circled in red. The association was not observed for any other trait or condition studied. (B) The SNP was located in the promoter region of At4g08850, encoding a leucine-rich repeat kinase-like protein. The natural variation in the promoter and gene-coding region was studied in 162 accessions sequenced by the 1001 Genomes Project belonging to the HapMap population (Supplementary Table S6). The red graph represents the portion of missing data, while the green graph represents deletions present in accessions other than Col-0. The blue graph represents the sequence similarity compared to Col-0. The open reading frames (ORFs) are represented in the lowest graph. The location of the SNP associated with dry weight at 500mM NaCl is represented with the dashed line. (C) The expression of At4g08850 is induced in the root after exposure to salt stress relative to expression in control conditions (Kilian et al., 2007) as reported by the eFP browser. (D) Natural variation in LRR-KISS (At4g08850) expression is enhanced in Cen-0 and reduced in HR-5 accessions relative to Col-0 (Lempe et al., 2005) as reported by the eFP browser. (E) The natural over-expression line Cen-0 and knock-down line HR-5 of LRR-KISS were tested for rosette growth in control and salt stress conditions. One-week-old plants grown under short-day conditions were treated with 0 or 75mM NaCl applied from above for 6 weeks. The fresh weight of the rosette was used as an indicator for growth and salinity tolerance. The bars represent the average fresh weight of the rosette as calculated from 15 biological replicates per line per conditions. The error bars represent standard error. The phenotypes of both accessions were tested for significant differences from Col-0, which were calculated using ANOVA with Tukeys post hoc test. The significance is indicated with * or ** for levels of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.Fresh weight of above-ground tissue collected from plants grown at 500mM NaCl was found to be associated with six loci (Table 3), of which one locus was associated with three SNPs with highest LOD score 12.6 (Fig. 4A). The SNPs associated with this locus were clustered in one region on chromosome 3 spanning genes At3g04600 and At3g04610, with At3g04605 encoding a member of the transposable element gene family, MUSTANG1. Since the association in this region could be due to the presence or absence of the transposable element, the natural variation in the MUSTANG1 sequence and neighbouring genes was examined for the 162 sequenced accessions of the HapMap population (Fig. 4B). Although transposable element MUSTANG1 was present in all accessions, a number of sites with low sequence similarity were observed. The region spanning At3g04610, encoding the flowering locus KH domain protein, was observed to exhibit high allelic variation across the entire gene-coding region. To validate the role of the genes adjacent to the locus most significantly associated with fresh weight at 500mM NaCl, five T-DNA insertion lines were studied with regard to changes in salt stress tolerance (Fig. 4C). In control conditions, one T-DNA insertion line in At3g04590 (fw2) and two T-DNA insertion lines in At3g04610 (fw5 and fw6) developed significantly smaller rosettes than reference line Col-0. Measuring the relative effect of salt stress on rosette size revealed that fw2, as well as fw5 and fw6, was less affected by salt stress. Those results suggest that genes in the region associated with fresh weight of plants grown under severe salt stress might contribute to growth maintenance in salt stress conditions. However, scarce availability of genetic resources for the candidate genes prevents identification of the genes/alleles causal to the association identified with GWAS.Fig. 4.Natural variation in fresh weight associates with a cluster of genes containing transposable element MUSTANG1. (A) Genome wide association study performed on the fresh weight of above-ground tissue collected from plants grown at 500mM NaCl using minor allele frequency of 0.01 showed an association with 10 SNPs in seven distinct genomic loci (Table 3). The highest association was observed for an SNP on chromosome 3, which neighboured two other SNPs with significant LOD scores. The associations were not observed for any other trait or condition studied. (B) The genetic variation in the region was studied in 162 accessions sequenced by the 1001 Genomes Project belonging to the HapMap population (Supplementary Table S6). The red graph represents the portion of missing data, while the green graph represents deletions present in accessions other than Col-0. The blue graph represents the sequence similarity compared to Col-0. The open reading frames (ORFs) are aligned in the lowest graph. The location of the SNPs associated with FW at 500mM NaCl is represented by the dashed lines. The SNPs were around At3g04605-encoding transposable element MUSTANG1, but were also found in At3g04600, encoding nucleotidylyl transferase superfamily protein, and At3g04610, encoding flowering locus KH domain. Considering the linkage disequilibrium, putative candidate genes were extended to At3g04590, encoding AT hook motif DNA-binding family protein. The association was further confirmed by studying five available T-DNA insertion lines, whose location is indicated in the graph representing the ORFs. The SALK numbers and primers used for genotyping are listed in Supplementary Table S5. (C) The T-DNA insertion lines were tested for rosette growth in control and salt stress conditions. One-week-old plants grown under short-day conditions were treated with 0 or 75mM NaCl applied from above for 6 weeks. The fresh weight of the rosette was used as an indicator of growth and salinity tolerance. The bars represent the average fresh weight of the rosette as calculated from 15 biological replicates per line per condition. The error bars represent standard error. The relative values were calculated by dividing the rosette FW at salt stress by average FW in control conditions. The phenotypes of T-DNA insertion lines were tested for significant differences from Col-0, which were calculated using ANOVA with Tukeys post hoc test. The significance is indicated with * or ** for levels of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.No significant associations with fresh or dry weight were found for the plants treated with 300mM NaCl. Instead, the ratio between fresh weight and rosette area was used as a proxy for water retention in shoot tissue and therefore salt stress tolerance. Five loci with relatively low minor allele frequency (<0.02) were associated with this trait (Table 3). One of the associated SNPs, with a LOD score of 7.6, was located on chromosome 1 (Fig. 5A). The SNP was located in the first exon of At1g25370 encoding an unknown protein. The analysis of sequence similarity in the promoter and gene-coding region revealed little genetic diversity in the coding region and a number of polymorphisms in the promoter region (Fig. 5B). Natural variation in At1g25370 expression was observed previously (Lempe et al., 2005), with Nok-1 showing reduced transcription (Fig. 5C). In order to examine the contribution of At1g25370 to salinity tolerance, this natural knockdown line, Nok-1, and a T-DNA insertion line (fwa2) (Fig. 5B) were examined for their rosette growth in control and salt stress conditions. Both fwa2 and Nok-1 showed reduced rosette size in control and salt stress conditions (Fig. 5D). Those results suggest that low expression of unknown gene At1g25370 results in reduced rosette growth that also hinders plant growth under salt stress conditions.Fig. 5.Natural variation in fresh weight per rosette area associates with unknown gene involved in rosette development. (A) Genome wide association study performed on the fresh weight per rosette area collected from plants grown at 300mM NaCl showed an association with five loci with low minor allele frequency above 0.02 (Table 3). One of the SNPs was located in the coding region of At1g25370, circled in red, encoding an unknown gene. The associations were not observed for any other trait or condition studied. (B) The natural variation in the region was studied in 162 accessions sequenced by the 1001 Genomes Project belonging to the HapMap population (Supplementary Table S6). The uppermost graph represents the portion of missing data, while the middle graph represents deletions present in accessions other than Col-0. The lowest graph represents the sequence similarity compared with Col-0. The open reading frames (ORFs) are aligned in the lowest graph. The location of the SNP associated with FW/PRA at 500mM NaCl is represented with the dashed line. The association was further confirmed by studying T-DNA insertion line, whose location is indicated in the graph representing the ORFs. The SALK number and primers used for genotyping are listed in Supplementary Table S5. (C) Natural variation in At1g25370 expression in previous studies revealed Nok-1 as a natural knockdown mutant (Lempe et al., 2005) as reported by the eFP browser. Different colours represent the relative expression compared with Col-0. (D) The natural knockdown line Nok-1 and T-DNA insertion line fwa2 were tested for rosette growth in control and salt stress conditions. One-week-old plants grown under short-day conditions were treated with 0 or 75mM NaCl applied from above for 6 weeks. The fresh weight of the rosette was used as an indicator of growth and salinity tolerance. The bars represent the average fresh weight of the rosette as calculated from 15 biological replicates per line per condition. The error bars represent standard error. The phenotypes of both lines were tested for significant differences from Col-0, which were calculated using ANOVA with Tukeys post hoc test. The significance is indicated with * or ** for levels of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively..

In the presence of EtOH, AlcR binds to and transcriptionally activates the alcA:35S promoter, driving expression of I-SceI. The T-DNA of vector pdao1 (B) contains left and right border sequences; a kanamycin selectable marker gene (neo); and a spacer region flanked by I-SceI target sites. The spacer region also contains three HincII sites (H). (C) Upon I-SceI expression the I-SceI sites are cleaved leading to the excision of the spacer region. DSB repair will then result in the joining of the cleaved sequences. This may result in direct joining of the I-SceI restriction sites, deletion of sequence on either side of the DSB or insertion of sequence at the site of DSB repair. These three types of repair can be distinguished by PCR using primers P1 (DSBF1) and P2 (DSBR1) that flank the site of DSB repair. Direct joining will result in an 834 bp product whilst deletion will result in a smaller product and insertion in a larger product. In the absence of DSB induction or when DSBs are repaired by HR the spacer region will not be excised resulting in a PCR product of 2.9 kb (B). Amplification of this product will be prevented by digesting template DNA with HincII.. . . . To generate DNA DSBs, tissues of interest in a transgenic plant hemizygous for both experimental transgene cassettes (Figure 1) were sprayed with ethanol to induce I-SceI expression which then introduced DSBs at the two restriction sites flanking the spacer region. Following DSB induction the plants were left for several days to allow DSB repair to take place, after which the tissue was harvested and DNA prepared. Individual junctions that had been repaired by NHEJ were then specifically amplified by single molecule PCR using primers flanking the two I-SceI sites. As each product was generated from a single template molecule, every amplicon represents a unique repair junction. Template molecules which contain the spacer region may have been repaired through homologous recombination using the sister chromatid as a template or, alternatively, these molecules may come from cells in which DSBs were not induced. These non-NHEJ template molecules were digested by HincII restriction of the spacer region such that they were not represented in the PCR products (Figure 1B). Repair events that lack the spacer region i.e. those events joining the two I-Sce-I sites to exclude the spacer (Figure 1C), will have arisen through NHEJ, as no chromosomal template molecule exists that is able to mediate such a repair via homologous recombination. These NHEJ-derived template molecules are not digested and remain intact, unless a de novo insert happens to contain HincII sites.. NHEJ repair junctions that result in no loss of sequence other than the excision of the spacer region will reform one I-SceI site from the two I-SceI half sites generated by the initial DSB induction (Figure 1C). These junctions generate PCR products of 834 bp (Figure 1C). PCR products larger or smaller than this result from NHEJ repair junctions involving insertions or deletions respectively (Figure 1C).. . . Generation of experimental lines. To establish the experimental system, two binary Agrobacterium transformation constructs, pdao1 and pAlcR:I-SceI, were generated. The pdao1 T-DNA contains neo for kanamycin selection and the spacer region containing a 35S promoter-driven dao1 gene flanked by two I-SceI target sites (Figure 1B). The pAlcR:I-SceI T-DNA contains hyg for hygromycin selection, AlcR driven by a 35S promoter and I-SceI driven by the ethanol inducible aclA:35S promoter [27] (Figure 1A). The pdao1 and pAlcR:ISceI constructs were individually transformed into Arabidopsis and tobacco by Agrobacterium transformation to generate D (pdao1) and A (pAlcR:ISceI) lines for both species. For Arabidopsis the nuclear location of the pdao1 T-DNA was determined by TAIL-PCR and comparison with the current Arabidopsis whole genome assembly (TAIR9).. Antibiotic resistant D and A line shoots (tobacco) or seedlings (Arabidopsis) were assayed by PCR to confirm the presence of the pdao1 and pAlcR:ISceI T-DNAs respectively. For PCR positive lines, T1 progeny from self fertilised T0 plants were grown on the appropriate antibiotic to determine segregation ratios in order to identify lines with single locus T-DNA insertions.. Homozygous, single locus, D line plants were crossed to homozygous, single locus, A line plants to generate doubly hemizygous progeny, providing the starting genotype for DSB induction. The doubly hemizygous lines were designated D4A2 (tobacco) and D19A26 (Arabidopsis).. . . dao1 enables dual selection in tobacco seedlings but not in tissue culture. The dual selectable marker gene encoding a D-amino acid oxidase (dao1) was included between flanking I-SceI sites to enable selection of seedlings or single cells in tissue culture for both the presence or absence of the spacer region. It was intended that this would be used in a complementary approach to identify NHEJ repair events. Effective use of dao1 has been demonstrated for both positive and negative selection of Arabidopsis seedlings [25] but its use in the selection of tobacco seedlings or in explant shoot regeneration was not previously demonstrated. Experiments showed that dao1 was effective for use both as a positive and a negative selectable marker gene for selection of germinating seedlings using concentrations of 10 mM D-alanine and 15-30 mM D-valine respectively as the selective agents (Text S1; Figures S1 and S2). In tissue culture, positive selection (D-alanine) but not negative selection (D-valine) was able to clearly distinguish between dao1 transgenic and wild-type explants. D-valine was therefore unsuitable for negative dao1 selection in tobacco explant regeneration (Text S1; Figures S3 and S4). As a result dao1 acts only as the essential spacer DNA in the current experiments.. . . Ethanol application leads to I-SceI expression and induction of DSBs. Prior to screening, the efficiency of ethanol induction of I-SceI was assessed. Leaf tissue was taken from the tobacco T0 A2 plant immediately prior to, and three days after, induction with 0.7 M ethanol. From these tissues RNA was prepared and cDNA synthesised for use in RT-PCR. A very faint gel band was observed for I-SceI mRNA prior to induction in leaf tissue (Figure 2A) indicating minimal leaky transcription in the absence of ethanol. After induction a strong band was observed (Figure 2A), indicating a marked increase in transcript accumulation in the presence of ethanol.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0032255.g002. Figure 2. . PCR analysis of DSB induction and repair.. (A) RT-PCR (+) demonstrates increased I-SceI mRNA accumulation after induction with 0.7 M ethanol in tobacco leaf tissue. Low levels of I-SceI mRNA accumulate in non-induced leaf tissue. No reverse transcriptase (-) and no template (-ve) controls are shown. Template control RT-PCRs used RPL25 mRNA primers. (B) The DSB region was PCR amplified from 4 tobacco D4A2 plants using primers DSBF1 and DSBR1 which flank the two I-SceI sites. Only the full length 2.9 kb band is amplified from template DNA extracted prior to DSB induction (NI). An additional 834 bp band is amplified from template DNA extracted after DSB induction (I). 834 bp is the expected size of the DSB region after excision of the spacer region. (C) After HincII digestion of induced template DNA only the 834 bp band is amplified. No amplification is observed from those molecules which have not undergone dao1 excision. Individual repair junctions were amplified by smPCR (D-F). The majority of products amplified were 834 bp in size. Some repair events resulted in deletions leading to products <834 bp (E) while others resulted in insertion leading to products >834 bp (F). Examples shown are amplified from D4A2#6I template DNA.. . . . Standard PCR was used initially to confirm that I-SceI expression resulted in the induction of DSBs and excision of the spacer region by NHEJ repair. DNA was prepared from tobacco leaf samples taken from experimental lines prior to and four days after ethanol induction. The DSB repair locus was then amplified using primers flanking the two I-SceI sites. A 2.9 kb band was expected from template molecules that had not undergone spacer excision or were repaired by HR (Figure 1B). An 834 bp band was expected from template molecules arising from NHEJ repair of DSBs without any associated insertion or deletion (Figure 1C).. A 2.9 kb band, resulting from amplification of the locus without dao1 excision, was observed for all DNA templates (Figure 2B). In addition a 834 bp product, reflecting excision of the spacer region, was amplified when using template DNA from I-SceI induced tissue (Figure 2B). As both 2.9 kb and 834 bp bands were present, it is evident that some template molecules originated from cells where DSBs were repaired by NHEJ and others were from cells repaired by HR (or where DSBs were not induced). Equivalent results indicated that DSB induction was efficient in Arabidopsis (data not shown).. . . HincII digest allows preferential amplification of junctions repaired by NHEJ. To favour amplification of repaired junctions arising specifically from NHEJ of DSBs, template samples were predigested with HincII which cuts three times within the spacer region but not in the flanking sequences between the I-SceI sites and primer binding sites (Figure 1B). Unavoidably digestion would also prevent amplification of template molecules arising from DSB repair events involving insertion of DNA containing HincII site(s). After HincII digestion only 834 bp products were amplified (Figure 2C).. . . Single molecule PCR. To amplify PCR products representing individual DSB repair junctions smPCR was used. For smPCR the template DNA was diluted until about two thirds of samples received no template molecules at all. This ensured that 80% of the reactions that did generate a PCR product did so from a single template molecule [28]. It was not possible to calculate the average template molecules in a given weight of DNA, as HincII digestion reduced the number of template molecules per unit weight DNA in a manner dependent upon the unknown efficiency of excision of the spacer region. Instead, a series of DNA concentrations were tested to arrive at the desired empirical concentration.. In tobacco, two independent doubly hemizygous plants (D4A2#2I and D4A2#6I) were tested using an optimised DNA concentration of 110-130 pg per reaction. This resulted in a product being amplified in 33-38% of reactions. For both plants this corresponds to one template molecule in 275 pg of genomic DNA, or one DSB repair by NHEJ in every 24 genomes. In Arabidopsis, one plant (D19A26#1I) was tested and a DNA concentration of 1 pg/reaction was chosen. This resulted in a product being amplified in 27% of reactions, corresponding to one template molecule in 3.7 pg, or, one DSB repair by NHEJ in every 9 genomes [29]. These results clearly indicate efficient induction of DSBs and subsequent NHEJ repair.. . . Arabidopsis and tobacco have similar patterns of non-homologous DNA repair. 389 and 311 unique repair junctions were amplified in tobacco and Arabidopsis respectively. The majority of PCR products were 834 bp in length (Figure 2D): the size expected with simple joining of the two I-SceI half sites (Figure 1C). For both species 1.5% of PCR products were significantly smaller, corresponding to large (>50 bp) deletions (one example is shown in Figure 2E) and 1.5% were significantly larger indicating net insertions (one example is shown in Figure 2F). Deletions that resulted in the loss of one or both primer binding sites would not have been observed in this analysis such that a maximum symmetrical deletion size of 750 bp could be amplified by PCR using these primers. As a result, 1.3-1.5% is a minimum estimate of the proportion of repair events that involve large deletions. In addition amplification of junction sequences involving insertions would not be possible if the insert was too large for PCR or if the insert contained a HincII restriction site. 1.5% is therefore a conservative estimate of proportion of repair events involving insertion. Occasionally, a 2.9 kb product was amplified from a template molecule containing the spacer region which had not been digested by HincII (data not shown) demonstrating that inserts of at least 2 kb could be amplified effectively using this method.. For both plant species, all the insertion events recovered together with 20 randomly chosen smPCR products were sequenced. The smPCR products sequenced that were clearly the result of reactions containing more than one template molecule (20%) were discarded. In tobacco and Arabidopsis respectively, 45% (9/20) and 75% (15/20) of repair junctions without insertion resulted in no loss of sequence due to simple ligation of the two I-SceI half sites (Figure 3A and 3C) excluding the spacer region. Comparable experiments in mammals showed a similar percentage (40%) of I-SceI site reformation [30]. Two junctions in tobacco were joined by inexact ligation of the two 4 bp I-SceI half site overhangs, resulting in the addition of an extra nucleotide. The remaining junctions, 45% (9/20) for tobacco and 25% (5/20) for Arabidopsis had small (1-45 bp) deletions (Figure 3A and 3C). In some instances micro-homology was observed between the terminal bases of the fragments being joined (Figure 3A and 3C) although there was no indication that the amount of micro-homology observed was greater than that expected by chance.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0032255.g003. Figure 3. . Sequence of double strand break repair events.. The sequence surrounding the junction sites is shown for 20 randomly chosen repair products (tobacco, A; Arabidopsis, C), and the repair products that harboured insertions (tobacco, B; Arabidopsis, D). The original sequence generated by I-SceI cleavage is shown at the top of A-D (the sequence of both strands is shown). Bases from the I-SceI site upstream of dao1 are shown in red, bases from the I-SceI site downstream of dao1 are shown in green. Inserted bases are shown in blue. In some instances microhomology was observed between the terminal bases of the fragments being joined (bold italics). Columns to the right of A-D indicate the total length of deletion (-), insertion (+) and microhomology (MH, not including I-SceI site overlap), nt signifies not testable, F indicates the insertion of filler DNA. Numbers in brackets indicate length of deletion or microhomology observed at the junction either upstream (L) or downstream (R) of the insertion. In tobacco the median deletion size was considerably larger in DSB repair events involving insertion than in repair events not involving insertion (E). The box-and-whisker plot shows the median (red line), the first and third quartiles, and the upper and lower limits of the length of deletions (two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test).. . . . In both tobacco and Arabidopsis the average deletion size (14 bp and 9 bp respectively) was much smaller than the average insertion size (95 bp and 274 bp respectively). However, as deletions occurred far more frequently than insertions, there was no net loss or gain of sequence at sites of DSB repair in either species.. . . Sequences inserted at sites of DSB repair are nuclear in origin. The six insertions in tobacco ranged from 127-677 bp in length (Figure 3B; Table 1) and in all cases insertion was accompanied by deletion of the starting sequence (Figure 3B). Part of insertion NTI1 shared 97% identity with the Arabidopsis isoleucine tRNA gene suggesting that it may be SINE-derived sequence [31]. All other inserts showed partial identity to uncharacterised EST clones from tobacco or other Solanaceous species (Table 1), indicating that all insertions were probably of nuclear origin. The four insertions in Arabidopsis ranged from 80 to 534 bp in length (Figure 3D; Table 2). Insertion ATI1 originated from an intergenic region on chromosome 1. The DSB locus in line D19 is located on chromosome 5 indicating that insertion ATI1 did not originate from an adjacent or remote syntenic region. Insertion ATI2 was accompanied by a large deletion upstream of the left hand I-SceI site (Figure 3D). The insert was derived from part of this deleted region but was inserted in the opposite polarity. ATI3 also originated from DNA found upstream of the left hand I-SceI recognition sequence (-33 to -352). This sequence was inserted in the same orientation as the original sequence, effectively generating a tandem duplication. Insertion ATI4 was derived from the region excised between the two I-SceI sites. This 498 bp section of the spacer region did not contain any HincII sites, enabling this junction to be amplified by smPCR. This observation implies that similar insertions of segments of the spacer region may have occurred but were missed in this screen through HincII digestion.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0032255.t001.

In both Arabidopsis and tobacco, short stretches of filler DNA (1-36 bp) were inserted at some junctions (Figure S5). Filler DNA was usually derived from a short stretch, or multiple stretches, of nearby sequence that probably primed ligation (Figure S5). Filler DNA has been associated previously with the insertion of T-DNA [32] and organelle DNA [18] suggesting that both integrate during repair of nuclear DSBs.. . . Insertion at sites of DSB repair in tobacco is associated with genomic deletion and increased micro-homology at the sequence junctions. In tobacco, the median size of deletion was found to be significantly larger in DSB repair events involving insertion than in those that did not (Figure 3E, p=0.003, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test). DSB repair events that resulted in direct ligation of the two I-SceI half sites where excluded from this analysis as the two I-SceI half sites have complementary 4 bp single stranded overlaps that may promote joining without deletion. In addition, only those DSB repair events harbouring insertions >1 bp were included.. Investigation of the presence of micro-homology at repair junctions involving insertion was possible for six junctions. At these, the bases flanking the insert sequence in its original context could be inferred from the EST sequence to which the insert matched. For the other junctions, BLAST searches only identified accessions with limited identity to the insert sequence, preventing unequivocal assessment of micro-homology. This is a limitation of analyses such as this where the sequence from which the insert originates is unknown. Five of the six junctions that could be assessed showed micro-homology (2-7 bp, Figure 3B). The remaining junction showed a 1 bp insertion of filler DNA (Figure 3B, Figure S5). Overall the level of micro-homology observed in insertion repair events was greater than that expected by chance (p=0.048, n=6, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test). The presence of large deletions and micro-homology at repair junctions is indicative of insertion via MMEJ or SDSA..
PMC2736899	Results. . Loss-of-function ETR2 mutants display altered trichome branching. To determine if any of the Arabidopsis ethylene receptor GOF or LOF mutants had altered trichome development, as compared to the wild type (Columbia), mutant lines of all five Arabidopsis receptors were screened. Only LOF mutations to the ETR2 receptor caused trichome branching abnormalities among the ethylene receptor mutants tested (etr1-1, etr1-5, etr1-6, etr1-7, ers1-1, ers1-3, ers2-1, ers2-3, etr2-1, etr2-2, etr2-3, ein4-1, ein4-4, ein4-7). Wild-type rosette leaves in Arabidopsis have 1% two-branched trichomes, 97% three-branched trichomes, and 2% four-branched trichomes (as measured on leaf 5; n=798 trichomes). The LOF mutants of ETR2 differed from the wild type (Fig. 1). While the GOF mutant, etr2-1 (Fig. 1B), had trichomes similar to the wild type (Fig. 1A), with 2% two-branched trichomes, 93% three-branched trichomes, and 5% four-branched trichomes (n=950 trichomes), etr2-2 (a LOF mutant; Fig. 1C) lacked four-branched trichomes and instead had 17% two-branched trichomes, and 83% three-branched trichomes (n=1349 trichomes). The most altered phenotype was observed in the LOF mutant etr2-3 (Fig. 1D), which had 100% unbranched trichomes (n=1253 trichomes). This was true on rosette leaves, flowering stalks, and on sepals, as compared to the wild type which has both two-branched and unbranched trichomes on the flowering stalks and sepals. Representative images of the wild type, etr2-1, etr2-2, and etr2-3 are shown in Fig. 1.. . Fig. 1.. . Representative trichome branching in wild type and three etr2 mutants. Trichomes of the wild type are predominantly three-branched (A) as are trichomes of etr2-1 (B). The etr2-2 mutant has a higher number of two-branched trichomes (C) while etr2-3 has only unbranched trichomes (D). Scale bars=200 mum.. . . . It has previously been shown that ETR2 is expressed in mature leaves (Sakai et al., 1998; Grefen et al., 2008). Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing an ETR2pro:GUS construct were created to determine if there is a cellular specific expression related to trichomes. It was found in all 13 lines recovered that ETR2 is expressed in juvenile leaves, and that GUS expression was observed in young trichomes in half of these lines (Fig. 2A). During leaf expansion, ETR2 expression became restricted to trichomes (Fig. 2B), while in fully expanded leaves no GUS staining was found in either the leaf epidermal cells or trichomes as has also been shown by Jakoby et al. (2008). These data demonstrate that ETR2 is expressed in trichomes early in development during which the initiation of trichome branching occurs.. . Fig. 2.. . ETR2 is expressed in young leaves and mature trichomes. (A) ETR2pro:GUS is expressed in very young leaves and trichomes (Scale bar=1 mm). (B) ETR2pro:GUS is restricted to fully branched trichomes only (Scale bar=1 mm).. . . . . . Microtubule cytoskeleton organization is altered in etr2-3. To date, mutations that cause a reduction in trichome branching either affect the level of endoreduplication within the cell or the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton (Mathur and Chua, 2000). Trichomes were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to determine the DNA content of etr2-3 trichomes as compared to the wild type. Epidermal pavement cells generally have between 2C and 16C of DNA, while trichomes have between 4C to 64C, with the majority containing an average of 32C (Melaragno et al., 1993). It was found that average DNA content between etr2-3 and wild-type trichomes was not significantly different (Fig. 3A; P<0.05). This indicates that ETR2 affects trichome branching in an endoreduplication-independent manner.. . Fig. 3.. . ETR2 affects microtubule assembly. (A) Both wild-type (black bar) and etr2-3 (grey bar) nuclei show the same level of endoreduplication (P<0.05, t test). (B) Wild-type trichomes expressing 35S:MAP4-GFP show a longitudinal fine mesh of microtubules (scale bar=50 mum). Inset is a magnification of longitudinally oriented microtubules in the stalk of the trichome. (C) Some etr2-335S:MAP4-GFP trichomes nearing maturity show disorganized microtubule cytoskeleton and early signs of depolymerization at the base of the trichome (scale bar=30 mum). Inset is a magnification of disorganized microtubule assembly discussed in the text. (D) Branching is induced in etr2-3 when treated with 20 muM paclitaxol for 2 h and then grown on MS medium until new leaves are produced (scale bar=100 mum). (E) etr2-335S:MAP4-GFP lines which express the highest level of MAP4-GFP show trichome branching and normal microtubule assembly (scale bar=70 mum). (F) Oryzalin causes depolymerization of microtubules and induces unbranched root hairs to become branched (inset). Bar chart of dose-response of the wild type (grey bars), etr2-3 (black bars), and etr2-1 (white bars) to different oryzalin concentrations. Asterisk indicates statistically significant difference from the wild type (P<0.05, t test).. . . . Assembly and structural arrangement of microtubules are maintained in part by MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEINs (MAPs) (Igarashi et al., 2000; Smertenko et al., 2000). This association has been exploited through the use of a GFP-labelled MAP4 protein to image the microtubule cytoskeleton in a number of living plant cell types (Olson et al., 1994; Marc et al., 1998). To image the microtubule cytoskeleton in developing trichomes, etr2-3 was crossed with transgenic Arabidopsis expressing 35S:MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN4-GFP (35S:MAP4-GFP). Overexpression of the MAP4 has also been shown to cause stabilization of microtubule assembly (Marc et al., 1998). In 35S:MAP4-GFP lines this can lead to artefacts such as bulging hypocotyl cells, thickened trichomes or induced trichome branching. Despite this drawback, with careful screening these lines have been widely used throughout the literature (Olson et al., 1995; Marc et al., 1998; Kragler et al., 2003; Shevchenko et al., 2008). The etr2-3 35S:MAP4-GFP double mutants were therefore carefully screened for lines which did not display these artefacts. It was found that in the early stages of wild-type trichome outgrowth, the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton appears to criss-cross the stalk of the trichome. A similar pattern was observed in very young trichomes of etr2-3. Following trichome branching, the microtubule cytoskeleton re-aligns into a longitudinal orientation (Fig. 3B, inset). It is at this stage that differences between wild-type and etr2-3 trichomes were observed. While some of the etr2-3 trichomes showed normal longitudinal microtubules in nearly mature trichomes, a subset of trichomes exhibited a random and disorganized microtubule network that showed evidence of depolymerization (Fig. 3C, inset). Trichomes of etr2-3 also lacked the dense knots of microtubules typically present in branching trichomes. There was no visible GFP signal in fully mature etr2-3 trichomes. Thus, microtubule assembly in etr2-3 trichomes nearing maturity do not consistently show the same organization as in the wild type.. In previously characterized mutants that show altered microtubule assembly, it has been shown that pharmacological stabilization of microtubules can induce branching in trichomes (Mathur and Chua, 2000). When etr2-3 was treated with high concentrations of paclitaxol, a known stabilizer of microtubule assembly (Schiff et al., 1979; De Brabander et al., 1981; Verde et al., 1991; Hyman and Karsenti, 1998), approximately 50% of the trichomes developed branch initials or unbranched stalks with incipient branch bulges (Fig. 3D). The cytoskeleton of 2 etr2-3, 35S:MAP4-GFP double mutant lines that were identified as having a highly stabilized microtubule cytoskeleton (evidenced by bulging hypocotyl cells, intense GFP signal, as well as a mixture of unbranched and branched trichomes) were also analysed. The two-branched trichomes in these lines had blunt-ended branch tips, a phenotype that has been associated with stabilized microtubules in sti (Mathur and Chua, 2000) and the microtubule cytoskeleton appeared normal (Fig. 3E). Therefore stabilization of microtubule assembly by either overexpression of MAP4 or application of paclitaxol can partially rescue the etr2-3 mutant phenotype.. If the etr2-3 mutant is affected in the assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton, it should be possible to disrupt cytoskeletal assembly more easily in the etr2-3 mutant compared to the wild type. This was studied by treating etr2-1, etr2-3, and the wild type with increasing concentrations of oryzalin. Oryzalin has been shown to depolymerize microtubules, leading to root hair branching, an increase in the girth of trichomes, and alteration of the shape of the root tip (Baskin et al., 1994). While analysis of root hair branching is not directly associated with trichome branching, branching of the root hairs can be accurately quantified and used to support our findings that cytoskeletal assembly is impaired in these mutants. In MS media, etr2-3 had a higher number of branched root hairs than the wild type (Fig. 3F). Three days after the addition of 0.1 muM oryzalin to the media, the number of branched root hairs in etr2-3 increased significantly as compared to the wild type or etr2-1 (P<0.05). The wild type required a concentration of 1.0 muM oryzalin before a significant increase in root hair branching was detected. By contrast, the GOF mutant etr2-1, had a significantly lower number of branched root hairs at 1.0 muM oryzalin compared to the wild type (P<0.05). Therefore, LOF and GOF mutations to ETR2 have opposite effects on the sensitivity to oryzalin.. . . Epistatic crosses and expression analysis place ETR2 in the trichome development pathway. The etr2-3 mutant was crossed with several trichome branching mutants to gain insight into the position of ETR2 in the known trichome morphogenesis signalling pathway. Representative pictures of the original mutants (Fig. 4B, D, F, H, J) and the resulting double mutants (Fig. 4C, E, G, I, K, L) are shown and percentages of branch types are shown in Table 1. When crossed with glabra3 (gl3), which has two-branched trichomes (Fig. 4B), the double mutant had puddle-like, unbranched trichomes that grew parallel to the leaf surface (Fig. 4C). When crossed with spy-5 (Fig. 4D), a mutant in the gibberellin pathway with increased trichome branching, the resulting double mutant had a mixture of two- and three-branched trichomes (Fig. 4E). Crossing of etr2-3 with glabra2 (gl2) (Fig. 4F) resulted in leaves with a mixture of two branched and unbranched trichomes (Fig. 4G). The glabra2 and etr2-3 glabra2 double mutants have approximately the same proportion of unbranched and two branched trichomes (Table 1). There were, however, distinct differences in the morphology of the trichomes between gl2 and the double mutant. Trichomes of the double mutant were fully extended and sharp tipped. Conversely, trichomes on the first leaves of gl2 either did not fully extend (for unbranched trichomes) or showed a high proportion of branched trichomes with very short branches. When etr2-3 was crossed to fasciata1 (fas1), a loss-of-function mutation to CAF1 that has trichomes with increased branching (Fig. 4H), the resulting double mutant had 100% unbranched trichomes (Fig. 4I). Based on the epistatic relationship between FAS1 and ETR2, etr2-3 was crossed to try, a mutant with clumped trichomes that exhibits supernumerary branches. The try etr2-3 double mutant had unbranched trichomes that, in a few cases appeared clumped (Fig. 4K). A cross was also performed between fas1-1 and try and the double mutant had the trichome branching and clustering phenotype of try (Fig. 4L). Taken together, these results suggest that ETR2 signals in a pathway that is parallel to GL2, GL3, and gibberellic acid, but that ETR2 operates in the same pathway as CAF1 and TRY.. . Table 1.. .

To characterize further how ETR2 affects the expression of genes involved in the regulation of trichome branching, the expression levels of five key trichome branching regulators were analysed (Fig. 4M). Expression was performed in etr2-1, etr2-3, and fas1-1 and compared to their respective wild type (Col-0 for the first two mutants and Enk-2 for fas1-1). Because epistatic analysis suggested that ETR2 signals in the same pathway as CAF1, the expression level of FAS1 in the etr2-3 and etr2-1 mutants was also tested. It was found that expression levels of FAS1 in etr2-3 were significantly increased, while they were not significantly affected in etr2-1 (P<0.05). This would support the epistatic results which suggest that ETR2 acts upstream of CAF1. It was found that TRY expression was significantly increased in etr2-3, while it was significantly repressed in etr2-1 (Fig. 4M). In the fas1-1 mutant TRY expression is also significantly repressed. As TRY is a known regulator of STI and ZWI, the expression patterns of these two genes were considered. It was determined that STI was significantly down-regulated in etr2-3 and increased in etr2-1 but was unaffected in fas1-1. There was no significant difference in expression of ZWI in any of the mutants tested. As a control, the level of expression of AN was tested as it is a gene known to be in a separate trichome branching pathway from TRY, and presumably unaffected by ETR2. The expression levels in both ethylene mutants was not significantly different from the wild type (Fig. 4M). These data confirm that ETR2 is in the same signalling pathway as CAF1 and that downstream components of this regulatory network are TRY and STI..
PMC4105546	Results. . Dynamic regulatory network reconstruction with co-expression data and regulatory interactions. We reconstructed the regulatory network of secondary metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana through combining co-expressed gene pairs with regulatory interactions (Figure. 1A): either 422,967 predicted regulatory interactions from AthaMap. [41], which were then filtered by conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs); or 10,653 directly experiment-proved ones from AGRIS. [42,43].. We first used conserved TFBSs (see Methods) to increase the confidence of regulatory interactions predicted in AthaMap from the perspective of evolution. As expected, poplar (the closest species to Arabidopsis among four used organisms in the evolutionary tree) had more conserved TFBSs. In contrast, we did not find any conserved TFBSs among TB orthologous genes in chlamydomonas (the farthest species to Arabidopsis among four used organisms in the evolutionary tree)-possibly owing to large evolutionary distance between them. This verifies the rationale of our results in conserved TFBSs computing.Next, 72,416,247 significantly co-expressed gene pairs and 14,306,661 most significantly co-expressed gene pairs were obtained from microarray analysis (Figure. 1B). Based on these co-expressed gene pairs, we identified a substantial amount of active regulatory interactions to construct regulatory network. 28% of regulatory interactions from AthaMap were maintained after being filtered with significantly co-expressed gene pairs. At the same time, among the regulatory interactions from AGRIS database, about 39% were significantly co-expressed and 6% were most significantly co-expressed-consistent with the fundamental assumption of regulatory interaction prediction: expression patterns of TFs and their target genes were similar.To validate our filtering strategies of AthaMap data, we compared the proportion of direct regulatory interactions (AGRIS) in the predicted ones (AthaMap) across different data filtering strategies (Figure. 2A) with five TFs: FUS3 (AT3G26790), AtLEC2 (AT1G28300), AG (AT4G18960), AGL15 (AT5G13790) and HY5 (AT5G11260) in both AGRIS and AthaMap. After being filtered by only TFBSs alignments or significant co-expressed gene pairs, the percentages of direct regulatory interactions were 5.46% and 4.26% respectively. When being filtered by both TFBSs alignments and significantly co-expressed gene pairs, the fraction of direct regulatory interactions increased to 12.10%. After adding evolutionary conservation filtering, this percentage reached 14.53%. Therefore, our filtering methods were efficient in predicting highly confident regulatory interactions.. . Figure 2. . Validation of filtering method in identifying high confident regulatory interactions. (A) The percentages of experiment-confirmed regulatory interactions in regulatory interactions predicted by different data. To validate the filtering strategies of AthaMap data, the proportion of direct regulatory interactions (AGRIS) in the predicted ones (AthaMap) across different data filtering strategies were computed with the regulatory interactions of five TFs: FUS3 (AT3G26790), AtLEC2 (AT1G28300), AG (AT4G18960), AGL15 (AT5G13790) and HY5 (AT5G11260) present in both AGRIS and AthaMap. (B) Literature evidences about the function of TFs target pathways that were consistent with phenotypes of TFs mutant. The function of TFs target pathways were mined in literatures. The phenotypes of TFs mutant were obtained from AtPID (Arabidopsis thaliana Protein Interactome Database). The percentages of target pathways whose functions were consistent to TFs mutant phenotypes were computed.. . . . To verify that our processed regulatory interactions are more confident than raw regulatory interactions, we first compared the numbers of target pathways in these two datasets. We observed that the numbers of target pathways in our result were smaller than that in both raw dataset and random dataset (Additional file. 3: Figure S1A). And the raw dataset was not significantly different from random dataset compared with our processed data (Additional file. 3: Figure S1B). Furthermore, to validate the reliability of our proposed method in eliminating low confident data in raw dataset, we mined function of pathways (containing predicted target genes) from literatures and checked their consistency with TFs mutant-phenotypes in ATPID database. [44]. Here we only chose TFs with simple mutant-phenotypes (Additional file. 4: Table S3) to make the result more precise, ignoring complex mutant-phenotypes associated with multiple functions. The percentages of literature evidences in our processed data were higher than that in the raw dataset (Figure. 2B): for each TF, functions of more than half target pathways in processed regulatory interactions were correlated with mutant-phenotype. In our results, CDC5 (AT1G09770, cell division cycle 5, a MYB family member) regulated 24 pathways, and 19 of them were correlated with embryo development in literatures-in accordance with embryonic defect, the phenotype of CDC5 mutant in ATPID. AGL9 (AT1G24260, agamous-like 9, a member of SEP3 family), whose mutant-phenotype was about flowers in ATPID, regulated 57 pathways in our result, and 40 of target pathways were associated with flowers in literatures. AtLEC2 mutant affected normal embryonic and cotyledonal development in ATPID, 17 of the 19 pathways which were predicted to be regulated by AtLEC2 were related to this TFs mutant-phenotype. These results indicate that our method is efficient in identifying highly confident regulatory interactions from raw dataset.. . . Regulatory rewiring under diverse conditions in TB. Based on the dynamic regulatory network, we analyzed regulatory rewiring to demonstrate the dynamic changes of regulation. In pathway level, according to the regulation of TFs on target genes, we classified regulations into three types: positive, negative or both positive and negative. Positive or negative regulation of a TF on a pathway signifies that the regulations on different pathway genes are constant and dont change with experiments. Both positive and negative regulation, considered as inconstant and reciprocal regulation on different target enzymatic genes, maintains the balance of metabolic flux within pathways. For example, abscisic acid glucose ester biosynthesis contains only one reaction, and the reaction is catalyzed by abscisic acid glucosyltransferase that is encoded by more than 20 genes. We found both positive and negative regulations of RAV1 (AT1G13260, an AP2/B3 domain TF) on this pathway, which could keep abscisic acid glucosyltransferase steady.. Since TB is critical to plant, we took two examples in TB sub-network to illustrate regulatory rewiring under diverse experimental conditions. Generally, the occurrence of rewiring is caused by either regulatory interactions between TFs or regulatory alterations under different conditions.. One example is the rewiring between the regulatory crosstalk of RAV1 and ATHB1 (AT3G01470, a HD-ZIP family member) on HMG1 (AT1G76490, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase). RAV1 positively regulated HMG1 gene in independence (Additional file. 3: Figure S2A) under many conditions: the grown stage of leaves; tocopherols mutant VTE1 (vitamin E deficient 1) gene; tocopherols mutant VTE2 (vitamin E deficient 2) gene; leaves responses to Phytophthora infestans and COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenic 9) signalosome mutants grown in dark, etc. However, the positive regulation role of RAV1 on HMG1 gene altered when ATHB1 promoted the expression of HMG1 gene (Additional file. 3: Figure S2B) under a few conditions, like ABA1 (zeaxanthin epoxidase) gene mutant and hypoxia stress. We found that the distance between two TFs binding sites of HMG1 gene was within 200bps, suggesting that the binding of ATHB1 on HMG1 gene affect normal binding of RAV1, and thereby change RAV1s usual regulatory function. It implies that the interactions between these two TFs result in the alteration of RAV1 regulation on HMG1 gene.. The example of epoxysqualene biosynthesis also demonstrates the rewiring of regulatory crosstalk (Additional file. 3: Figure S3). Epoxysqualene biosynthesis pathway is the upstream pathway, leading to sterol biosynthesis (a major class of triterpenoids) and other triterpenoids biosynthesis. The regulations of RAV1 on epoxysqualene biosynthesis and sterol biosynthesis pathways were the same in multiple experiments: Phytophthora infestans plants, water treatment on leaves for 24hours, MgCl2 treatment on leaves for 12hours, etc. But RAV1 regulated the two pathways differently under a few conditions (such as seedling and CSN3 gene mutant in dark): negatively regulated epoxysqualene biosynthesis but positively regulated sterol biosynthesis, because of the activation of some downstream biosynthetic genes regulated by RAV1 in sterol biosynthesis pathway. The change of RAV1s regulation would affect normal metabolic distribution of sterol-related and the other triterpenoids, indicating the importance of regulatory rewiring in controlling metabolic flux.. . . Variability of genes expressions revealing regulatory rewiring. Significant variability in expressions of TF-encoding and pathway genes could further reveal regulatory rewiring by providing gene activities and functions specific to experimental conditions. We investigated the changes of gene activities and functions through differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (see Methods).Biosynthetic genes of FB, PDB and TB were significantly differentially expressed in tissue experiments (Figure. 3), suggesting their dramatic changes in biological development of specific tissues. On the contrary, genes in NSCB were significantly differentially expressed in genotype experiments, indicating notable activities and biological function of nitrogen-containing compounds in plants of different genotypes.. . Figure 3. . The contrasts of six experiment categories for five secondary metabolic classes. Within every metabolic class, DEGs numbers were counted for each experiment; and experiments were then ranked by DEGs numbers. Experiments above the top ten percent were used to compute the percentages of six experiment categories: tissue, stage, genotype, chemical, biotic and abiotic.. . . . The expressions of TF-encoding genes were also different under different experimental conditions. On one hand, genes-primary in WRKY(Zn), NAC, AP2/EREBP and MYB TF families-were widely differentially expressed (Additional file. 3: Figure S4), indicating their global roles in regulations of downstream TFs or target enzymatic genes. In WRKY(Zn) family, WRKY18 (AT4G31800) and WRKY40 (AT1G80840) (which were induced by pathogen). [45], were greatly differentially expressed in genotype and chemical experiments; whereas WRKY6 (AT1G62300, associated with leaf senescence and defense). [46] was significantly differentially expressed in tissue and chemical treatments. Compared with WRKY(Zn) family, stress induced NAC family members (ANAC072, AT4G27410; ANAC019, AT1G52890; ANAC055, AT3G15500). [47] were differentially expressed in grown stages. On the other hand, TFs only differentially expressed in a few experiments included E2F/DP family (regulating core cell cycle). [48], C2H2(Zn) family (controlling flowering, germination and root development). [49-51] and ABI3/VP1 family (governing seed maturation). [52]. Those TFs were possibly more specific to particular conditions. For instance, a member of E2F/DP family (E2Ff, AT3G01330) was more specific to genotype experiments; whereas a member of C2H2(Zn) family (ID1, AT1G25250) was more typical to tissues.. To explore the relationship between TFs and pathway genes, we clustered them by expression profiles under different experiment categories and took TB as an example (Additional file. 3: Figure S5). Firstly, we could not distinguish TFs and biosynthetic genes by two separated clusters. Secondly, one cluster was a union of similarly expressed genes, and contained both TFs and enzymatic genes, suggesting potential regulations between them in a cluster. Thirdly, clusters were different under five experiment categories, indicating variability of potential regulations depending on experimental conditions. This variability reflects biodiversity to a certain extent, which is in accordance with regulatory rewiring-emphasizing the reasons of biological complexity.. . . Explanation of regulatory rewiring by network topology. Network topological properties could efficiently explain regulatory rewiring based on network structure (Figure. 4, Additional file. 3: Figure S6-S9). We compared the general network properties of five secondary metabolic classes (Table. 1). The numbers of TFs, genes and regulatory interactions in TB were the highest, indicating that the regulation of TB was the most complicated. In contrast, these topology properties in SDB were the lowest, revealing that the regulation of SDB was the simplest. The number of positive regulations was larger than that of negative regulations, and the number of inconsistent regulations was the least, which was discovered in network motifs as well. In addition, the network motifs (the basic component of the network) with high frequencies contained more positive regulations than negative regulations and inconsistent regulations, showing that most regulations were invariant (Additional file. 3: Figure S10).. . Figure 4. . Regulatory network of TB pathways. Three types of regulation are presented in the network.

Since high degree nodes are important in maintaining network structure whereas closeness gives a rough indication of how well a node connects the network, we used degree and closeness to explore the functions of pathways and TFs. We found that the nodes with high degree were also high in closeness (Additional file. 3: Figure S11A). Interestingly, almost all nodes with both high degrees and closeness were TFs, while pathways always had low degree and closeness, indicating that TFs play a key role in maintaining the structure of network.. It is intriguing which factor affects the numbers of TFs in network. We discovered that the number of TFs was correlated with the number of genes in this pathway (Additional file. 3: Figure S11B): the fewer genes in a pathway, the fewer TFs regulating this pathway, suggesting simpler regulation of this pathway. Besides, similar distributions of TFs numbers (Additional file. 3: Figure S12) and pathway genes numbers (Additional file. 3: Figure S13) in terpenoids metabolism also demonstrate the relevance; and the two numbers were all correlated with topological property. For example, one gene pathways (such as beta-caryophtllene biosynthesis, delta-carotene biosynthesis and arabidiol biosynthesis) were regulated by a small number of TFs, indicating simple regulations; and these pathways were not critical to metabolic network, because of their low degrees in topology (shown as small nodes with light color in Additional file. 3: Figure S12-13). However, pathways with more genes (like genranylgeranyl diphosphate, nonaprenyl diphosphate biosynthesis and epoxysqualene biosynthesis) were regulated by more than 20 TFs and were hub pathways in terpeniod metabolism (shown as large nodes with deep color in Additional file. 3: Figure S12-13). The regulations of these pathways were complicated so that perplexing regulatory rewiring often occurred and led metabolic fluxes flowing into disparate downstream pathways. In other words, regulatory rewiring happened with changing conditions, and in turn affected metabolic flux within inner pathway or between different downstream pathways. These examples demonstrate that both simple and complex regulations can adapt to function of metabolic pathways, either specific or extensive.. . . Contribution of TFs upstream signaling pathways to regulatory rewiring. Since signaling pathways regulate the activities of TFs, they contribute to TFs regulatory rewiring. To define upstream signaling influences on TFs, we computed significances of expression correlations between plant signaling pathway genes and TFs (see Methods, Additional file. 3: Figure S14). Plant signaling molecules are mainly metabolites, such as jasmonate (fatty acid derivatives biosynthesis), ethylene (methionine biosynthesis), brassinosteroid (terpenoids biosynthesis) and cytokinin (terpenes biosynthesis). We found that TFs involved in certain signaling pathways were truly significantly co-expressed with related signaling pathway genes. For example, AtMYC2 (AT1G32640, a MYC-related transcriptional activator), in the downstream of jasmonate signaling pathway, was significantly correlated with genes in this pathway; ARR1 (AT3G16857, response regulator 1) and ARR2 (AT4G16110, response regulator 1), activated by cytokinin indirectly, were significantly co-expressed with cytokinin signaling pathway genes. These results indicate the efficiency of predicting TFs upstream signaling pathways. Totally we found that 50 TFs were significantly correlated with 3 signaling pathways (Additional file. 5: Table S4). Among the three signaling pathways, jasmonate and cytokinin signaling pathways were correlated with 45 TFs and 31 TFs respectively while ethylene signaling pathway was only correlated with 12 TFs: suggesting global regulatory function of jasmonate and cytokinin compared to ethylene. In addition, 11 TFs were correlated with three signaling pathways, and 16 TFs were associated with both jasmonate and cytokinin signaling pathways-indicating complicated regulations of signaling pathways on these TFs. Besides, the rest 23 TFs were correlated with only one signaling pathway, implying specific regulations of signaling pathways on these TFs. For example, RAV1 was significantly correlated with cytokinin signaling pathway, demonstrating potential regulation of cytokinin on RAV1. Here, the identification and summary of potential signaling pathways for TFs could largely improve the understanding of TFs regulatory rewiring..
PMC3409070	Results. . FLN1 and FLN2 loss-of-function mutants have severe chlorotic phenotypes. We took a reverse genetics approach and analyzed the available T-DNA insertion alleles to identify the role of each FLN in plant growth and development. We analyzed one FLN1 and two FLN2 insertion alleles (Figure 1A). Progeny from plants heterozygous for each T-DNA allele were assessed for segregation of any observable phenotypes after germination of seed and subsequent growth on GM plates. Two phenotypes were observed; each line segregated 3:1 for a green:pale/chlorotic phenotype (chi2 goodness-of-fit test for 3:1 segregation: fln1-1, chi2=3.5, p-value=0.060; fln2-1 chi2=0.086, p-value=0.76; fln2-2, chi2=0.030, p-value=0.86. PCR-based genotyping revealed that the pale/chlorotic seedlings are homozygous for their respective T-DNA insertion.. . Figure 1. .

We confirmed the T-DNA insertion position for each allele with PCR and DNA sequencing across the T-DNA-gene junction (Additional file 1: Figure S1). For fln1-1 and fln2-2 only one insertion was detected. PCRs with fln2-1T-DNA primers generated a product with either gene-specific primer, suggesting that this allele has two inverted T-DNA insertions (Additional file 1: Figure S1).. To determine if fln1 and fln2 T-DNA insertion lines synthesize authentic mRNA, RNA was extracted from pooled pale/chlorotic seedlings and used for subsequent RT-PCR experiments (Figure 1B). Using primers specific to FLN1, no product was detectable from fln1-1 cDNA, whereas a product was visible from Col-0 cDNA (Figure 1B,left panel). Similarly, a product was generated with FLN2-specific primers only from Col-0, not from cDNA synthesized from fln2-1 or fln2-2 RNA (Figure 1B, right panel). A visible PCR product in all samples using UBQ10 primers indicated the presence of roughly equivalent input of cDNA template. No product was made when reverse-transcriptase (RT) was omitted from the cDNA synthesis reaction (-RT lanes) indicating that cDNA, not genomic DNA, was the source of template in+RT reactions. These results indicate that the one FLN1 and the two FLN2 insertion lines are all likely to be null alleles.. Because the phenotypes originally observed resulted from seedling growth on media supplemented with B-vitamins and 1% sucrose, we sought to test whether the same pale/chlorotic phenotype recapitulated in seedlings grown on soil and to examine if the mutants could grow and develop autotrophically. Seeds from FLN/fln parents were sown directly on soil and grown under continuous light (116 mumol/sec-1m-2). The similar phenotypes observed on GM media were also observed in seedlings grown on soil (Figure 1C). fln1-1 seedlings have small yellow cotyledons that never green, they do not produce true leaves and die within two weeks after germination. fln2 mutants grow similarly on soil and on GM plates. They have pale green cotyledons with the cotyledons of fln2-2 slightly larger than those of fln2-1 (Figure 1C). The rosettes of the fln2 alleles are smaller than wild-type, and true leaves slowly green (Figure 1D). fln2-2 plants have slightly larger rosettes and are greener than fln2-1, likely due to the mixed ecotype background of fln2-2. Eventually, all fln2 mutants bolt and make seeds. Adult fln2-1 plants have fewer inflorescences than do their wild-type siblings, with chlorotic stems, cauline leaves and sepals (Figure 1E). fln2-2 plants, on the other hand, produce a taller inflorescence compared to fln2-1.. . . Inducible expression of FLN1-HA complements fln1-1. The similar phenotypes from the two independent insertion alleles of FLN2 strongly indicate that the mutant phenotype results from loss of FLN2 expression. However, only one insertion allele of FLN1 is available. To demonstrate that absence of FLN1 is responsible for the observed phenotype, FLN1/fln1-1 plants were transformed with expression constructs for constitutive expression of an HA-tagged form of FLN1. All of these transformants exhibited phenotypes consistent with transgene silencing (data not shown), preventing analysis of complementation. To overcome this problem, FLN1/fln1-1 plants were transformed with a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible [26,27] version of the same FLN1-HA open reading frame. Progeny from three independent FLN1/fln1-1 FLN1-HA lines were assessed for phenotypic changes and FLN1-HA induction after growth on DEX-containing media (Figure 2 and Table 1). For all three lines, two anti-HA immunoreactive species could be detected in extracts from seedlings grown on DEX-containing media (Figure 2B, lanes 4, 8, 12), but not in seedlings from the same lines grown on solvent control (Figure 2B, lanes 3, 7, 11) despite loading similar amounts of total protein (Figure 2B, lower panels). This indicates that FLN1-HA expression is DEX-dependent. No anti-HA immunoreactivity could be detected in protein extracts from wild-type, non-transformed control seedlings (green progeny of FLN1/fln1-1 only) grown either on solvent control (Figure 2B, lanes 1, 5, 9) or on 30 muM DEX (Figure 2B, lanes 2, 6, 10) demonstrating that the protein induced by DEX in the FLN1/fln1-1 FLN1-HA lines requires the FLN1-HA transgene rather than DEX treatment alone. We presume the 55kDa species (double-cross, Figure 2B) to be full-length FLN1-HA prior to import into the chloroplast, and the faster migrating species (single-cross, Figure 2B) to be FLN1-HA after import and transit peptide cleavage.. .

Plates shown are one representative experiment of at least three independent experiments. (B) FLN1-HA induction by dexamethasone in FLN1/fln1-1 FLN1-HA lines.

Ponceau S stained (PS) membrane is shown as a loading control. Wild-type (wt) plants were green seedlings from a FLN1/fln1-1 parent without the FLN1-HA transgene. Seedlings processed for the 0 treatment for these complementation lines were green siblings (mixed genotype) that segregated with the fln1-1 phenotype in the absence of DEX. Seedlings for other treatments consisted of a pool of all seedlings (all possible genotypes) on the plate (as fln1-1 phenotype was complemented on DEX). The presumed FLN1-HA precursor band is denoted by a double-cross, and the mature, processed FLN-HA by a single-cross. Size markers, in kDa, are to the left of blots.

Complementation of the fln1-1 phenotype by FLN1-HA was assessed by observing the segregation ratio of green to white seedlings in progeny from FLN1/fln1-1 FLN1-HA parents after germination on DEX media. In FLN1/fln1-1 progeny lacking the FLN1-HA transgene, DEX treatment did not change the 3:1 segregation ratio of green to white seedlings, nor affect the phenotype (Figure 2A, Table 1). However, growth on DEX media abolished segregation of any observable fln1-1 seedlings in selfed progeny from the three independent FLN1/fln1-1 FLN1-HA parents. This result, combined with the tight induction of FLN1-HA by DEX in these same lines (Figure 2B), demonstrates that fln1-1 can be rescued by DEX-induced expression of FLN1-HA. These lines exhibited complementation on different concentrations of DEX ranging from 0.03 to 30 muM. Lines 1 and 2 fully complement the fln1-1 phenotype when grown on 0.03 and 0.3 muM DEX, respectively, although line 2 seedlings are smaller (Figure 2A, Table 1). Line 3 partially complements this phenotype when grown on both 3.0 and 30 muM DEX. No white fln1-1 seedlings were observed either concentration, but several seedlings exhibiting white-green variegated cotyledons were observed at the highest DEX dose used (Figure 2A, Table 1).. The ability of FLN1-HA to rescue the mutant phenotype at various times after germination was investigated to assess how early FLN1 expression is required for wild type growth. Seeds from FLN1/fln1-1 FLN1-HA lines were plated, stratified for 2days at 4C and then grown at room temperature (RT). DEX was added to the plates when first moved to RT (0day), or 1, 2 or 3days later. The number of pale seedlings was scored after 7days (Figure 3). DEX addition immediately after stratification (0day) and after 1day rescued the mutant phenotype, as no or only a few pale seedlings were observed (Figure 3A, Table 2). However, DEX addition after 2 or 3days of growth failed to rescue all three lines because pale seedlings were observed at the expected ratio (Figure 3A, Table 2).. . Figure 3. .

To determine the developmental stage at which FLN1-HA expression is able to restore fln1 seedlings to wild type, the development of the seedlings was noted immediately prior to DEX addition (Figure 3B). After 1day, radicle emergence was observed, but cotyledon expansion had not yet occurred and identification of fln seedlings was not possible (Figure 3B, top). After 2days, wild-type cotyledons were reflexed, fully green and almost completely expanded, and the pale fln cotyledons were evident (Figure 3B, middle). These results indicate that FLN1-HA expression must occur very early in seedling development in order to rescue the mutant phenotype.. . . Loss of fln1 or fln2 specifically disrupts PEP-dependent transcription. To explore the role of each FLN in chloroplast transcription, chloroplast-encoded mRNA levels were determined in fln1-1 and fln2-1. Previously, the effect of reduced FLN expression by inducible RNA-interference was investigated in Arabidopsis and tobacco leaves [15], but had not been determined in stable fln null plants. Here, we examined levels of mRNA in our fln null alleles for the three classes of chloroplast-encoded genes: PEP-dependent (Class I, Figure 4A), NEP-dependent (Class III, Figure 4B), both PEP- and NEP- transcribed C(Class II, Figure 4) and for nuclear genes encoding plastid-localized proteins (Figure 4D). RNA from 7-day old fln seedlings and their phenotypic wild-type siblings (a combination of FLN and FLN/fln genotypes) were subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (Figure 4).. . Figure 4. .  Expression of chloroplast encoded genes inflnseedlings. qRT-PCR analysis of the indicated gene transcript levels was performed in 7-day-old seedlings grown as in Figure 1B. Four classes of genes were examined, PEP-dependent (A), NEP-dependent (B) PEP- and NEP-transcribed (C), and nuclear-encoded (D). Data shown are the meanstandard error of the mean (SE) of a representative experiment (n=3). Expression levels are presented as the percentage relative to wild type.. . . . Expression of PEP-dependent genes rbcL, psbA, psbB, and rrn23S was strongly reduced in both fln1-1 and fln2-1 seedlings compared to Col-0 and to their respective phenotypically wild-type siblings (Figure 4A). Transcripts for NEP-dependent genes rpoB, accD, and rpoC1, on the other hand, were slightly elevated in fln seedlings, except for rpl23 transcripts with only 50% of wild type expression in the mutants. clpP, atpB, and ndhB are transcribed by both PEP and NEP. Both clpP and ndhB mRNAs were slightly up-regulated in the mutants, while atpB mRNA was similar in both fln mutants to their respective wild type siblings (Figure 4C).. Expectedly, mRNAs for FLN1 and FLN2 were absent in cDNA prepared from their respective mutants. Interestingly, FLN2 mRNA is two-fold higher in fln1-1 than Col-0, but the opposite is not true, FLN1 mRNA is not elevated in fln2-1 (Figure 4D). For other nuclear-encoded chloroplast-localized proteins, fln and wild-type siblings had similar transcript levels, approximately a 50% reduction compared to Col-0 (Figure 4D). This reduction likely results from the mixed genotypes of the phenotypically wild type sibling seedlings consisting of FLN/FLN and FLN/fln1-1 genotypes. In summary, only PEP-dependent transcripts were consistently and severely down-regulated in fln seedlings, indicating that FLNs are positive regulators of TAC complex function.. . . FLN proteins are not required for plant cell elongation in the dark. Given the strong dependence on FLN expression for wild-type growth of light-grown seedlings, we sought to ascertain if FLN proteins are required for skotomorphogenesis. We examined hypocotyl elongation in dark-grown 7day-old seedlings from FLN/fln parents. All seedlings had elongated hypocotyls, an apical hook and unexpanded cotyledons (data not shown). We measured hypocotyl length of etiolated seedlings to assess if cell expansion in the dark was affected (Figure 5). fln hypocotyl lengths were not significantly shorter than those of their corresponding wild-type siblings as assessed by a Studentst-test (p-values for comparison to wild-type siblings: fln1-1, 0.607; fln2-1, 0.202; and fln2-2, 0.0821; alpha = 0.05).. . Figure 5. .  Hypocotyl length of 7day old dark-grownflnmutants. Progeny from FLN/fln parents were grown in the dark for 7days at 20o C. Measurements of fln hypocotyls are shown next to their respective phenotypically wild-type siblings and combined for two different growth experiments. No fln mutant was significantly different from wild type siblings using a StudentsT-test (alpha=0.05). Bars are se. (35 n 27).. . . . Dark-grown seedlings were then exposed to light. Cotyledons of fln1-1 mutants never greened, but did unhook in the light. fln2 seedlings unhooked and turned pale green, eventually resembling cotyledons of fln2 mutants grown under continuous light. Thus, prior expansion in the dark did not change the phenotype of fln cotyledons in the light. We therefore conclude that neither FLN1 nor FLN2 are required for skotomorphogenesis.. . . FLN proteins are required for normal plastid development. To investigate plastid development in fln1 and fln2 seedlings, we examined chloroplast ultrastructure in cotyledons of 7day-old light-grown seedlings grown on GM by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 6). Columbia (Col-0) cells contained a population of morphologically homogenous chloroplasts (Figure 6A). Wild-type chloroplasts are typified by stacks of thylakoid grana membrane connected via stromal thylakoid membranes with a few starch granules and plastoglobuli interspersed throughout the stroma (Figure 6C). Consistent with fln1 mutants having a more severe morphological phenotype (Figure 1), cells of fln1-1 were extremely vacuolated and contained chloroplasts with more extreme defects (Figure 6D, E) than those of fln2 cells (Figure 6G, J). Almost all  fln1 chloroplasts lack internal membrane structures with a large number of densely staining plastoglobuli. (Figure 6F).. . Figure 6. .  Chloroplast ultrastructure inflnmutants. Cotyledons from 7-day old seedlings were fixed and sectioned for TEM imaging. (A) to (C) Col-0, (D) to (F)fln1-1, (G) to (I)fln2-1, (J) to (L)fln2-2. Scale bars for first, second, and third columns are 10, 2, and 0.5 mum, respectively.. . . . In contrast, fln2 cells contained a population of chloroplasts with a range of defects (Figure 6G, J). In both fln2 alleles, chloroplasts have highly disrupted internal membrane structures compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figure 6H, K). The majority of fln2-1 and fln2-2 chloroplasts were missing thylakoid membranes, highly vacuolated, containing many more plastoglobuli than wild-type, and filled with unidentifiable suborganellar structures (Figure 6I). Other chloroplasts contained some stromal thylakoid membrane and a few grana stacks (Figure 6L). In summary, fln2-1 chloroplasts were either lacking any typical membrane structures or contained only a few thylakoid membranes and grana stacks. fln2-2 chloroplasts, on the other hand, had some contiguous stromal thylakoid membrane forming a reticulum with reduced granal stacks (Figure 6L).. While mature chloroplasts of fln mutants fail to develop properly and mutants have severe growth defects in the light, cell elongation in the dark is largely unaffected (Figure 5). These observations lead to us investigate whether etioplast development was affected in fln mutants. Only fln2 could be analyzed because fln1 homozygous seed cannot be obtained [fln1-1 is seedling lethal (Figure 1)], and fln1-1 segregants cannot be phenotypically distinguished from FLN1 and FLN1/fln1-1 siblings in the dark (Figure 5). fln 2-1 etioplasts were examined from cotyledons of 3-day old dark-grown seedlings by TEM (Figure 7). For both Col-0 and fln2-1 dark-grown cells, the cytoplasm was dense with multiple small vacuoles and oil bodies (Figure 7A, D). fln2-1 cells also contained subcellular components that did not fix during the preparation of the samples, leaving holes in the sections (Figure 7E). Etioplasts in Col-0 could easily be identified and stained densely (Figure 7B), but fln2-1 etioplasts stained less densely and were difficult to discern from other cellular contents (Figure 7E). Col-0 etioplasts contained obvious prolamellar bodies with stromal strands of thylakoid membrane extending from them, as classically observed (Figure 7C). fln2-1 etioplasts did contain prolamellar bodies, but were atypical and lacked any obvious associated stromal thylakoids (Figure 7f). Altogether, these data indicate that FLN2 is not only required for chloroplast development in the light, but also for development of etioplasts in the dark.. . Figure 7. .

Scale bars for first, second, and third columns are 10, 2, and 0.5 mum, respectively.. . . . . . FLNs function additively in plant growth and development. To determine the effect on seedling growth when both FLN proteins are absent, we crossed fln2-1 homozygotes to FLN1/fln1-1 heterozygotes to obtain fln1 fln2 double homozygous mutants. Seeds from FLN1/fln1-1 FLN2/fln2-1 plants were plated and growth monitored over a three-week period. One week-old pale/chlorotic seedlings were marked and photographed (Figure 8A, B). The same plate was incubated for two additional weeks, after which these plants were sacrificed for fln1-1 and fln2-1 genotyping. Double fln1 fln2 mutants were identified (circled, Figure 8A, B), and recovered with the expected 1/16 frequency in a large F2 population (chi2=1.142, p-value=0.2853, alpha = 0.05).. . Figure 8. .  fln1 fln2double mutant analysis. F2 progeny from FLN1/fln1-1 FLN2/fln2-1 parents are shown. (A) and (B) F2 seeds were plated on GM and grown for three weeks with images taken at 1week (A), 2weeks, and 3weeks (B). Pale and white seedlings were sacrificed for genotyping. Individuals identified as fln1 fln2 are circled. One individual accidentally moved on the plate during the growth period and is denoted with a star. (C) Left, middle and right sets of pictures, magnification of seedlings from the plate shown in (A), after 2weeks growth, and from the plate in (B), respectively. Three representative seedlings are shown for each indicated genotype, with their phenotypes shown at different ages.. . . . Also among the one week-old pale seedlings were single mutant siblings and siblings heterozygous at one locus and homozygous at the other (Figure 8C). Three different seedlings of each genotype, representative of the phenotypes observed, are shown at different ages. Single fln2-1 seedlings have pale cotyledons, and a few green true leaves by three weeks of growth; unlike on soil, other leaves remain pale (Figure 8C, first row). As observed on soil (Figure 1), single mutant fln1-1 cotyledons are white and totally void of visible chlorophyll. Unlike on soil, fln1-1 seedlings grown on media supplemented with 1% sucrose produce true leaves. These leaves are white and never green (Figure 8C, second row).. Analysis of FLN1/fln1-1 fln2-1 and fln1-1 FLN2/fln2-2 plants revealed haplo-insufficiency for FLN function in these genotypes. FLN1/fln1-1 fln2-1 seedlings are more similar in appearance to the more severe single fln1-1 rather than to single fln2-1 after one week of growth, and the cotyledons never green. True leaves for this genotypic class emerge pale green, but are less expanded than those of fln2-1. By three weeks, some FLN1/fln1-1 fln2-1 plants resemble fln2-1, while the majority has a more severe phenotype (Figure 8C, third row). fln1-1 FLN2/fln2-1 seedlings appear like fln1-1 after seven days of growth, but by 14days a fraction of this genotypic class begins to have shriveled cotyledons, while others continued to look like fln1-1 (Figure 8C, fourth row). Even after three weeks, the more severe individuals never expand their true leaves, and resemble the fln1-1 fln2-1 double mutant (Figure 8C, bottom row).. Double mutant fln1-1 fln2-1 plants are indistinguishable from their fln1-1 siblings after 7days of growth, but are clearly different after three weeks (Figure 8c, fifth row). All double mutants produce one set of very small, white true leaves visible by two weeks, but these never expand. The double mutant and a subset of fln1-1 FLN2/fln2-1 seedlings cannot be distinguished from each other phenotypically, and together demonstrate that seedlings lacking all or with insufficient FLN activity are seedling lethal even when supplemented with sucrose. This result suggests that FLN function, in some capacity, is required for development even when sucrose is present. This genetic analysis also suggests that FLN1 and FLN2 probably do not have functionally specificity, but rather work additively to regulate gene expression..
PMC4691322	Results. . Isopentenyltransferases contribute to branching in intact Arabidopsis plants. Isopentenyltransferases (IPTs) catalyse an early step in CK biosynthesis, encoded by nine genes in Arabidopsis (Kakimoto, 2001; Takei etal., 2001a). IPT1 and IPT3-IPT8 are ATP/ADP IPTs and contribute to iP- and tZ-type CK synthesis (Miyawaki etal., 2006). As iP- and tZ-type CKs comprise the major CKs in Arabidopsis, these IPT genes were chosen for further investigation. IPT4,IPT6 and IPT8 are predominantly expressed in floral tissues, and are therefore unlikely to contribute to bud activation (Takei etal., 2001a; Miyawaki etal., 2004). The remaining four genes, IPT1 (At1g68460), IPT3 (At3g63110), IPT5 (At5g19040) and IPT7 (At3g23630), are expressed in roots and vegetative shoot tissues, and could be involved in shoot branching.. In pea, CK is proposed to act as a second messenger for auxin because auxin in the PATS represses expression of PsIPT1 and PsIPT2, whilst decapitation reduces stem auxin levels, resulting in increased IPT expression and levels of iP- and tZ-type CK in the stem (Tanaka etal., 2006). To test whether Arabidopsis IPT genes are similarly responsive to decapitation, the four selected IPT genes were assayed using an isolated two-node system (Ongaro etal., 2008; Prusinkiewicz etal., 2009). Two-node stem segments bearing the intact apex and inactive buds were collected and left for several days to allow the stem to elongate (Prusinkiewicz etal., 2009). The buds on these isolated segments grow out as normal if the apex is removed (FigureS1). Stem tissues were harvested 0 and 6h after decapitation and expression levels of IPT1,IPT3,IPT5 and IPT7 determined relative to the reference gene UBC21 using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Figure1a). Decapitation resulted in an eight-fold increase in IPT3 compared with intact controls (P0.01), while the remaining IPT transcripts were not significantly affected.. . Figure 1. .

For (b), (d) and (e) statistical comparisons were made between the wild type and each mutant using Mann-Whitney tests with a Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons; asterisks (**) denote a significance level of P<0.0083 in (b) and (d), or P<0.0167 in (e).. . . . Next, the effect of IPT loss-of-function on branching was investigated. Rosette branches were counted at maturity in single and higher-order mutant combinations of the four IPT genes (Miyawaki etal., 2006) (Figure1b). Single mutants showed significant reductions in branching: ipt1,ipt3,ipt5 and ipt7 all formed less than one branch on average (P<0.008 for all genotypes compared with the wild type). The ipt3,5,7 mutant (Figure1c) formed a similarly low number of branches and ipt1,3,5,7 formed no branches. This is consistent with the well-established role for CK in promoting branching.. We used grafting to test whether the IPT genes are required in the root or shoot to promote branching in intact plants. As ipt1,3,5,7 is severely stunted, reciprocal grafts were performed between the ipt3,5,7 triple mutant and the wild type. At maturity, self-grafted ipt3,5,7 mutants possessed reduced branching compared to wild-type controls (P0.01), and the presence of either a wild-type root or shoot reciprocally grafted to ipt3,5,7 was sufficient to confer wild-type levels of branching (Figure1e). Cytokinins produced in roots can therefore compensate for reduced CK synthesis in ipt3,5,7 shoots, suggesting that CKs produced in the whole plant, rather than CKs produced in the shoot alone, contribute to branching in intact plants.. We next tested whether these IPT genes are required for auxin-mediated apical dominance by analysing the decapitation response of the ipt mutants. In particular, ipt3 might have reduced branching as IPT3 expression is responsive to decapitation (Figure1a), and IPT expression in the stem correlates with CK levels and bud outgrowth in pea (Tanaka etal., 2006). Mature plants were decapitated at the base of the bolt and rosette branch numbers were counted after 1week (Figure1d). Surprisingly, most of the mutants, including ipt3, responded as the wild type, producing between 6.4 and 7.3 rosette branches. The exceptions to this were ipt3,5,7 (2.40.3 branches, P<0.008), and ipt1,3,5,7 (0.30.1, P<0.008).. Inspection of ipt3,5,7 and ipt1,3,5,7 showed that many of the axils lacked visible axillary buds, suggesting a failure in bud initiation, which would clearly preclude bud activation. We chose ipt3,5,7 and the three cognate single mutants to quantify this axil phenotype in more detail. All genotypes were found to have some empty axils in more basal rosette nodes (Figure2a-e) when examined by eye. There was some evidence of an increased number of empty axils in ipt3 (Figure2a,b), which had 20.3% empty axils compared with 11.5% in the wild type (P<0.001) (Figure2f). Both ipt5 (Figure2c) and ipt7 (Figure2d) had similar numbers of empty axils to the wild type. In ipt3,5,7 the majority of rosette axils bore no visible bud (69.6%, P<0.001 compared with the wild type) (Figure2a,e). The reduction in decapitation-induced branching observed in ipt3,5,7 (and ipt1,3,5,7) (Figure1c) is therefore probably due to compromised bud development. Consistent with this, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed frequently empty axils in ipt3,5,7 (Figure2g).. . Figure 2. . ipt3,5,7 possesses fewer buds in its axils.Nodes with (dark green) or without (light green) a visible bud in (a) wild-type, (b) ipt3, (c) ipt5, (d) ipt7 and (e) ipt3,5,7 mutants (white represents no node).

Scanning electron micrograph of (g) wild-type and (h) ipt3,5,7 nodes.. . . . Taken together, the ipt mutant analysis suggests that CKsynthesis is required to allow high levels of branching in intact plants but not for activation of buds following decapitation. To confirm that ipt3,5,7 buds are capable of responding to apical auxin, we investigated the response of ipt3,5,7 buds to apical 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) in an isolated nodal assay (Chatfield etal., 2000). The outgrowth of wild-type buds was delayed by apical auxin application as expected, and no significant differences were found between ipt3,5,7 and the wild type over time in either treatment (Figure3). Together, these data suggest that ipt3,5,7 buds can grow with wild-type kinetics and are auxin responsive, and therefore their reduced branching following decapitation (Figure1c) is likely to be due to defects in bud initiation.. . Figure 3. . ipt3,5,7 buds are responsive to apical auxin.Isolated nodal segments bearing one bud were treated apically for 4days with 1mumNAA or mock treatment. The mean bud lengthSE is shown (n=7-31). No statistically significant differences were found between genotypes over time in NAA treatments or mock treatments. Statistical comparisons were carried out using t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests.. . . . These results suggest that the main role of CK in Arabidopsis branching is to allow the activation of buds in the presence of high auxin, thereby escaping apical dominance. Reduced CK synthesis, as in the ipt mutants, does not increase the sensitivity of buds to apical auxin, and high IPT activity is not required to activate buds following decapitation. These results are consistent with previous observations that CKs have relatively little effect on the outgrowth of isolated buds, but they can overcome the suppressive effect of apical auxin (Chatfield etal., 2000).. . . Identification of auxin- and CK-responsive genes in buds. To investigate the effect of CK on buds inhibited by apical auxin, we compared the transcriptomes of mock-treated buds with those supplied with apical auxin alone or apical auxin combined with basal CK (6-benzylaminopurine, BA) in isolated nodes using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis gene chip ATH1. Buds were harvested after 18 h, allowing sufficient time for transcriptional changes to occur but before major size differences become apparent.. Comparison of the two treatments that activate buds, mock versus simultaneous auxin plus CK, revealed only two genes with statistically significant differences in expression: At1g75450, encoding a cytokinin oxidase (CKX5) (Schmlling etal., 2003; Werner etal., 2003), and At2g33830, a bud dormancy-associated gene (DRM2) (Tatematsu etal., 2005). Both genes were more highly expressed in buds treated with auxin plus CK than mock-treated buds.. To identify genes associated with bud activation, we focused on transcripts that were statistically significantly two-fold or more downregulated by apical auxin compared to mock-treated, but two-fold or more upregulated by simultaneous supply of basal CK compared to auxin alone. The number of genes meeting these criteria was 220 (Data S1). To select genes that might be particularly relevant for CK-mediated bud activation, we ranked them according to their upregulation in auxin plus CK compared with auxin alone. This produces a list in which the top 12 genes are upregulated five-fold or more (Table1). Of these 12, 11 have at least one ARR1 response element (AAGATT) within 2000bp upstream of their start codon, consistent with their CK responsiveness (Sakai etal., 2000, 2001; Taniguchi etal., 2007). Included in the 12 are CKX5 and five members of a six-gene clade of type-A ARRs. The type-A ARRs are primary CK response genes, and are generally considered to be involved in feedback downregulation of CK signalling (Brandstatter and Kieber, 1998; Imamura etal., 1998; DAgostino etal., 2000; To etal., 2004, 2007). This type-A ARR clade, comprising ARR3 (At1g59940), ARR4 (At1g10470), ARR5 (At3g48100), ARR6 (At5g62920), ARR7 (At1g19050) and ARR15 (At1g74890), was selected for further analysis of CK-mediated bud activation.. . Table 1. . The top 12 transcripts downregulated by apical auxin and upregulated by auxin and cytokinin (CK).

We first verified the expression profile of the five ARR genes using qPCR. All genes were upregulated 2.5- to 11-fold in buds treated with basal CK and apical auxin compared with apical auxin alone (FigureS2).. To investigate the role of this type-A ARR clade in bud activation, the hextuple arr3,4,5,6,7,15 mutant branching phenotype was examined in mature plants left intact (Figure4a) or decapitated (Figure4b). Similar to ipt mutants, intact arr3,4,5,6,7,15 plants formed significantly fewer rosette branches than the wild type (2.50.1 versus 3.90.1, respectively, P0.001) but there was no significant difference in decapitation-induced branching.. . Figure 4. . arr3,4,5,6,7,15 has reduced branching in intact plants but a normal decapitation response.Rosette branches 0.5cm were counted in (a) intact and (b) decapitated plants at maturity. The meanSE is shown (n=25-72). Statistical comparisons shown were made between the wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,7,15 using the Mann-Whitney test. Asterisks denote a significance level of P<0.001 (***).(c) Intact wild-type (left) and arr3,4,5,6,7,15 (right) plants at 5weeks.. . . . We used the isolated one-node assay to assess the CK response of arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds. Mock-treated mutant buds activated with normal kinetics and were inhibited by apical auxin, as for the wild type (Figure5). However, the ability of CK to overcome inhibition by apical auxin was compromised in arr3,4,5,6,7,15. Over time, there was no significant difference in length between mutant buds treated with apical auxin and those treated with apical auxin and basal CK, whereas wild-type buds treated with apical auxin and basal CK were significantly longer (P<0.01) than their apical-auxin-only equivalents from 48h onward (Figure5b).. . Figure 5. . arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds have impaired outgrowth to CK but retain normal gene expression responses.(a) Wild-type and (b) arr3,4,5,6,7,15 isolated nodal segments bearing one bud were treated for 8days with mock, 1mum NAA (apically), 1mum 6-benzylaminopurine (BA; basally) or combined 1mum NAA (apically) and 1mum BA (basally). The meanSE is shown (n=20). Statistical comparisons shown were made between NAA and NAA+BA treated buds using t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests as the data did not always follow a normal distribution. Asterisks denote a significance level of P<0.05 (*), P<0.01 (**) or P<0.001 (***); N.S, not significant.(c) Expression of cytokinin-responsive genes in isolated buds treated with NAA and BA as in (a) and (b). MeanSE of two or three pools of 20 buds each is shown.. . . . To determine whether transcriptional responses to CK are impaired in arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds, we used several genes from Table1 as markers and analysed their expression in wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds treated with or without basal CK in the presence of apical auxin (Figure5c). Despite the fact that CK-treated wild-type buds activate while their arr3,4,5,6,7,15 equivalents do not, CK treatment resulted in the upregulation of all the CK-responsive transcripts tested in the mutant buds at least as strongly as in wild-type buds.. Together, these results suggest that this type-A ARR clade is required for CK-mediated bud activation but not for bud transcriptional responses to CK. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the conclusion from the IPT gene analysis that CK is not required for release from auxin-mediated apical dominance, but rather acts to overcome the inhibitory effects of apical auxin, promoting branching in intact plants.. . . Strigolactone does not rescue decapitation-induced bud outgrowth in CK mutants. It has previously been suggested that bud activity represents a read-out of the ratio of CK to SL in buds, with both being influenced by auxin in the main stem (Dun etal., 2012). This may explain why in many species SL is unable to inhibit buds in the absence of a competing auxin source, as high CK levels resulting from low auxin might render the buds resistant to SL. According to this hypothesis, arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds may respond normally to decapitation despite their lack of CK response because of low levels of SL. If this is the case, isolated arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds should fail to activate in the presence of high SL. We therefore tested the response of arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds to the synthetic SL GR24 (Figure6). As previously described by Crawford etal. (2010), wild-type buds activated similarly with or without basal SL, and SL applied in combination with apical auxin inhibited buds to a greater extent than auxin alone (P0.01). arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds responded similarly to the wild type. There was a slight reduction in SL-treated arr3,4,5,6,7,15 bud elongation relative to mock, but this was not statistically significant. Additionally, arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds exhibited some resistance to SL, as there was no effect of SL on bud activation in the presence of apical auxin. The finding that wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,7,15 buds alike activate under high SL suggests that depletion of auxin in the main stem alone is sufficient to trigger sustained bud activity, with no requirement for low SL and/or high CK, consistent with the canalisation-based hypothesis for bud activation.. . Figure 6. . Strigolactone does not inhibit arr3,4,5,6,7,15 bud outgrowth.(a) Wild-type and (b) arr3,4,5,6,7,15 isolated nodal segments bearing one bud were treated with mock, 0.5mum NAA (apically), 5mum GR24 (basally) or combined 0.5mum NAA and 5mum GR24 (basally). The meanSE on day 6 is shown (n=20). Statistical comparisons shown were made using t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests as the data did not always follow a normal. Asterisks denote a significance level of P<0.01 (**); N.S., not significant.. . . . . . Branching response to high nitrate is impaired in higher-order CK mutants. Our data support the hypothesis that the main role of CK in branching is to drive bud activation in the presence of high auxin. One situation where this might be physiologically relevant is during changes in nitrate availability. Low nitrate availability is known to increase in the proportion of biomass allocated to roots versus shoots (Drew, 1975; Scheible etal., 1997) and high N is associated with bud activation (McIntyre and Hunter, 1975; McIntyre and Cessna, 1991; Ding etal., 1995; McIntyre, 2001; Liu etal., 2011; de Jong etal., 2014). As nitrate is known to promote CK synthesis (Takei etal., 2001b, 2002, 2004), CK might drive the activation of additional shoot branches despite the high main stem auxin contributed by already active shoots. To test this, we compared total branch numbers of CK mutants with the wild-type under high- and low-nitrate conditions (Figure7). Although ipt3 and ipt5 single mutants have similar branching levels to the wild type when grown under these conditions, the ipt3,5,7 and arr3,4,5,6,7,15 mutants have significantly fewer active branches than the wild type on high nitrate. In contrast, there was no difference between the wild type and the mutants on low nitrate. These data suggest that CK is not required to support branching on low nitrate but that it may be important to enhance branching under high nitrate.. . Figure 7. . The branching plasticity response to high N is reduced in higher-order cytokinin mutants.Plants were grown on soil-free medium under high (9mm NO3) or low (1.8mm NO3) nitrate conditions and the total number of active rosette and cauline branches (1cm) counted at the onset of senescence. The meanSE is shown (n=11-12). The statistical comparisons shown were made between the wild type and each mutant on high nitrate using Mann-Whitney tests with a Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons; asterisks denote a significance level of P<0.0125 (**). No significant differences were found between the wild type-and ipt3 or ipt5 on high nitrate or between the wild type and any mutants on low nitrate..
PMC2999534	Results. . 1. Kinome profiling of MeJA and SA treated plants using PepChip arrays. To obtain the kinome fingerprint of plants treated with defense related hormones, Arabidopsis accession Columbia-0 (Col-0) seedlings were incubated for 1 h and 6 h with MeJA, SA or a combination of the two (SA/MeJA). Specificity of MeJA and SA responses was confirmed 6 h post-incubation by quantification of transcript accumulation of the inducible marker genes PDF1.2 (MeJA) and PR1 (SA), by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). As expected, PR1 expression was up regulated by SA and SA/MeJA, whereas PDF1.2 expression was up regulated by MeJA and down regulated in the SA/MeJA combination treatment, compared to JA-treatment alone [3], [9], [42], [43].. A total of twelve PepChips containing 1178 consensus peptides (in duplicate) were incubated with extracts obtained from three independently grown biological replicates treated for one hour with either control solution, MeJA, SA, or SA/MeJA (Dataset S1). Several peptides showed differences in intensity between treatments, indicating differential phosphorylation (Figure S1). The majority of phosphorylated peptides was phosphorylated to similar levels in all treatments, and supposedly represent general peptides that detect kinase activities involved in basic cellular functioning [29].. Compared to control treatment, we identified 75 significantly differentially phosphorylated peptides upon MeJA treatment, 63 upon SA treatment and 123 upon the combination treatment (for a complete list see Table S1). Surprisingly, many spots were uniquely differentially phosphorylated by either SA, MeJA, or SA/MeJA, and relatively little overlap was found (Figure 1). This indicates that signaling following SA/MeJA treatment is not simply the sum of the signaling that occurs after SA and MeJA single treatments.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.g001. Figure 1. . Venn diagram of differentially phosphorylated substrates upon treatment (MeJA, SA or SA/MeJA) versus control (C).. The individual differentially phosphorylated peptides are shown in Table S1; peptides that are differentially phosphorylated after two or more treatments are represented in the table in subsequent rows. Of the nine (8+1) spots, differentially phosphorylated by both MeJA and SA, all were changed in the same direction, this was also observed for those that were differentially phosphorylated by SA/MeJA and overlap with SA or MeJA.. . . . . . 2. General description of differentially phosphorylated peptides by plant defense hormones. The PepChip analysis showed that 37 substrate residues annotated to detect Tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation were differentially phosphorylated; generally the phosphorylation-level is increased upon each of the treatments (Table SI). Although tyrosine phosphorylation in plants is debated in general, and tyrosine receptors are controversial, examples of tyrosine phosphorylation are present (Text S1). Also Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity in plants is controversial. The artificial substrate Kemptide (RRASLG) is generally used to monitor PKA activity in animal tissues and is shown to be a substrate of Arabidopsis AGC-kinase 2 [44]. Several Kemptide analogues showed increased phosphorylation after the treatments (12 out of 15; Table SI). Two exceptions were the more divergent peptides RRAASVA and RRASS, which had decreased phosphorylation. Other differentially phosphorylated targets of PKA and PKC, together belonging to the AGC-kinases, were generally increased (20 out of 27; Table SI). Substrates of the Casein Kinase II (CKII) showed generally decreased phosphorylation after different treatments (13 out of 15).. Cell Division Cycle 2 (CDC2) is represented on the PepChip by the peptide GEGTYGVVY, which is identical in the Arabidopsis CDC2 orthologue (At3g48750). On this peptide consensus motifs for the inhibitory kinases WEE and MYT (also found in Arabidopsis) are present [45], [46]. MeJA treatment increased phosphorylation of the peptide, which suggests inhibition of CDC2 activity. On the other hand, several CDC2 target substrates were higher phosphorylated after SA and SA/MeJA treatment. One CDC2-annotated peptide was also higher phosphorylated after JA, but another showed lower phosphorylation upon MeJA treatment.. Two substrate peptides present in Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH; DPGTSYRTR and YSGHSMSDP) had increased phosphorylation after MeJA treatment (one also after SA/MeJA) indicating activation of PDH-kinase. Both peptides are highly similar to peptide sequences in the orthologous Arabidopsis PDHs (At1g24180 and At1g59900). For a more elaborate presentation of differentially phosphorylated peptides, see Text S1.. . . 3. Kinome and transcriptome analysis reveals regulation of plant specific processes by jasmonate. Ten PepChip peptide substrates are derived from plant-specific proteins (Table 1). None of the plant-specific peptides showed significantly differential phosphorylation after SA treatment. However, four were differentially phosphorylated after MeJA treatment: an aquaporin water channel derived peptide, a Phosphoenol Pyruvate Carboxylase (PEP carboxylase) derived peptide, a Photosystem II D protein (PSII D) derived peptide and the photoreceptor phytochrome A (PhyA) derived peptide (Table 1). Additionally, peptides of PhyA, PSII D and a Sucrose Synthase showed enhanced phosphorylation after combined SA/MeJA treatment (Table 1). This indicates that the proteins from which these peptides are derived are post-translational regulated during MeJA and SA/MeJA signaling.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.t001. Table 1. .

Significant differences in phosphorylation (p<0.05) compared to control (C) were determined using a Student's t-Test on three replicates of plants grown at different moments in time.. . . . The MeJA control of photosynthesis and light-related factors as suggested by kinomics is supported by transcriptomics data. Re-evaluation of previously published microarray data [1], [47] by MapMan analysis revealed that the significantly (p<0.05) altered bins in plants incubated for 1 h with MeJA, were stress, signaling and photosynthesis (PS; Table 2). After 3 h and 6 h incubation several other bins became significantly altered. PS and stress were the only ones that remained significantly different at all tested time points. The PS bin contains three sub-bins (Table S2). At all time points the light reaction bin (1.1) was significantly different. Within this sub-bin, PSII (bin 1.1.1) was consistently significantly down regulated after MeJA treatment. In addition, light signaling (bin 30.11, harboring among others the phytochrome photoreceptors) was also significantly down regulated after 3 h (p=1.15E-2) and 6 h (p=1.01E-3) of MeJA treatment. Genes involved in SA, ET and JA metabolism are grouped in bin 17 (hormone metabolism) which was significantly different at 3 h and 6 h after MeJA treatment (Table S3). As expected, MeJA induced several JA biosynthetic genes [48] (e.g. LOX2, data not shown).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.t002. Table 2. .

It seems that this occurs at both the transcriptional and posttranslational level. Together, these results predict interaction between the JA pathway and light signaling, which is in accordance with recently published data [25].. . . 4. Jasmonate controls low light-induced differential hyponastic petiole growth. To confirm the predicted interaction between JA and SA/MeJA signaling and light signaling, we tested interference of MeJA with low light intensity-induced upward leaf movement (hyponastic growth), as this response is controlled by both PhyA and photosynthesis-related signals [40], [41], [49].. First, we assessed if MeJA had an effect on petiole angles under standard light conditions (200 mol m-2 s-1). Vegetative Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were soil drenched with 100 M MeJA or mock (control) solution 1 h prior to the start of observation. Kinetics of petiole movement was subsequently monitored during the next 24 h using a time-lapse camera-setup [40], [50]. In control conditions, petiole angles slightly decreased over time due to aging and diurnal effects [40]. This decrease was enhanced by MeJA (Figure 2A; Figure 3).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.g002. Figure 2. . MeJA effects on light controlled leaf movements.. (A-F) effect of (1 h) pre-treatment with 100 M MeJA (closed circles), compared to mock (open circles), or (G-I) infestation with Pieris rapae (closed triangles) caterpillars compared to control (open triangles), on Arabidopsis petiole angles. Plants were (A,F) in standard light (200 mol m-2 s-1) or (B-E,G-I): treated with low light (200 mol m-2 s-1 to 15 mol m-2 s-1).

Note that the Y-axis in panel (A) is different from the other panels (b-i) as here the angle relative to the horizontal is depicted, as opposed to (B-I) which shows pair-wise subtracted values per time point for the corresponding response in control conditions. Error bars represent SE, n>12 petioles.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.g003. Figure 3. . Typical effects of MeJA on leaf movement.. Hyponastic growth phenotype of Arabidopsis Col-0 in control conditions or after 10 h low light (LL; 200 mol m-2 s-1 to 20 mol m-2 s-1) treatment in the presence of MeJA, or a mock solution. Note that the petiole-lamina border was painted to facilitate time-lapse measurement of leaf angle kinetics.. . . . Hyponastic growth, as induced by low light-intensity (reduction of the photosynthetic active radiation from 200- to 15 mol m-2 s-1), was repressed by MeJA in both Col-0 and Landsberg erecta (Ler) (Figure 2B, C; Figure 3). Initially, leaf inclination keeps track of non-MeJA treated plants, but after 8 h, the MeJA-treated plants reached equilibrium, whereas petiole angles in non-MeJA treated plants steadily increased. As expected, MeJA did not affect low light-induced hyponastic growth in the JA-insensitive coronatine insensitive1-1 receptor mutant (coi1-1 in Col-5) [51] (Figure 2D). This confirms that JA signaling is involved in the repression of low light-induced hyponastic growth. MeJA did also not influence hyponastic growth induced by low light in the phya mutant background (in Ler; Figure 2E), indicating the involvement of PhyA in the interference of JA signaling with this response.. To investigate the involvement of photosynthesis signaling in the observed phenomenon, we repressed photosynthetic electron transport by 3-(3,4-dichlorphenyl)-1, 1-dimethylurea (DCMU). This results in a hyponastic growth phenotype under standard light conditions and is indicative for the involvement of photosynthesis-related signals in the control of petiole angles [41]. Application of MeJA to DCMU treated plants suppressed the DCMU-induced hyponastic response (Figure 2F), indicating that MeJA interferes with signals originating from reduced photosynthesis.. Tissue chewing caterpillars such as larvae of the small cabbage white butterfly Pieris rapae, induce JA accumulation in Arabidopsis [1]. P. rapae was applied to Col-0 plants 20 h before the switch to low light. Severe damage (of each leaf 50% was eaten) was visible at the start of the low light treatment (data not shown) and was comparable in Col-0 and Col-5 plants that lack trichomes [52]. Hyponastic growth was repressed by P. rapae in a similar manner as was seen for MeJA (Figure 2B, G, H). When P. rapae infested JA-signaling deficient coi1-1 plants, the hyponastic response to low light conditions was not influenced (Figure 2I). This suggests that the reduction of hyponasty as seen after P. rapae infestation is a direct consequence of the JA response induced by the caterpillar and is not resulting from physical damage.. Together, the data on hyponastic growth support the kinome- and transctiptome-derived predictions that MeJA interferes with light-signalling.. . . 5. Salicylate suppresses hyponastic growth to low light synergistically to jasmonate. The PepChip data showed no significant changes in phosphorylation of plant-specific substrate peptides after SA treatment. However, a non-significant increase in phosphorylation of the PhyA and PSII D peptides was observed (data not shown) and the combined treatment (SA/MeJA) resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylation of both peptides (Table 1).. Application of SA to Arabidopsis plants suppressed low light-induced hyponastic growth (Figure 4A), similar to MeJA treatment. The combination SA/MeJA showed synergism, since this resulted in complete abolishment of the hyponastic growth response (Figure 4B). The SA-insensitive non-expresser of PR genes 1 (npr1-1) mutant showed a normal low-light induced hyponastic growth response in the presence of SA (Figure 4D). This indicates that the repression by SA depends on intact SA signaling routes. MeJA repressed low light-induced hyponastic growth in npr1-1 (Figure 4C). Vice versa, SA application to the JA-signaling mutant coi1-1 led to repression of low light-induced hyponastic growth (Figure 4E).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0014255.g004. Figure 4. .

Together, these data suggest that besides JA, also SA is a modulator of light intensity-dependent differential petiole growth. Furthermore, MeJA and SA appear to act additive and exert their function via at least partially different JA- and SA-specific signaling routes..
PMC3040660	Results. . cdka;1 is a tool to identify key seed regulators. Here we have used cdka;1 as a tool to identify factors sensitive to the vital parental gene balance in the endosperm. In heterozygous cdka;1 mutants, the second pollen mitosis is either missing or is severely delayed. However, mutant pollen can successfully fertilize the egg cell while leaving the central cell unfertilized [40], [41]. A detailed analysis by Aw and colleagues has revealed that a second sperm cell is delivered to the central cell, but that karyogamy does not take place [42]. Although not properly fertilized, the majority of the central cells in cdka;1 fertilized ovules (70-90%) are triggered to initiate endosperm proliferation [40], [42], [43]. Thus, fertilization by cdka;1 sperm cells creates a unique situation where endosperm initially develops without any paternal contribution (in the following also referred to as cdka;1P). The endosperm, however remains under-developed, and ultimately the seed aborts, further demonstrating the importance of the paternal contribution to the endosperm for proper seed development. Since activation of maternal alleles by loss of maternal FIS PRC2 could rescue seed lethality [43], we hypothesized that the disturbance of parental gene balance in the endosperm is the main cause leading to developmental arrest of cdka;1P at 3-4 days after pollination (DAP).. To identify factors and mechanisms sensitive to such an imbalance in gene dosage in the endosperm and with that likely key regulators of seed development, we performed microarray transcript profiling of cdka;1 fertilized seeds at 3 DAP (Figure S1A). Due to the heterozygous nature of the cdka;1 mutant line used, a transcript that is absent in cdka;1p seeds will lead to a reduction of maximal 50% in the genome profiling experiment. For example, genes that are only expressed from the paternal genome would show such reduced expression levels (Figure S1B). Likewise, maternally expressed genes that require activation by a paternally expressed gene(s) would be downregulated (Figure S1C), whereas genes that are acted upon by paternally expressed repressors were expected to be upregulated in the microarray screen (Figure S1D).. When we compared the transcriptional profiles of Ler x cdka;1 versus Ler x Col seeds 3 DAP, we detected 17223 nuclear genes that were expressed in all biological replicates of both mutant (cdka;1 set) and wild-type (WT set) seed profiles. Our result is in good agreement with a set of genes identified by Goldberg & Harada laboratories (GH) in globular stage seeds of Arabidopsis Ws-0 plants as 68% of our genes were also identified by GH, and our gene set included >90% of the GH globular seed gene set (Figure 1A; http://seedgenenetwork.net, [44]).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001303.g001. Figure 1. . Analysis of cdka;1 microarray profiles.. (A) Venn diagram representing overlap of genes expressed in globular stage seeds of Arabidopsis Ws-0 plants (red) and genes expressed in 3 DAP seeds from Ler plants pollinated with Col cdka;1 pollen (green). As high as 67.8% of the cdka;1 set and 90,7% of the GH set genes were found in the overlap. Gene numbers refer to the reference set of genes (see material and methods). GH: Goldberg & Harada laboratories (http://www.seedgenenetwork.net). (B) Boxplot showing the reduced relative expression of known maternally imprinted (blue background) and paternally imprinted (pink background) genes in the Ler x cdka;1 versus Ler x Col seeds. Calculations are based on values taken from three independent biological replicas. (C) GO functional classification of microarray expression data. Deregulated genes identified in the microarray experiment were functionally classified regarding their molecular function using the GO Slim classification system (http://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/). The total number of unique GO-term:locus assignments for each group is indicated (n). The functional classifications of all genes present on the microarray (On microarray) and all genes having a present call (All expressed) have been included for comparison. The cut-off for deregulation is 0.8 for the downregulated group, and 1.5 and 1.2 for the upregulated groups.. . . . To further validate the quality of our dataset, we examined the expression pattern of genes known to be preferentially expressed from the paternal allele. To date, only three genes have been identified that show a predominant paternal expression pattern; PHE1, HDG3 and At5g62110, where all three genes were found to be downregulated in our arrays (Figure S1E), supporting our working hypothesis that paternally expressed genes can be detected amongst downregulated genes. In addition, out of seven imprinted maternally expressed genes present in our microarray sets, four were also detected as downregulated (Figure S1E). This could reflect required activation by paternal factors (Figure S1C), or be a result of more complex deregulation in response to change in gene dosage. To exclude array artifacts we tested all down-regulated genes by means of real-time PCR and could confirm their deregulation (Figure 1B).. Due to the background noise in the microarray experiment, modest but reproducible downregulation of arithmetic ratios (ar) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 will produce False Discovery Rates (FDR, see materials and methods) with insignificant q values. Since the absence of paternally expressed genes was the simplest hypothesis to account for downregulation, we defined a functional limit for screening purposes that allowed us to detect two out of three known paternally expressed genes in the array. Both PHE1 and HDG3 are detected at q values of 0.35 and a downregulation cutoff of 0.8 (ar). Consequently these values were chosen and used to filter the microarray data.. Using these criteria, a set of 602 genes was extracted (q0.35 and ar 0.8), subsequently called Down 0.8. For upregulation, we worked with two gene sets. For the first set, Up 1.2, we used parameters equivalent to the downregulated set (q0.35 and ar 1.2), which resulted in a set of 1030 genes. For the second set, Up 1.5, resulting in 323 genes, we chose ar 1.5, a threshold for deregulation commonly used in genome-wide expression studies (Table S3).. To test whether the deregulated genes could preferentially be attributed to a certain seed structure, we compared our data to gene sets expressed in different seed regions and compartments of globular stage seeds using data generated by Goldberg & Harada (GH) laboratories available at http://seedgenenetwork.net. [44]. The overlap between the upregulated gene sets and the GH embryo, seed coat and endosperm was significantly lower than expected for independent sets of genes, indicating that among the upregulated genes we preferentially find those that are below the detection limit of the GH analyses. However looking at the downregulated genes, the picture was different. While we found slightly less overlap than expected by chance for the GH embryo set, the overlap was clearly larger than expected by chance for GH seed-coat (1.2<2.7e-07) and even more significant for the GH endosperm (rf =1.3, p<2.0e-13, Figure S2A, S2B).. . . Lack of the paternal genome results in the downregulation of a group of MADS-box Type-I Mgamma transcription factors. In order to functionally classify the deregulated gene sets according to their molecular functions we used the GO Slim classification system (Figure 1C). Only for the GO Slim term Transcription factor activity we find a higher percentage and significant over-representation of both up- and down-regulated groups when compared to all genes on the array/all genes expressed. Since key regulators of seed development are likely to be transcription factors (TF), we analyzed this class in detail.. When comparing the fraction of deregulated genes among the different TF families, the Mgamma MADS-box transcription factors clearly stood out with more than 60% of the seed expressed members being downregulated in Ler x cdka;1 arrays (Figure S3A, S3B). We therefore focused on this MADS Type-I class for further analysis. Searches in publically available expression databases (www.genevestigator.com, Figure S4) revealed that all identified genes were exclusively expressed in the seed and predominantly in the endosperm. From the identified Type-I Mgamma MADS-box genes, we selected AGL36 for further in depth analysis (Figure S4). AGL36 was the previously undescribed Mgamma candidate that interacted with the highest number of described AGLs in a Y2H screen performed by de Folter et al [45]. Both AGL36 and PHE1 have been shown to interact with AGL62, which plays a major role in endosperm development [45], [46]. Within the Mgamma class, AGL36 clusters together with AGL34 and AGL90. [47], which are both also detected as downregulated in our microarray experiment (Figure S4). AGL36 shares 85.7% and 84% nucleotide identity with AGL34 and AGL90, respectively (Figure S8). On the amino acid level this results in of 80.2% similarity of AGL36 with AGL34 and 83.9% similarity with AGL90.. . . AGL36 is only expressed from its maternal allele. Real-time PCR measurement of AGL36 relative expression level three days after pollination (3 DAP) in Ler ovules fertilized with either Col or cdka;1 pollen confirmed that AGL36 expression was reduced in cdka;1 fertilized seeds, (27% when normalized towards ACT11, and 36% when normalized towards GAPA) compared to wild-type seeds (Figure 2A).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001303.g002. Figure 2. . AGL36 is only expressed from the maternal genome.. (A) Real-time PCR analysis showing AGL36 expression in Ler x cdka;1 relative to Ler x Col seeds 3 DAP. Gray bars represent Ler x Col expression levels, black bars represent the Ler x cdka;1 expression levels. Left section: AGL36 normalized to ACT11 levels. Right section: AGL36 normalized to GAPA levels. Average values from three independent biological replicas are shown. Error bars indicate standard deviation (STDEV). (B) Schematic overview of AGL36 SNP analysis. The presence of a SNP between Col and Ler ecotypes (C-T conversion respectively) allows the amplified AGL36 cDNA PCR product from the Col ecotype to be digested with AlwNI restriction enzyme, while the Ler ecotype remains undigested. (C) AGL36 is maternally expressed. Seeds obtained from Col x Ler and Ler x Col crosses were harvested at 3 DAP followed by AGL36 RT-PCR, AlwNI digestion and subsequent Bioanalyzer analysis. Genomic Col and Ler were included as controls (Left section, first two lanes). Digestion products of two independent biological replicas of maternal Col x Ler pollen crosses produced only Col bands, indicating maternal expression (Middle section). Similarly, the digestion products of two independent biological replicas of maternal Ler x Col pollen produced only Ler bands, indicating maternal expression (Left section). The intensities of the bands are represented as concentrations (nmol/L), and create a basis for comparison. 100 ng DNA was used as template for each PCR reaction.. . . . To determine whether AGL36 has parental-specific expression, we took advantage of an AGL36 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) existing between the Col and Ler ecotypes. This SNP allows the PCR product of Col cDNA to be digested by AlwNI, leaving the Ler cDNA PCR product intact (Figure 2B). We performed reciprocal crosses between Col and Ler ecotypes, and analyzed the digested RT-PCR fragments on an Agilent Bioanalyzer Lab-on-a-Chip, allowing accurate measurement of fragment sizes and their concentrations. When Colmaternal is crossed with Lerpaternal, we only detected the Col bands (165 bp+234 bp) after AlwNI digestion, indicating only maternal expression (Figure 2C). Similarly, in the reciprocal cross when Lermaternal is fertilized with Colpaternal pollen, the cDNA PCR digest resulted only in an undigested band (399 bp) originating from Ler, indicative of maternal expression (Figure 2C). This testified that AGL36 was only expressed from the maternal genome after fertilization and thus identified as a novel imprinted gene.. . . AGL36 is imprinted throughout early seed development. AGL36 expression level in wild-type seeds (Ler x Col) at different stages of seed development was monitored over a period of 12 days after pollination. Initially, a low expression level was detected (1 DAP), followed by a rapid increase and subsequent peak in AGL36 expression at 4 DAP, when the embryo is at the late globular stage of development, before declining (Figure 3A). At the embryo heart stage, corresponding to 6 DAP, AGL36 expression had decreased to similar levels as 1 DAP. To address whether AGL36 imprinting is maintained throughout its expression cycle, we performed a SNP analysis of the RT-PCR product obtained from Ler x Col crosses harvested during 1 to 12 DAP (Figure 3B). We found that AGL36 expression is originating from the maternal genome (Ler) throughout the experiment. By plotting the molarities of the maternal band obtained by Agilent Bioanalyzer, an expression profile closely identical to the pattern obtained in the real-time PCR analysis was found (Figure 3C).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001303.g003. Figure 3. . AGL36 is imprinted throughout its expression cycle.. (A) AGL36 expression profile. Calculations were done using 3 DAP values as reference point, giving other obtained expression values relative to the 3 DAP expression level. Samples were taken at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 DAP. The graph represents the average relative expression values obtained from two independent biological parallels where the RNA from each biological sample gave rise to two independent cDNA syntheses (technical replica). The indicated STDEV is derived from the two independent biological parallels. The AGL36 transcript levels were normalized to ACT11 levels. (B) RT-PCR digest of the SNP containing region analyzed by the Bioanalyzer show that AGL36 imprinting is maintained throughout seed development. Samples were taken at time-points as indicated for each lane. A representative light micrograph of each DAP stage is shown. Only maternal (Ler) AGL36 expression was found when present. Genomic Ler and Col DNA were included as controls. 100 ng DNA/cDNA was used as template for each PCR reaction. The intensities of the bands are represented as concentrations (nmol/L). Note, weak paternal bands obtained at 2 DAP were below the detection limit for measurement on our instrument (0.1 ng/l0.4 nmol/L). Intensities below the detection point of the instrument are indicated as b.d. The displayed SNP picture is representing one of four independent runs (2BR and 2TR). (C) Visual representation of the obtained intensities of maternal bands in B) represented as concentrations (nmol/L).. . . . To rule out that the observed maternal expression is due to expression of AGL36 in the ovule integument, which is a maternal tissue, we generated a reporter construct consisting of 1752 bp of the AGL36 promoter region fused to a GUS reporter (pAGL36::GUS) (Figure 4A). Single-copy lines carrying this construct were used in reciprocal crosses with wild-type Ler and Col plants to examine GUS expression at 3 and 6 DAP. When inherited maternally, pAGL36::GUS expression in the seed was indeed found to be restricted only to the fertilization product (Figure 4B, Figure S7D). In the reciprocal cross, when pAGL36::GUS was inherited from the paternal genome, no GUS expression was detected, (Figure 4C, Figure S7E). Consistent with the SNP analysis, this demonstrated that AGL36 was imprinted and only maternally active throughout its expression cycle. Furthermore, the 1.7 Kb promoter fragment used in this analysis appears to be sufficient to confer parent-of-origin specific expression of the reporter.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001303.g004. Figure 4. . pAGL36::GUS is expressed only from its maternal allele (and only in the fertilization products).. (A) A pAGL36::GUS construct was generated using 1752 bp of the promoter region of AGL36 that spans the ATG start codon. Transposable element sequences (hAT, Helitron, Arnoldy, DNA transposons, MuDR and Pogo transposons) in 5and 3regulatory regions are color coded as indicated. The numbers indicate the positions on Chromosome 5 (http://gbrowse.arabidopsis.org). Note, Helitron and Arnoldy transposable elements in the pAGL36::GUS promoter region. Plants expressing the transgene were used either as maternal (B) or paternal (C) partners in crosses with wild-type plants. Samples were taken at 3 DAP (left panel) and 6 DAP (right panel). pAGL36::GUS is absent in the seed-coat and only maternally expressed in the endosperm. The pAGL36::GUS signal is increased in 6 DAP versus 3 DAP samples.. . . . . . AGL36 is not required for seed survival. To further investigate the biological function of AGL36, we screened the Koncz T-DNA collection for insertions [48]. We identified a mutant line, agl36-1, harboring a single T-DNA insertion 16 bp upstream of the AGL36 ATG start codon (Figure S5A). The agl36-1 line showed Mendelian segregation of the T-DNA insertion, as 75% of the plants were resistant to Hygromycin (N=1025, chi2=0,83, Table S1).. To test the transmission through the male and female gametes directly, reciprocal crosses of both hemizygous and homozygous agl36-1 mutant plants with wild-type plants were performed (Table S1). In a reciprocal cross, a hemizygous mutant will segregate 50% of the T-DNA resistance marker if the disrupted gene is not vital for gametophyte transmission or function. Thus, gametophyte requirement can be scored directly as reduced frequency of resistant plants [49]. In reciprocal crosses with agl36-1, no transmission distortion through female or male gametophytes could be observed (N=661, chi2=0,13 and N=1015, chi2=0,00 respectively, Table S1).. The position of the T-DNA insertion in agl36-1 predicts AGL36 expression failure, and indeed real-time PCR analyses of 3 DAP seeds of homozygous agl36-1-/- plants compared to Col wild-type indicate a 1000-fold AGL36 downregulation in the mutant seeds (Figure S5B). In line with an imprinted and maternal-only expression of AGL36, close to 50% reduction of the transcript level was observed in 3 DAP hemizygous agl36-1+/- seeds (Figure S5B). We thereby concluded that agl36-1 represents a loss-of-function allele of AGL36.. Although depletion of AGL36 did not interfere with the fitness of the mutant allele in our experimental system, we have shown that AGL36 is specifically expressed from the maternal allele in the fertilization product, in a time frame between 2 and 6 DAP. To investigate whether this was reflected morphologically or developmentally in the developing seed, we compared embryo and endosperm development in wild-type and homozygous agl36-1-/- seeds within the AGL36 expression time frame.. After fertilization of the egg and the central cell, the endosperm in Arabidopsis undergoes three syncytial rounds of nuclear divisions before the first asymmetric division of the zygote that creates the apical embryo proper and the basal suspensor that connects the embryo proper and the maternal tissue (Figure S5C). At the 2 DAP stage, no obvious difference could be observed between wild-type and agl36-1-/- seeds, both typically harboring a 1-2 cell embryo proper and a 16-32 nucleated endosperm (Figure S5C, left section). The embryo continues to divide through radial, longitudinal and transverse divisions to produce the so-called globular stage at 4 DAP (Figure S5C, middle section). The endosperm also undergoes 3-4 syncytial nuclear divisions and remains uncellularized as cell proliferation at the upper half of the embryo forms the cotyledon primordia at the so-called heart stage at 6 DAP (Figure S5C, right section). Although the main AGL36 expression peak occurs during this time frame, no obvious deviation between wild-type and agl36-1-/- could be observed at these stages. Similarly, using an endosperm specific pFIS2::GUS reporter [33], a wild-type endosperm division pattern was observed in agl36-1+/- seeds (Figure S5D).. . . MET1 is required for AGL36 imprinting. The majority of imprinted, maternally expressed genes identified in Arabidopsis so far have been shown to be paternally silenced by mechanisms involving symmetric CG methylation, maintained by MET1 [11], [18], [19]. Although not directly linked to imprinting, methylation can also be directed by CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) that has specificity for CNG, and members of the DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE (DRM) family; DRM1 and DRM2, that are mainly responsible for asymmetric CHH methylation [50]. In order to address the involvement of DNA methylation in the regulation of paternal AGL36 expression, we performed SNP analyses of 3 DAP ovules from reciprocal crosses with mutants that have been shown to be involved in DNA methylation. In the SNP RT-PCR analysis of mutant pollen crossed to wild-type, paternal AGL36 expression is expected if the tested mutants are involved in AGL36 imprinting.. CMT3 DNA methylation has been reported to be guided to specific sites by KRYPTONITE (KYP) H3K9 methylation [51]. When mutant cmt3-7 and kyp-2 pollen were crossed to Col wild-type plants, no difference in AGL36 expression was observed (Figure 5A). In the reciprocal cross with cmt3-7 also no difference could be detected compared to wild-type expression (Figure S6).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001303.g005. Figure 5. . The effect of DNA methylation on parental AGL36 expression.. (A,B) SNP analyses of 3 DAP seeds from crosses with DNA methylation mutants. The amplified SNP containing regions of AGL36 and FWA cDNA were digested with AlwNI and NheI, respectively, and analyzed in a Bioanalyzer. (A) Homozygous cmt3-7, kyp-2, and ago4-1 mutants in the Ler ecotype were used as pollen donors to pollinate Col plants, while homozygous drm1;drm2 and heterozygous ddm1-2 mutants in the Ws-2 and Col ecotype respectively, were used as male to fertilize Ler ovules. No paternal AGL36 expression could be detected in these crosses. (B) Upper panel: Hemizygous met1-4+/- in the Col ecotype reciprocally crossed with Ler wild-type plants show that the paternal allele of AGL36 is expressed when met1-4 is crossed as male. No paternal bands are observed when met1-4 is used as the maternal cross partner. Using pollen from first generation met1-4-/- homozygous plants in a Ler x met1-4-/- cross gives rise to prominent bands of the digested paternal Col expression product. In the reciprocal met1-4-/- x Ler cross no paternal expression can be detected. Lower panel: FWA control using the same tissue as above showing imprinted expression of FWA in dependence of MET1. Paternal FWA expression was observed when plants hemizygous and homozygous for met1-4 were crossed as male to Ler wild-type.. . . . DRM1 and DRM2 are mainly responsible for asymmetric DNA CHH methylation [50] and rely on small interfering RNAs, processed by ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4), for target template guidance [52]. In our assays, fertilization by pollen lacking DRM1;DRM2 and pollen lacking AGO4 had no effect on the AGL36 expression pattern (Figure 5A). Likewise, AGL36 expression in the reciprocal cross was identical to wild-type (Figure S6).. DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1 (DDM1) is involved in maintenance of DNA methylation [53]. In our SNP RT-PCR analyses where mutant ddm1-2 pollen was used to fertilize wild-type ovules, paternal AGL36 expression was not activated (Figure 5A). In summary, CMT3, KYP, DRM1;DRM2, AGO4 and DDM1 appear not to be involved in the establishment nor maintenance of AGL36 imprinting (Figure 5A, Figure S6).. However, paternal AGL36 expression was detected when plants hemizygous for the met1-4 mutation were used as pollen donor in crosses with wild-type Ler (Figure 5B). In the reciprocal cross, using met1+/- as the maternal partner, no AGL36 expression from the paternal genome could be observed (Figure 5B). Furthermore, we performed crosses using pollen from homozygous met1-4 parents. When first generation homozygous met1 plants were used as pollen donor on wild-type plants, prominent AGL36 expression from the paternal Col genome could be observed (Figure 5B). This strongly suggests that the repression of the paternal copy of AGL36 is lifted due to the met1-4 mutation, and that MET1 is required for maintaining paternal inactivation of AGL36. In the reciprocal crosses, only expression from the maternal genome could be detected, both in the heterozygous and the homozygous met1-4 situation, further substantiating the requirement of MET1 in the male germline in order to maintain AGL36 imprinting (Figure 5B). Maternal AGL36 expression levels using homozygous met1-4 as the maternal cross partner appeared to be equal to maternal levels in the reciprocal crosses (Figure 5B). This opens for the interpretation that DNA methylation is not required for the regulation of maternal AGL36 expression.. . . Silencing of vegetative AGL36 expression involves MET1. In public expression databases, AGL36 is reported to be expressed in the seed and more precisely in the endosperm [54] (Figure S4). In order to monitor AGL36 expression in vegetative tissues and its dependence on DNA methylation, we performed a real-time PCR experiment on vegetative tissues from reciprocal Ler x Col crosses and homozygous met1-4 tissues. In biological replicates of progenies from both reciprocal crosses, weak AGL36 expression ranging from 1-6% of the seed expression level could be detected in seedlings, leaves and flowers (Figure 6A). This showed that AGL36 was expressed throughout the plant life cycle, although at very low levels. In the same experiment, we monitored expression in met1-4 tissues. AGL36 expression levels were 50-90-fold higher in met1-4 leaves compared to seed expression levels (Figure 6A). In a direct comparison, expression levels were elevated 2000-fold in homozygous met1-4 leaves compared to wild-type Col x Ler leaves (Figure 6B). In flowers, the upregulation was more than 20-fold in met1-4 compared to wild-type Col x Ler flowers (Figure 6C). In conclusion, these data showed that silencing of AGL36 in vegetative tissues involves MET1, suggesting that the absence of maintenance DNA methylation elevates vegetative AGL36 expression beyond the maternal expression levels found in seeds.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001303.g006. Figure 6. . AGL36 expression is controlled by MET1 and DME.. (A) Real-time PCR of AGL36 expression levels in seeds, seedlings, leaves and flowers in F1 progenies of Ler x Col (gray bars), and Col x Ler (black bars) plants. AGL36 expression level in leaves and flowers of met1-/- selfed plants in the Col ecotype are shown in the two rightmost bars. All expression levels shown are relative to the AGL36 expression levels in 3 DAP seeds. (B-C) Expression levels of AGL36 in leaves (B) and flowers (C) of met1-/- plants (Col) relative to expression level in F1 progenies of Col x Ler plants.

SNP analyses of 3 DAP seeds (left) and F1 hybrid flowers (right) obtained from Col x Ler and Ler x Col crosses. The amplified SNP containing region of AGL36 was AlwNI digested and analyzed in a Bioanalyzer. Seeds express AGL36 only from the maternal genome (left). Flowers express AGL36 biparentally (Note both Ler and Col bands (right)). The electropherograms represent one BR. Peaks are representing the bands shown in the graph. Asterisk; digested Col product, Arrowhead; undigested Ler product. (E) Real-time PCR expression levels of FWA, FIS2 and AGL36 in dme-6 x Col vs. wild-type seeds 3 and 6 DAP. Graphs represent the average relative expression from four independent BRs. Values for FIS2 are calculated based on 3 BRs as the value for the fourth BR was clearly out of range. Samples used in the first BR gave rise to two TRs. STDEV is derived from the independent BRs. ACT11 is the reference gene used.. . . . . . AGL36 is biparentally expressed in vegetative tissues. In order to investigate the parental expression pattern of AGL36 in vegetative tissues, we performed SNP analyses of flowers from F1 hybrids of Ler and Col reciprocal crosses. In both reciprocal crosses, AGL36 appeared to be expressed equally from the parental Ler and Col genomes, indicating biparental expression in flowers (Figure 6D). This indicates that parental-specific expression, i.e. imprinting of AGL36, as expected, only takes place in the seed and that a low basal biparental expression is present throughout the plant life cycle. Interestingly, biallelic expression in flowers suggests that further silencing of AGL36 takes place in the male germline before uniparental expression in the seed (Figure 6D).. . . AGL36 is controlled by DEMETER. According to our data, the action of MET1 suppresses AGL36 expression throughout the vegetative phase and this suppression is maintained in the fertilization product through the male germline. AGL36 imprinting thus requires specific activation of the maternal allele. DNA demethylation by DME has previously been shown to mediate maternal-specific gene expression in the endosperm [11], [18], [19], [24], and we therefore investigated AGL36 expression in dme-6 mutant plants. Since dme cannot be maintained in a homozygous state, we harvested siliques of dme-6+/- heterozygous plants pollinated with Col pollen at 3 and 6 DAP. We monitored the relative expression by means of real-time PCR using FWA and FIS2 as controls. At 3 DAP, both controls were downregulated by 690.09% and 530.30% respectively (Figure 6E), in line with a lack of functional DME in 50% of the seeds in heterozygous dme-6+/- plants. AGL36 was downregulated in a similar manner as FIS2 (410.20%), suggesting that DME is indeed involved in early activation of the maternal AGL36 allele.. . . Expression of maternal AGL36 is regulated by the PRC2 FIS-complex. We also tested the expression of FWA and FIS2 in 6 DAP samples and found that their downregulation were sustained as predicted (Figure 6E). However, to our surprise AGL36 expression in dme-6+/- seeds was elevated more than 50-fold (Figure 6E). This result was unexpected, and implicated a more intricate regulation of AGL36.. DME is required for the activation of MEA, the core histone H3K27 methyltransferase (HMTase) of the PRC2 FIS-complex [46], [55], [56]. To determine whether PRC2 FIS is involved in the regulation of AGL36, we analyzed the relative expression of AGL36 over time (1 to 12 DAP) in mea mutant seeds compared to wild-type (Figure 7A). While AGL36 expression in wild-type seeds was at its maximum at 4 DAP, we observed that AGL36 expression in mea seeds surpassed the maximum levels of wild-type at 4 DAP, and reached its highest levels at around 6 DAP. At this point, the AGL36 relative expression in mea mutant seeds was approximately 40-fold higher than wild-type expression at the same stage, and 7-fold higher than the maximum AGL36 level found in wild-type seeds at 4 DAP (Figure 7A). Our data thus indicate that the FIS-complex is indeed a repressor of AGL36 expression, and could also explain the elevated AGL36 expression level in 3 DAP dme-6+/- seeds (Figure 6E). In line with these findings, we found highly elevated AGL36 relative expression levels in mutant seeds from three different mutant alleles of mea (Figure 7C). Similar results were also obtained with mutants of other components of the FIS PRC2 complex (FIS2, FIE and MSI1, data not shown).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001303.g007. Figure 7. . The maternal AGL36 allele is regulated by the PRC2 FIS-complex.. (A) Real-time PCR AGL36 expression profile in 1-12 DAP wild-type and mea mutant seeds. 3 DAP values were used as the reference point for calculations. Samples were taken at indicated time points. The graph represents average expression obtained from two BRs and subsequent two TRs. STDEVs are derived from biological parallels. ACT11 is the reference gene used. (B) The FIS-complex regulates the maternal allele of AGL36. The PCR product of AGL36 SNP region obtained from mea x Col fertilized seeds was AlwNI digested and analyzed. Genomic Ler and Col DNA were included as controls. The intensities of the represented bands (nmol/L), allows comparison between different time-points. Note, unsustainable weak paternal signals at 2 and 3 DAP are below the detection limit for measurement on our instrument (0.1 ng/l0.4 nmol/L) and indicated as b.d. The chart represents the obtained concentrations from each sample. The displayed SNP picture is representing one of four different runs (2BRs and 2TRs).

ACT11 is the reference gene used. (D) Real-time PCR expression level of FWA, FIS2, AGL36 and MPC in mea-9 x Col vs. wild-type seeds 3 and 6 DAP. Graphs represent the average relative expression values obtained from four independent BRs. Samples used in the first biological parallel gave rise to two TRs. STDEVs are derived from the independent BRs. The transcript levels were normalized to ACT11 levels.. . . . To investigate whether FIS activity was exerted on the maternal and/or paternal allele of AGL36, we performed SNP analyses on the RT-PCR product of AGL36 obtained from mea mutant plants (in Ler background) pollinated with Col wild-type pollen. We found that AGL36 is expressed only from its maternal allele in the mea background throughout the duration of our experiment (Figure 7B). In comparison to the expression pattern in wild-type (Figure 3B), strong ectopic maternal expression was also observed at 9 and 12 DAP stages. No paternal expression could be observed in these stages. By plotting the molarities of the maternal band detected by the Agilent Bioanalyzer, an expression profile for the maternal allele could be generated (Figure 7B, lower panel). This demonstrated that in the absence of MEA, AGL36 expression continues to increase after 4 DAP, and although the intensity decreases from 6 DAP, high level of AGL36 is maintained at 12 DAP. Hence, the FIS-complex represses the maternal allele of AGL36 after the 3 DAP stage.. To further substantiate that maternal AGL36 expression is regulated by the maternal action of MEA, we crossed mea mutant plants with pollen expressing the pAGL36::GUS reporter line. Here, no obvious activation of the paternal transgene could be observed at 3 DAP (Figure S7A). Surprisingly, at 6 DAP, corresponding to embryo heart stage, weak expression of the paternal copy in the embryo could be found (Figure S7A). In addition, we performed reciprocal crosses with the pAGL36::GUS reporter line in mutant mea background. When the transgene was contributed from the female side in mea background, a GUS signal was found in 3 DAP stages that increased drastically up to 6 DAP (Figure S7B). In the reciprocal cross however, no expression could be observed (Figure S7C).. The E(z) class of H3K27 histone methyltransferases (HMTases) in Arabidopsis consists of MEA, SWINGER (SWN) and CURLY LEAF (CLF) that participate in different PRC2 complexes. To test whether AGL36 repression is a specific function of FISMEA PRC2, we analyzed AGL36 expression in homozygous swn-4 and clf-2 seeds. For mutants of both HMTases values similar to the wild-type situation were found, and in conclusion AGL36 appear to be specifically regulated by FISMEA PRC2 (Figure 7C).. In summary, maternal AGL36 expression appears to be repressed specifically by the maternal action of FIS PRC2.. . . PRC2 acts on a subset of MET1/DME-regulated genes. For all genes known to be imprinted by PRC2, the FIS-complex is involved in the repression of the silenced allele [25]-[27], [30], [56]. Our data suggest that silencing of the paternal AGL36 allele requires MET1 whereas the maternal allele is activated by DME. Modulation of female AGL36 expression by PRC2 thus represents a novel mechanism in this type of gene expression system, and adds an additional level of parent-of-origin specific gene expression to the scheme. In order to investigate if this regulation applies to other genes imprinted by the dual action of MET1/DME [11], [18], [19], we analyzed the relative expression levels of FWA, FIS2, AGL36 and MPC in a mea mutant. At 3 DAP expression levels were unchanged or slightly downregulated (0.40-0.99) for all genes tested (Figure 7D). However, while the expression of FWA and FIS2 remained stable at 6 DAP, AGL36 and MPC levels were elevated up to 80-fold (Figure 7D). Thus, genes imprinted by means of MET1/DME can be divided in two classes based on their dependence of FIS PRC2 for additional regulation of the expressed allele. Whereas one class appears not to be regulated by FIS PRC2, the other class depends on the action of the FIS-complex for developmental regulation of its expression..
PMC4877946	Results. Forty eight putative drought-induced WRKY genes were identified from a comparison between de novo transcriptome sequencing data of wheat without or with drought treatment. TaWRKY1 and TaWRKY33 from WRKY Groups III and II, respectively, were selected for further investigation. Subcellular localization assays revealed that TaWRKY1 and TaWRKY33 were localized in the nuclei in wheat mesophyll protoplasts. Various abiotic stress-related cis-acting elements were observed in the promoters of TaWRKY1 and TaWRKY33. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that TaWRKY1 was slightly up-regulated by high-temperature and abscisic acid (ABA), and down-regulated by low-temperature. TaWRKY33 was involved in high responses to high-temperature, low-temperature, ABA and jasmonic acid methylester (MeJA). Overexpression of TaWRKY1 and TaWRKY33 activated several stress-related downstream genes, increased germination rates, and promoted root growth in Arabidopsis under various stresses. TaWRKY33 transgenic Arabidopsis lines showed lower rates of water loss than TaWRKY1 transgenic Arabidopsis lines and wild type plants during dehydration. Most importantly, TaWRKY33 transgenic lines exhibited enhanced tolerance to heat stress..
PMC3410254	Results. . Community contribution to literature annotation at TAIR. Since the launch of the TAIR-journal collaboration in 2008 and the TOAST community annotation tool in May 2010, community annotation has formed an increasingly important part of the total annotation workflow at TAIR. Figure 2 shows a history of TAIR annotations using research articles spanning the years 2000-10, highlighting contributions made by the community over the years. Between February 2008 and August 2011, we incorporated 20601 community annotations into TAIR, including11870 GO annotations, 8517 PO annotations and 214 annotations of protein interactions. These came in a variety of submission formats and mechanisms including a web interface at ASPB, TAIR spreadsheets, author emails and TOAST. Several submissions were based on high-throughput experiments where hundreds or even thousands of genes were characterized. 89% (113/127) of the articles that received community annotations in 2010 were published in journals with existing TAIR collaborations, including 65% published in Plant Physiology and 24% published in the other 9 collaborating journals. The remaining 11% of articles were published in journals that are not currently collaborating with TAIR. These submitters independently found TOAST or another TAIR submission method without the help of author instructions and used it to provide annotations to TAIR.. Figure 2.Literature-based annotation at TAIR (2000-2010). The total number of research articles containing Arabidopsis gene-related information in the TAIR database is represented in blue. In green and orange are the number of articles used for controlled vocabulary annotations by either TAIR or the community, respectively.. . . Community annotation contributors. The demographics of the contributors are similar to that of TAIR users overall, with 38% from the USA, 30% from Asia, 26% from Europe and 6% from other countries. The three largest job groupings were Professor/Asst. Professor/Assoc. Professor/Group Leader (49%), postdoctoral fellows (15%) and graduate students (5%). 21 out of 47 submitters in our study had contacted TAIR in the past. This includes both submitters that provided annotations spontaneously and those that had to be reminded. Three of the submitters provided annotations for more than one article in this study, and five were not among the authors on the article for which the annotations were submitted.. . . Distribution of community submissions over articles. In all, we analyzed a total of 503 community submissions associated to 50 research articles discussing Arabidopsis gene function. Figure 3 shows the distribution of submissions over the 50 articles. Most articles resulted in between 1 and 6 annotations, with the distribution tailing off to around 25, with 3 outlier articles having 32, 60 and 105 annotations. The articles with 32 or more annotations were studies of gene families, where expression patterns and protein-protein interactions of many or all of the family members were tested.. Figure 3.Distribution of community annotation counts. The bins group articles by number of associated community annotations.. . . Analysis of community annotation content. . Completeness of community annotations. Curators evaluated completeness by examining the articles together with their community annotations and searching for experimental results for which the submitter failed to make an annotation. 25 out of the 50 articles analyzed had no missing annotations. Those with missing annotations varied from 3% complete to 96% complete, with the average degree of completeness at 81%. In total, submitters captured 72% of all possible annotations for this set of articles. Examples of annotations missed by submitters include submissions of a molecular function annotation but not a corresponding biological process annotation, submission of annotations for only a subset of genes experimentally characterized in an article, or submission of a PO developmental stage annotation (1 flower meristem visible) but not the corresponding anatomical structure term (flower meristem). Figure 4A shows the distribution of annotations added by a curator. For most articles 7 or fewer annotations were added, with half (25) having no added annotations. For 3 articles, more than 10 annotations were added by the curator (11, 29 and 93 added annotations). These articles described the characterization of more than one gene using several different experimental approaches.. Figure 4.Analysis of community annotations. (A) Completeness of community annotations. The 50 articles analyzed are shown on X-axis, and the total number of curator and community annotations per paper shown on the Y-axis. The number of community annotations is shown in blue, and the number of added curator annotations in orange. (B) Experimental support for community annotations. Supported community annotations in blue, unsupported community annotations in orange, out of scope annotations in green. (C) Level of specificity of community annotations. Papers shown on X-axis, total number of community annotations per paper shown on Y-axis. Community annotations with same specificity as curator annotations are shown in blue, more specific community annotations in orange, more specific curator annotations in green.. . . Experimental support of community annotations. Curators evaluated experimental support by verifying that experimental data in the article supported the annotation, and that the submitter chose the correct AGI locus code, GO or PO term, and evidence code to describe the experimental result. As shown in Figure 4B, only 2 out of the 50 articles analyzed were used for unsupported annotations, and an additional 6 articles were used for annotations that were considered out of scope for TAIR. Overall, 489 out of 503 (97.2%) of all annotations were categorized as supported, 2 out of 503 (0.4%) as unsupported and 12 out of 503 (2.4%) were out of scope.. Unsupported annotations are those that assert that a gene product has a functional annotation but experimental evidence for that assertion is not present in the article that is provided as the reference for the annotation. For example, one submission linked a gene product with the term protein kinase inhibitor activity but there were no kinase assay results presented in the article. Evidence for this activity may have been in another publication but since the author instructions requested only annotations directly supported by experimental results presented within the article itself, such submissions were considered invalid. In another example, a gene product was linked to the term nucleus; however, the GFP fusion experiments presented in the article showed localization to the trans-Golgi network/early endosome.. Annotations were classified as out of scope if they represented data that TAIR cannot capture in a structured annotation as described above. Examples include genetic interaction data and phenotype related data. Such data fall into the category of other annotations. We add this type of information as free text to the appropriate records.. . . Specificity of community annotations. Curators evaluated the specificity of community annotations by examining the GO or PO term chosen by the submitter, the supporting text and figures within the article, and related terms within the GO or PO hierarchy to determine whether the chosen term was at the appropriate level of specificity given the experimental results presented in the article. 455 of the 489 (93%) experimentally supported annotations, as defined previously, were judged to be at an appropriate level of specificity by the curator (Figure 4C). In 43 of these 455 cases, the phrasing of the term used in the submission did not match a GO or PO term exactly but could be mapped to an existing GO or PO term of similar specificity. For example, the submitted term initiation sites of lateral roots was mapped to lateral root primordium. The remainder consisted of perfect matches to existing GO or PO terms.. For 15 out of the 489 experimentally supported annotations, the term entered by the submitter either did not describe a process or function that falls within the scope of the GO or described a function or process that was within GO's scope but did not yet exist. In these cases, the curator reviewed the paper and found the best existing GO term that represented the experimental result or created a new term for this purpose. New GO or PO terms were requested from and added to the appropriate ontologies either directly by TAIR curators (who are also GO editors) or the PO curators. For example, community annotation to geminivirus-host infection, which as a disease-related process does not fit into scope of terms in the GO, was replaced with response to virus (GO:0009615) and the community annotation to 'environmental stress tolerance' was replaced with the newly created term 'response to photooxidative stress (GO:0080183). A total of 17 out of 489 submissions or 3.5% of all submitter-chosen terms were less specific than those chosen by curators and 2 out of 489 or 0.4% were more specific than those preferred by curators (Table 1)..

Submitter-chosen term less specific than curator-chosen term. As shown in Figure 4C, 10 articles were used to make 17 annotations to terms judged not to be specific enough after curator review. In all but two cases, terms judged to be insufficiently specific by curators could be replaced with a more specific term that already existed within the ontology. For example, in one case a submitter chose ammonium transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0008519) to describe an experimental result. After reviewing the article, the curator chose the more specific GO term high affinity secondary active ammonium transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0015398), a child term of GO:0008519.. In the remaining two cases, the curator chose to create a more specific GO term to describe the experimentally demonstrated result. In one example, the submitter chose the term seed maturation (GO:0010431). After reviewing the article, the curator chose to create the more specific GO term negative regulation of seed maturation (GO:2000692) to replace the more general term chosen by the submitter.. . . Community-chosen term more specific than curator-chosen term. Only two community-chosen terms associated to two articles were judged to be too specific by curators. In one case, the submitter chose the term leaf formation (GO:0010338) and the curator replaced this with the less specific term leaf morphogenesis (GO:0009965), a parent term of leaf formation. After reviewing the figure in the article, the curator observed that the mutation does not affect leaf formation (GO definition: The process that gives rise to a leaf. This process pertains to the initial formation of a structure from unspecified parts.). Rather, leaf morphogenesis (GO definition: The process in which the anatomical structures of the leaf are generated and organized.) is affected as mutant leaves are misshapen but present.. To assess how different in specificity the community-selected terms were from those selected by curators, we counted the distance/minimum number of steps between community- and curator-selected terms (Table 1). One step is equivalent to one direct parent-child relationship between any two terms in an ontology, including relationships between GO molecular function and GO biological process terms. In 8 out of 19 cases where the specificity of terms was changed the community submitted term and curator chosen term were in a direct parent-child relationship. In an additional 11 annotations, the terms were separated by 2-6 intervening terms. It is important to note that although use of a less specific term fails to capture as much information as a more specific term would, annotations to less specific terms are still correct.. . . Author prompting and effect on annotation quality. Of the 50 submissions we studied, 37 (74%) were provided without prompting whereas 13 (26%) were received after curators emailed an articles authors at least once to request submission. To investigate whether the unprompted submitters represented a group more knowledgeable about ontology annotations and therefore more likely to provide high quality annotations, we compared the quality of annotations from these two groups. Submissions sent without a reminder were more likely to be missing some annotations than ones submitted in response to a curator email request (at the 99% significance level). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to number of out-of-scope or unsupported annotations. Both groups contained some members who had been in contact with TAIR previously about other matters, including 17 of the 35 submitters who provided annotations without being contacted by curators (49%) and 4 of the 12 submitters that provided annotations after being prompted (33%). These previous contacts covered a range of issues including submission of another type of data (gene structure, phenotype or gene class symbol) or a job posting request..
PMC2557145	Results. . pop2 is epistatic to ssadh. To dissect the phenotypic effects of ssadh mutations, we first crossed ssadh mutants with pop2 mutants. Such pop2 ssadh double mutants are expected to lack the potential toxic compounds SSA, GHB (Figure 1A), or metabolites derived from their catabolism. However, pop2 ssadh double mutants would not be able to supply NADH and succinate to the TCA cycle via the GABA shunt, similar to ssadh mutants. Several mutations in the GABA-T (POP2) gene encoding the enzyme degrading GABA into SSA (Figure 1A), were described (pop2-1, pop2-2 and pop2-3 mutants; [21]). By comparing the GABA-T (At3g22200) genomic sequence of Arabidopsis with T-DNA flanking genomic sequences deposited in the databases we identified two additional pop2 alleles designated pop2-4 and pop2-5 (Figure 1B). The genomic DNAs of the mutants were characterized by PCR (Materials and Methods) and the junctions between the T-DNAs and the gene were sequenced. Plants homozygous for the pop2-4 or pop2-5 mutations were phenotypically similar to other pop2 alleles [21]. Homozygous plants grew as wild type but were partially sterile with no or very small siliques (Figure 1C).. We crossed plants homozygous for the ssadh-3 allele with heterozygous POP2/pop2-4 plants. The resulting F1 and F2 plants were genotyped by PCR using oligos specific for pop2-4 or ssadh-3 T-DNA inserts (Figure 2B). F2 plants carrying only the ssadh-3 mutation in the homozygous state exhibited a phenotype reminiscent of ssadh mutants (Figure 2A; plants #10 and #22) while plants homozygous for the pop2-4 mutation exhibited a phenotype reminiscent of pop2 mutants (data not shown). Double pop2-4 ssadh-3 mutants homozygous for both mutations displayed a pop2 phenotype. Indeed, pop2 ssadh double mutants grew as wild type plants but failed to form mature siliques (Figure 2A; plants #28 to 44) and produced less seeds (Figure 2D). The presence of the SSADH and GABA-T mRNAs was assessed in the F2 plants, by reverse transcription and PCR amplification using primers specific for SSADH or GABA-T cDNAs. The full-length GABA-T/POP2 mRNA could not be detected in total RNA extracted from plants homozygous for the pop2-4 mutation (Figure 2C; GABA-T primers; plants #28 to 44) in contrast to POP2/POP2 (Figure 2C; GABA-T primers; plants #25 and 10) or pop2-4/POP2 (Figure 2C; GABA-T primers; plant #22) siblings. Similarly, the full-length SSADH mRNA could not be detected in total RNA extracted from plants homozygous for ssadh-3 (Figure 2C; SSADH primers; plants #10 to 44) in contrast to wild type siblings (Figure 3C; SSADH primers; plant #25). Amplification of an elongation factor mRNA worked equally well on all RNA templates (Figure 2C; control primers). Thus, full length mRNAs corresponding to SSADH or GABA-T could not be detected in the double pop2-4 ssadh-3 mutant. We confirmed these results by crossing other pop2 and ssadh mutant alleles. Heterozygous ssadh-2 mutants as pollinators were crossed to pop2-5 plants, and the resulting F1 and F2 plants were genotyped by PCR using oligos specific for the pop2-5 or ssadh-2 T-DNA inserts (Materials and Methods). Double pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutants displayed a phenotype characteristic of pop2 mutants (Figure S1). Altogether, these results indicate that pop2 is epistatic to ssadh because both pop2-4 ssadh-3 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 double mutants are similar to pop2 mutants.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g002.

The active site residues of the pig enzyme are in bold, the pyridoxal phosphate recognition site is underlined, the attachment site is in italics, and the mutated residues are underlined, in bold and italics.. . . . . . EMS-induced mutations in the POP2 gene suppress the phenotype of the ssadh mutation. To gain broader insight into the GABA metabolic pathway and potentially also into regulators of the pathway in Arabidopsis, we decided to isolate suppressors of the ssadh mutation. About 30,000 ssadh-2 seeds were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS; Materials and Methods). None of the resulting M1 plants grew significantly better than ssadh-2 plants, suggesting that no dominant EMS-induced mutations could rescue ssadh-2. Out of 60,000 M2 plants, 137 with improved growth were isolated, potentially carrying recessive suppressor mutations rescuing the ssadh phenotype. The GABA-T gene was sequenced from ten plants that phenotypically resembled pop2 mutants, and two new pop2 mutants with single point mutations were identified designated pop2-6 and pop2-7 (Figure 3A). In ssadh-2 pop2-6, a nucleotide exchange from G to A occurred in exon 11 at position 812 of the GABA-T coding sequence, resulting in an amino acid substitution from glycine to glutamate (Figure 3A) adjacent to an active site residue (Figure 3B; [27]). This line was lost due to its sterility. Plants of another isolated suppressor mutant (ssadh-2 pop2-7) were found to have a nucleotide transition from G to A in exon 13 at position 935 of the GABA-T coding sequence, causing the replacement of glycine with aspartate (Figure 3A) located in the recognition site for binding of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (Figure 3B; [27]). Altogether, our data show that mutations in the GABA-T gene can suppress the ssadh phenotype and that pop2 mutations are epistatic to ssadh mutations.. . . Peroxides accumulate in ssadh mutants but not in pop2 or pop2 ssadh mutants. Previously we reported that ssadh mutants accumulate high levels of ROIs, which is associated with the severe phenotype of these mutants [26]. To further assess the role of the GABA shunt and its derived metabolites in the ssadh phenotype, we tested the accumulation of ROIs in pop2 ssadh plants. After three weeks at 150 mol m-2 s-1 (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours), leaves of ssadh, but not of the wild type, pop2, or pop2 ssadh mutants, were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB), a substance that detects H2O2 in situ [28] (Figure 4). Thus, only ssadh plants accumulate H2O2 as compared to wild type and pop2 or pop2 ssadh.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g004. Figure 4. . H2O2 accumulation in pop2 and ssadh mutants detected by DAB staining.. In situ detection of H2O2 by using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining on pop2-4, ssadh-3, wild type and pop2-4 ssadh-3 plants grown at 150 mol m-2 s-1 white light (WL) for three weeks (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours; temperature day/night, 20/15C). Numbers indicate the percentages of leaves showing DAB staining similar to that presented in the pictures (total number of leaves observed was 12 for wild type, 17 for ssadh-3, 11 for pop2-4, and 15 for pop2-4 ssadh-3).. . . . Peroxide contents were then assessed in the different mutants and the wild type by measuring the thermoluminescence of leaf discs at high temperature. For this, the luminescence of a sample subjected to progressive warming is measured [29], [30]. The chemiluminescence bands observed above 60C, beyond the temperature at which photosystem II is fully destroyed by heat, are related to the thermolysis of peroxides [31], [32]. High temperature thermoluminescence (HTL) bands are indicators of oxidative stress in the sample, and the intensities of HTL bands observed at 130C correlates with the lipid peroxide amounts measured in leaves by chemical methods [31]-[33]. Leaves of plants grown under standard conditions were fixed on small aluminum discs, and both, thermoluminescence and fluorescence F0 were recorded (Materials and Methods). Figure 5 shows representative signals obtained at 0.1C s-1 on leaf samples of wild type, pop2, ssadh and pop2 ssadh plants. The thermoluminescence measured at 135C is about four times higher in ssadh mutants than in wild type or pop2 or pop2 ssadh plants, indicating that ssadh mutants contain more peroxides (Figure 5). The fluorescence F0 recorded simultaneously (Figure S2) reaches a peak at about 65C in the wild type and reflects the heat disruption of photosystem II [34]. The lower heat-induced rise of F0 fluorescence recorded in ssadh mutants as well as the downshift of the F0/Temperature curve to lower temperature shows that photosystem II is impaired in ssadh plants possibly due to high ROI levels. Thus, neither pop2 single mutants or pop2 ssadh double mutants accumulate peroxides at levels comparable to the ones detected in ssadh mutants. More specifically, suppression of the ssadh phenotype by mutations in the POP2/GABA-T gene is associated with elimination of excess ROIs.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g005. Figure 5. . Peroxide accumulation measured by high temperature thermoluminescence emission (HTL) in pop2 and ssadh mutants.. High temperature thermoluminescence emission measured in arbitrary units (a.u.) on rosette leaves fixed on aluminum foils using the custom-made apparatus and software described earlier [29]. Wild type (blue), pop2-4 (green), ssadh-3 (red) and pop2-4 ssadh-3 (black) plants were grown in vitro for three weeks under standard conditions (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours; light intensity, 100-150 mol m-2 s-1; temperature day/night, 20/15 C). The experiment was repeated 10 times and one representative signal is shown. Thermoluminescence heating rate; 0.1 C s-1.. . . . . . pop2 ssadh plants are hypersensitive to SSA and GHB. We suspected that the toxic compound responsible for the phenotype of ssadh plants and ROIs accumulation might be either SSA or an SSA-derived metabolite such as GHB since mutations in the GABA-T gene can rescue the ssadh phenotype and only ssadh plants accumulate ROIs. To further test this hypothesis, we grew ssadh-3 and wild type plants in vitro, with various amounts of SSA directly added to the culture medium. In contrast to wild type plants, the development of ssadh-3 seedlings was significantly affected when plants were grown on plates containing 1 mM SSA (Figure 6A). Higher amounts of SSA had an even more drastic effect on the growth of ssadh-3 (SSA 1.5 and 2 mM; Figure 6A). Thus, our results show that ssadh plants are more sensitive to SSA than wild type plants. We then grew wild type, pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutants on plates containing different amounts of either SSA or GHB (Figure 6B). The ssadh single mutants were not included in the analysis because the development of the plants is already severely impaired under standard conditions of growth. Whereas the growth of wild type, pop2, and pop2 ssadh was indistinguishable from one another on agar plates without additional SSA or GHB, growth of the double pop2 ssadh mutant was severely affected on low concentrations of SSA or GHB (0.1 mM SSA and 0.5 mM GHB; Figure 6B). With increasing amounts of either compound, growth of the pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutant was even more affected than that of single ssadh-3 mutants grown on SSA, most likely due to a more severe phenotype of ssadh-2 than ssadh-3 mutants (Figure 6A; [26]). The phenotypes of wild type plants and the pop2 mutant were similar for all concentrations of SSA and GHB tested (Figure 6B); increased inhibition of plant growth was correlated with increased amounts of SSA or GHB in the medium. Our data show that pop2 ssadh plants are more sensitive to GHB or SSA added to the medium than pop2 single mutants. In animals and possibly in plants, SSA and GHB can be interconverted by the SSA reductase / GHB dehydrogenase (Figure 1A). As both GHB and SSA cannot be properly metabolised in pop2 ssadh plants, it is thus likely that one of the two compounds or both are accumulating in a toxic manner in pop2 ssadh plants in which levels of SSA or GHB are artificially increased.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g006. Figure 6. . Phenotypes of ssadh, pop2, pop2 ssadh and wild type plants grown on media containing SSA or GHB.. (A) Phenotype of the ssadh-3 mutants and Col-0 wild type plants grown in vitro for 14 days under standard conditions (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours; light intensity, 100-150 mol m-2 s-1; temperature day/night, 20/15C) with various amount of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) added to the medium. Photographs of Petri dishes and corresponding magnified pictures are shown. The experiment was repeated three times. (B) Phenotype of Col-0 wild type (WT), pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 plants grown on  MS for 18 days under standard conditions (day/night cycle, 16/8 hours; light intensity, 100-150 mol m-2 s-1; temperature day/night, 20/15C) supplemented with the indicated concentrations of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) or gamma-hydroxbutyrate (GHB).. . . . To further assess this hypothesis, GHB contents in leaves of wild type, pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 plants grown on either SSA or GHB were monitored. To our knowledge, no method is currently available to measure SSA levels in plants. In wild type and pop2, GHB is undetectable when grown on  MS medium (0 mM SSA or GHB; Figure 7A,B) but accumulates with increasing amounts of GHB added to the medium (Figure 7B). The pop2 ssadh mutants were found to accumulate GHB in vast amounts even in response to moderate quantities of SSA (Figure 7A) or GHB (Figure 7B) in the medium. Therefore, pop2 ssadh plants accumulate much more GHB in response to either SSA or GHB added to the medium, compared to wild type and pop2 that both respond in a similar way. Both GHB and SSA added to the medium can therefore be metabolized through the SSADH step in pop2 or the wild type but not in pop2 ssadh. Accumulation of GHB and/or possibly SSA is most likely affecting growth of pop2 ssadh on SSA or GHB (Figure 7B). The results indicate that not the lack of succinate or NADH cause the severe ssadh phenotype, but rather the accumulation of a toxic compound associated with SSA and/ or GHB metabolism, which is associated with high ROI.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0003383.g007. Figure 7. . GHB and GABA contents of pop2, pop2 ssadh and wild type plants grown on either SSA or GHB.. (A) and (C) Relative amounts (highest value is 100%) of gamma-hydroxbutyrate (A; GHB) and gamma-aminobutyrate (C; GABA) in leaves of Col wild type (WT), pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutant plants grown on the indicated concentrations of succinic semialdehyde (SSA). Data (relative arbitrary units normalized to plant weight and the abundance of the internal standard ribitol) were sampled using a GC/MS system, n=4-8 (WT), n=2-8 (pop2) and n=2-8 (pop2 ssadh)SE for GHB and n=4-10 (WT), n=2-10 (pop2) and n=1-8 (pop2 ssadh)SE for GABA. (B) and (D) Relative amounts (highest value is 100%) of GHB (B) and GABA (D) in leaves of Col wild type (WT), pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 mutant plants grown on the indicated concentrations of GHB.

GABA also accumulates in single ssadh-2 mutants [14]. To investigate if high amounts of GABA played a role in causing severe phenotypes of ssadh plants, we measured GABA levels in wild type, pop2-5 and pop2-5 ssadh-2 plants grown on either SSA or GHB. Compared to wild type, leaves of pop2 and pop2 ssadh contained four and five times more GABA, respectively, when grown on medium without SSA (Figure 7C) or GHB (Figure 7D). Thus, disrupting the GABA degradation pathway at the SSADH [14] or the GABA-T step (see also [21]) or both leads to GABA accumulation. The severe phenotypes of ssadh plants have been restored in double pop2 ssadh mutants to wild type levels, implying that higher GABA contents in these mutants are not impairing growth.. In wild type plants grown on different amounts of SSA or GHB, the GABA content did not differ significantly (with the exception of severely affected plants grown on high SSA), implicating that the GABA pool size of the wild type did not respond to SSA or GHB added to the medium. Interestingly, the pop2 mutant accumulated higher amounts of GABA than wild type plants, especially in response to high SSA (0.4 mM and higher; Figure 7A) and high GHB (2.5 mM; Figure 7B). The double pop2 ssadh mutants accumulated enormous amounts of GABA in leaves in response to even moderate amounts of SSA (0.1 mM; Figure 7C) or GHB (0.5 mM; Figure 7D) in the medium. Hence, GABA accumulates much more in pop2 ssadh than in pop2 in response to either SSA or GHB added to the medium..
PMC3198793	Results. . A brca2 double mutant exhibits the same meiotic phenotype as Brca2-inactivated plants. In a previous study, AtBRCA2a and AtBRCA2b expression was inactivated during meiosis by RNAi using an inverted 510 pb-fragment of the BRCA2 cDNA under the control of the meiotic-specific promoter of DMC1 (pDMC1) [39]. In this work, single and double T-DNA insertion mutants for AtBRCA2 were isolated and their phenotype compared to the RNAi-inactivated plants (named pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 ). First, brca2 plants mutated in the AtBRCA2 genes via either a T-DNA insertion located in the 10th intron of AtBRCA2a (in the Cter DNA binding domain) or an insertion in the 4th exon of AtBRCA2b (in the Nter domain of the protein, containing the BRC motifs) were isolated (Figure 1A and Figure 1B). AtBRCA2 transcripts were analysed by RT-PCR, using primers flanking the insertion sites in wild-type and in brca2 single mutant plants. Transcripts of the disrupted genes were not detected in the corresponding mutant lines, whereas transcripts of each AtBRCA2 gene were amplified in wild-type plants. This strongly suggested that the two single brca2 lines were null mutants (Figure 1C). Each single mutant showed normal development and fertility. By crossing the single mutants, the double brca2a brca2b mutant was obtained. These latter plants showed no growth defect and behaved as the wild-type under normal greenhouse conditions. However, they were partially sterile producing very short and mostly empty siliques (Figure 2A). Moreover, the presence of meiotic defects was observed after DAPI staining of the chromosomes in the meiocytes. Indeed, all meiotic figures showed chromosomal entangling without bivalent formation, bridges and fragmentation, leading to chromosomal missegregation (Figure 2B) as previously described for pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 plants. A transgene containing a full length AtBRCA2a cDNA under the control of the promoter of the meiotic recombinase Dmc1 (pDMC1::cDNA AtBRCA2a) was introduced in 13 brac2a brca2b double mutant plants. 11 transformant plants presented a restored phenotype: 9 were completely fertile as demonstrated by the observation of wild-type siliques content and normal meiosis (Figure 2) and 2 were partially fertile (as they presented some siliques that developed as sterile). Only 1 transformant was sterile with developmental defects. As a control, 11 brca2a brca2b double mutant plants were transformed with a transgene containing the pDMC1::RNAi/0 construct, corresponding to the empty vector [39]: all of them were sterile (data not shown). These results reinforce the evidence for the role of AtBRCA2 at meiosis, previously uncovered by our RNAi strategy.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026696.g001. Figure 1. .

Characterization of nhej and ssa mutant plants by RT-PCR and under various genotoxic stress. In order to identify the molecular pathways involved in the aberrant cytological phenotype observed in the Brca2-deficient plants during meiosis, mutant plants deficient in either the NHEJ (ku80-/- and ligIV-/-) or the SSA (ercc1-/-) pathways were characterized. Examining amplification of these transcripts specifically in meiocytes was not possible, as meiocytes would have to be specifically dissected which is technically difficult. However, as shown in Figure 3, all these three genes, and thus the pathways they are involved in, were found expressed in young flower buds, where meiosis takes place, in single as well as in double brca2 mutant plants. Two mutant lines have been previously described: SALK_044027, where the T-DNA insertion is in exon 6 of the AtLIGIV gene [42], [43] and SALK_033397 which contains a T-DNA insertion in exon 3 of AtERCC1 [16]. The absence of transcripts corresponding to the affected gene was confirmed for each mutant line by RT-PCR using primers flanking each T-DNA insertion (data not shown). The ku mutant line used in this study (SALK_112921) had not been characterized to date. It contains a T-DNA in the 6th intron of the AtKU80 gene (Figure 4A). RT-PCR analysis of the 5 and 3 regions flanking the T-DNA insertion revealed the presence of AtKU80 transcripts in both wild-type and ku80 mutant plants (Figure 4B). However, no transcripts could be detected in ku80 mutant plants when primers flanking the T-DNA insertion were used, suggesting that splicing of the 6th intron did not occur in the ku80 mutant. As the insertion site is positioned in the region encoding the domain involved in hetero-dimerization with Ku70, it is most likely that a putative protein, lacking this domain, would be non-functional. Thus, these ku80 plants were considered as functional null mutants. The mutant plants, whatever the affected DNA repair pathway, exhibited no obvious developmental defects under normal growth conditions and were fertile, as previously described for ercc1, ku80 and ligIV Arabidopsis mutants [9], [13], [16].. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026696.g003. Figure 3. . RT-PCR analysis of genes involved in NHEJ and SSA in the single and double brca2 mutants.. RNA was extracted from young floral buds and reverse-transcribed, as described in Figure 1C. Double-stranded cDNAs were PCR-amplified using primer pair 454/455 for AtKU80 (see primer positions in Figure 4 and sequences in Table1), 336/445 for AtLIGIV and 452/453 for AtERCC1 (see Table 1 for sequences). The constitutive ACTIN gene transcript used as a control is presented in Figure 1C.. . . . . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026696.g004. Figure 4. . T-DNA insertion and expression in ku80 mutant.. (A) Position of the T-DNA insertion in AtKU80. The structure of the AtKU80 gene is represented by shaded boxes (exons) and thin lines (introns). The T-DNA insertion position is indicated. Each primer pair used to characterize the mutant by PCR are indicated in black and primer pairs used for RT-PCR analyses are given in red; their localization is correct but not to scale. (B) RT-PCR analysis of AtKU80 transcripts in ku80-/- mutant plants. RNA, extracted from floral buds of wild-type or ku mutant plants was reverse-transcribed. Double-stranded cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR, performed with three different primer pairs: 5 or 3 to the T-DNA and flanking the T-DNA insertion. For primer positions, see above (Figure 4A). The constitutive ACTIN gene was used as a control.. . . . We believed that in the absence of HR during meiosis, the different DNA DSB repair pathways could compensate for each other. Thus, nhej mutant plants, ku80 and ligIV, were crossed with ssa mutant plants, ercc1, and double ku80 ercc1 and ligIV ercc1 mutants affected in both pathways were isolated and genotyped. Both double mutants were viable, presented no obvious developmental defects under normal growth conditions and were fertile.. Sensitivity to various DNA damaging agents is a classical assay to characterize DNA repair mutant plants as most of them show no obvious somatic phenotype. To control that our mutants were indeed affected in DNA repair, their sensitivity to MMS, gamma-ray and UV irradiation was assayed. In comparison to wild-type plants, root growth was affected in the nhej plants as well as in the ssa plants in the presence of MMS or after gamma exposure. Indeed, the MMS hypersensitivity was visible at 50 ppm and gamma-ray hypersensitivity was observed at 100 grays for each single mutant line. However, MMS-induced retarded growth was more pronounced in ercc1 than in ku80 and ligIV plants (Figure 5A). MMS is a methylating agent, and due to the occurrence and clustering of modified bases, it can generate both SSB and DSB, which is reflected in the fact that ercc1 mutants (deficient for both SSA and BER) appeared to be more sensitive to this genotoxic treatment. Reciprocally, ercc1 plants were less sensitive to gamma irradiation when compared to ku80 and ligIV (Figure 5B). Ionising radiations mainly give rise to clustered DNA damages (modified bases and abasic sites) that lead to DNA DSB. Such DNA strand breaks are mostly repaired by NHEJ as suggested by the higher hypersensitivity of ku80 and ligIV mutants to gamma-rays. Finally, as expected, only the ercc1 plants were hypersensitive to UV exposure (Figure 5C). All of these results confirmed that the different mutant Arabidopsis lines were affected in DNA DSB repair.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026696.g005. Figure 5. . Hypersentivity to MMS, gamma-rays and UV irradiation of nhej, ssa and nhej ssa plants.. Before sowing, all seeds were surface-sterilized. (A) MMS hypersensitivity, 11 days post-germination. Seeds were sown on MS 0.5 agar 1% sucrose supplemented with MMS at various doses. (B) Gamma-irradiation hypersentivity, 7 days post-irradiation. After 48 h at 4C in darkness, seeds were exposed to various doses of gamma-rays : 0, 100 and 200 grays before being sown on MS 0.5 agar. (C) UV hypersensitivity, 10 days post-irradiation. Seeds were sown in MS 0.5 agar. After 4 days of growth, the plantlets were exposed to UV-C, left in the dark for 3 days to avoid photoreactivation, and then exposed to light.. . . . MMS and gamma-ray sensitivity of the double nhej ssa mutants were assessed in comparison to the single mutant plants (Figure 5). For each stress, we noted that the sensitivity of the double mutant was similar to that observed for the most affected single mutant: ku80 ercc1 and ligIV ercc1 appeared to be hypersensitive to MMS and UV as was the ercc1 single mutant, whereas they showed a similar hypersensitivity to gamma-rays as the nhej single mutant. Therefore, no cumulative effect was observed.. . . The brca2 meiotic phenotype is maintained during meiosis in nhej and ssa backgrounds. The Brca2 function was inactivated in the nhej and ssa mutant plants by transforming the mutant plants with the previously used pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 construct. As a control, mutant plants were also transformed with a pDMC1::RNAi/0 construct containing no insert [39]. No somatic phenotype was observed in any of the transformed plants containing the empty construct or the pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 construct. When flowers emerged, all plants containing the control construct were fertile, whereas most of the mutant plants transformed with pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 were partially sterile in the single nhej or ssa mutants (between 67 to 80%) as well as in the double nhej ssa mutants (between 60 to 78%), as previously observed for wild-type pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 transformed plants.. The meiotic behaviour was examined after DAPI staining of the chromosomes in the meiocytes of several independent transformed plants that were inactivated for the Brca2 function: 175 meiotic figures from two ku80, 170 meioses from two ligIV and 34 meioses from two ercc1 lines independently transformed with the pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 construct were observed. As a control, they were compared to the meioses of one ku80, one ligIV and one ercc1 plant containing the RNAi/0 construct. All of the observed control plant meiotic figures were normal in the single mutants affected for either NHEJ (ku80, ligIV) or SSA (ercc1), as well as in the nhej ssa double mutant (Supplementary Figure S1). On the other hand, meiosis was profoundly disturbed in meiocytes of these same mutant lines transformed with the pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 construct: chromosomal entangling without bivalent formation, fragmentation, and missegregation of chromosomes (Figure 6). Such observations have been previously reported in wild-type pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 plants [39]. These observations suggested that, contrary to our hypothesis, in the absence of Brca2 during meiosis, neither NHEJ nor SSA were responsible for an alternative meiotic DSB repair that would have been revealed because of the absence of HR [39]. The impact of the inactivation of both pathways in the absence of Brca2 during meiosis was also examined. Meiotic figures from one pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 transformant for ercc1 ku80 (257 meiotic events, among them 80 were post-prophase) and two pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 transformants for ercc1 lig4 (115 meiosis, including 63 post-prophase stages) were observed. In all double mutant plants transformed with pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2, the brca2 meiotic phenotype remained unaltered (Figure 6).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026696.g006. Figure 6. . Observation of meiocytes by DAPI staining in nhej, ssa, nhej ssa and lig6 mutant plants transformed with the pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 construct.. Different stages of meiosis were observed in plants transformed with pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 in nhej mutant plants, ku80 (A-D) or lig4 (E-H), and in ssa mutant plants, ercc1 (I-L), in nhej ssa double mutant plants, ercc1 ku80 (M-P) or ercc1 lig4 (Q-T) and in lig6 mutant plants (U-X).

All of these results suggest that 1) the aberrant chromosomal figures observed in the absence of Brca2 during meiosis are not due to NHEJ or SSA and 2) the other major DNA DSB repair pathways, in the absence of HR, do not compensate for each other during meiosis.. . . DNA Ligases in Arabidopsis. Our initial hypothesis was that the chromosomal bridges detected in the failed anaphases in the absence of Brca2 were due to covalent DNA links, probably between non-homologous chromosomes. Since our data exclude the role of NHEJ and SSA, all DNA ligases apart from LigaseIV (the NHEJ specific enzyme already studied in this work) could be potentially incriminated. The Arabidopsis genome contains three other sequences encoding DNA ligases: AtLigase1 which is involved in replication and Base Excision Repair (BER), AtLigase1a which shares 71% identity with AtLigase1 but for which no transcripts could be detected (our personal data and transcriptome analyses: http://csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/dbxp/ath/ath_xpmgq.html), suggesting that it may be a pseudogene, and AtLigase6, a plant specific ligase that appears to be involved in seed longevity [44]. AtLigase6 has a highly conserved DNA ligase catalytic domain and a beta-lactamase domain containing a beta-CASP motif found in Artemis and other proteins known to play a role in nucleic acid processing [45], [46]}. Since lig1 mutant plants are embryonic lethal [47], [48], we thus examined whether the plant specific AtLigase6 could be involved in the meiotic phenotype of the Brca2-deficient plants.. Homozygous lig6 plants containing a T-DNA insertion in exon 11 of the gene were obtained from the SALK collection (SALK_065307) (Figure 7A). All plants grew normally, they were fertile and undertook normal meioses (data not shown). These observations are in agreement with what was previously observed in a different lig6 insertional line (Waterworth et al, 2010) [44]. RT-PCR analyses detected transcripts on both sides of the T-DNA insertion but no transcripts could be found when primers flanking the T-DNA insertion were used (Figure 7B). As the T-DNA insertion is positioned in an exon, 42 bp from the codon of the catalytic lysine just upstream from the conserved motif II [49] lying in the core domain, and more specifically around the nucleotide binding pocket responsible for the nucleotidyl transfer, the catalytic activity of a putatively expressed protein in this mutant is probably non-functional.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0026696.g007. Figure 7. . T-DNA insertion and expression in lig6 mutant.. (A) Position of the T-DNA insertion in AtLIG6.

(B) RT-PCR analysis of AtLIG6 transcripts in lig6-/- mutant plants. RNA, extracted from floral buds of wild-type or lig6 mutant plants was reverse-transcribed. Double-stranded cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR, performed with three different primer pairs: 5 or 3 to the T-DNAand flanking the T-DNA. The position of each primer is given above (Figure 7A). The constitutive ACTIN gene was used as a control.. . . . . . DNA Ligase6 is not responsible for the brca2 meiotic phenotype. Waterworth et al. (2010) observed a slight but significant growth hypersensitivity of lig6 plants after a 100 gy X-ray irradiation, leading them to suggest that AtLigase6 could play a minor role in the repair of X-ray induced DNA damage. Transformation of our lig6 mutant plants with pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 was performed to inactivate the Brca2 function in lig6 plants. 87% of the transformants (26/30) were partially sterile while lig6 plants or pDMC1::RNAi/0 transformed plants (six transformed plants, 57 meioses observed from two independent transformants) were normally fertile (Supplementary Figure S1). After DAPI staining of the chromosomes in the meiocytes of seven lig6 plants, independently transformed with the pDMC1::RNAi/BRCA2 construct (426 meiotic figures, including 219 post-prophase events), the brca2 meiotic phenotype was consistently observed (Figure 6), thus excluding a role of AtLigase6 in this phenotype..
PMC4292405	Results. . CaM antagonists block the impact of 3OC6-HSL on primary root length. A previous study showed that 3OC6-HSL promotes the primary root elongation of wild-type Arabidopsis (Jin et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012). Root growth is controlled by the cell division in meristem zone and the cell expansion in elongation zone. In order to dissect the promoting effect of 3OC6-HSL on primary root elongation, we measured the length of meristem and elongation zones in primary roots 7 days after application of 3OC6-HSL to Arabidopsis root systems. The results revealed that the primary roots of plants treated with 3OC6-HSL had both longer meristem and elongation zones than those of solvent-treated wild type plants (Figures 1A,D). The difference in the length of elongation zone (30.2%) was much more pronounced than the difference in the length of meristem zone (13.6%). To further pinpoint the process whereby 3OC6-HSL functions, we counted the number and calculated the length of cortical cells in the meristem and elongation zone. We found that treatment with 3OC6-HSL caused a 30% increase in the number of cortical cell in the meristem zone compared to the solvent-treated roots while no significant increase in the length of cortical cells in the meristem zone was observed after 3OC6-HSL treatment, indicating that the increase in meristem size is mainly due to the increased number of cortical cells in root meristem (Figures 1B,C). On the other side, analysis for root elongation zone demonstrated that the elongated root elongation zone induced by 3OC6-HSL contained similar number of cortical cells but longer cells than the control, suggesting an increase in cell expansion (Figures 1E,F). Collectively, these results suggest that 3OC6-HSL promotes primary root growth via changes in cell division and elongation.. . Figure 1. . Effects of 3OC6-HSL on Arabidopsis root meristem zone and root elongation zone. The length of the root meristem zone (A), the number of cortical cells in the meristem zone (B), the length of the root elongation zone (D) and the number of the cortical cells in elongation zone (E) were measured on the wild type seedlings grown on vertically oriented plates containing with or without 1 muM 3OC6-HSL after 7 days of cultivation. The length of cortical cell in the root meristem zone (C) and in the root elongation zone (F) were calculated by dividing the root meristem or elongation zone length by the number of the cortical cells in the root meristem or elongation zone. Data shown are the average of three independent experiments giving the similar statistically siginificant results. Each experiment included at least 20 seedlings. Entries with p-values < 0.05 shown with asterisk.. . . . Previously we demonstrated that Ca2+ signal is involved in AHL signaling in plant cells (Song et al., 2011). To further analyze the role of CaM in AHL-mediated primary root growth, the effects of different concentrations of CaM antagonists, such as trifluoperazine (TFP) and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1- naphthalene-sulphonamide (W-7), on the length of primary roots was first investigated. It was found that the growth of primary roots in the plants only treated with higher concentration W-7 (Figure 2A) or TFP (Figure 2B) was significantly reduced; however, the length of primary roots did not significantly change in the plants treated with 0-50 muM concentration of W-7 (Figure 2A) or with 0-1 muM concentration of TFP (Figure 2B). W-5 is the dechlorinated analog of W-7 and is often used as control compound for understanding the specificity of W-7. The result shows that no deleterious effect on root elongation was observed for W-5 at the tested concentration (Figure 2A). Therefore, 50 muM for W-7 and 1 muM for TFP have been considered as a threshold concentration and chosen for subsequent experiments.. . Figure 2. . Effects of CaM antagonist W-7 and TFP at different concentration on primary root elongation. Wild-type plants were grown on vertically oriented plates containing indicated concentration of W-7, W-5 (no-activity analog of W-7) or TFP and the primary root length was measured after 7 days of cultivation. (A) Plot of a dose-response evaluation of W-7 and W-5 (30-200 muM) on primary root length. (B) Plot of effects of indicated concentration of TFP (1-50 muM) on primary root length. The results were normalized to the root lengths of untreated samples. Data shown are the average of three independent experiments. Each experiment included at least 30 seedlings. Entries with p-values < 0.05 shown with asterisk.. . . . Subsequently, we investigated the effect of 3OC6-HSL on root elongation with or without antagonists. Three-day-old seedlings were transferred to 1/2 MS medium plates containing 1 muM 3OC6-HSL and 50 muM W-7 or 1 muM TFP and cultivated for additional 7 days. The plates containing 50 muM W-5 were taken as control for W-7 treatment. The results showed that the 3OC6-HSL-stimulated primary root growth was completely suppressed by addition of 50 muM W-7 while 50 muM W-5 did not affect the effect of 3OC6-HSL on primary root elongation, indicating that the effect of W-7 was attributable to CaM inhibition (Figure 3). Likewise, 1 muM TFP blocked the increase of primary root length in response to 3OC6-HSL as well (Figure 3). These data suggested that CaM has an important role in AHL-stimulated primary root elongation.. . Figure 3. . Impacts of CaM antagonist W-7 and TFP on the growth-stimulating effect of 3OC6-HSL for primary root elongation. (A) Images of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on vertically oriented plates containing different combination of 3OC6-HSL plus W-7, W-5 or TFP. (B) Plot of effects of CaM antagonists on primary root length in presence of 3OC6-HSL. Wild-type plants were exposed to 3OC6-HSL and CaM antagonists W-7, W-5 (W-7 dechlorinated analog, no antagonist activity) and TFP for 7 d and evaluated for variations in primary root length. The plants grown on the plates without addition of 3OC6-HSL, W-7, W-5, and TFP were taken as the control. 1 muM 3OC6-HSL, 50 muM W-7, 50 muM W-5, and 1 muM TFP were applied into media when necessary. The results were normalized to the root lengths of untreated control. Each value is the average of three independent experiments. Each experiment included at least 30 seedlings. Entries with p-values < 0.05 shown with asterisk.. . . . . . Treatment with 3OC6-HSL promotes the accumulation of the CaM protein. Pharmacological analysis implicates that CaM is required for 3OC6-HSL-mediated primary root elongation (Figure 3). Whether the level of CaM in plant cells is influenced by treatment with 3OC6-HSL has not been resolved. To address this point, we examined the level of CaM protein in Arabidopsis roots reacting to 3OC6-HSL. Total protein was extracted from Arabidopsis roots exposed to 1 muM 3OC6-HSL at different time points and the overall concentration of CaM protein was determined by western blot and ELISA using specific polyclonal antibody against CaM. Western analysis showed that the concentration of CaM protein in roots increased after treatment with 1 muM 3OC6-HSL and reached the maximum at 6 h post treatment (Figure 4A). Similarly, ELISA result indicated that treatment with 1 muM 3OC6-HSL promoted the accumulation of CaM protein and the CaM concentration reached a maximum 2-fold increase after 6 h of treatment with 3OC6-HSL (Figure 4B). These results provide the evidence for a positive regulation of 3OC6-HSL on CaM protein level.. . Figure 4. . Effects of 3OC6-HSL on the accumulation of CaM protein in Arabidopsis roots. The plants were grown in hydroponic Hoagland medium with or without 1 muM 3OC6-HSL. Total protein was extracted from roots at different time interval after 3OC6-HSL treatment. (A) The change of CaM protein level detected by western blot. Actin was used as an internal quantification control. (B) The change of CaM protein level detected by ELISA using polyclonal antibody against wheat CaM. The results were normalized to the CaM protein level of untreated samples. Each value was the average of three independent experiments. Entries with p-values < 0.05 shown with asterisk.. . . . . . 3OC6-HSL induces the expression of all nine CaM isoform genes in Arabidopsis. The results described above demonstrated that 3OC6-HSL increased the CaM protein accumulation, however the response of CaM genes to 3OC6-HSL treatment remains unknown. Therefore, we next investigated the expression profiles of CaM genes after exposure to 3OC6-HSL using qRT-PCR. The Arabidopsis genome contains nine CaM genes encoding CaM protein isoforms (Zielinski, 2002). Since a high nucleic acid sequence conservation exists among nine AtCaM genes, the primers for each AtCaM gene were generally chosen from the 3 untranslated regions of individual AtCaM genes in order to ensure the discrimination between mRNA of genes belonging to highly conserved gene family. Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis roots treated with 1 muM 3OC6-HSL and used to perform the real-time RT-PCR. The expressions of all nine AtCaM genes were up-regulated significantly by 3OC6-HSL although the extent of induction differed from different CaM isoform genes (Figure 5). Compared to the untreated control, a more than 4-fold increase in transcript of AtCaM1, AtCaM3, AtCaM6, and AtCaM8 was observed after treatment with 3OC6-HSL. The mRNA levels of AtCaM4, AtCaM5, AtCaM7, and AtCaM9 genes were increased up to 3-fold by 3OC6-HSL while only 1.7-fold increase was observed in the expression of AtCaM2 in response to 3OC6-HSL treatment (Figure 5). In summary, these data indicated that 3OC6-HSL induced the expression of all nine AtCaM genes with variable degree.. . Figure 5. . Effects of 3OC6-HSL on the expression of CaM genes in Arabidopsis roots. The plants were grown in hydroponic Hoagland medium with or without 1 muM 3OC6-HSL. Total RNA was extracted from roots at different time interval after 3OC6-HSL treatment and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR with specific primers for individual AtCaM gene. Values were normalized to the 0 h time point. Data represent the mean from three independent biological replications. Entries with p-values < 0.05 shown with asterisk. Relative expression of genes (ratio) >1.5 was considered as up-regulation (single asterisk) and ratio < 0.8 was considered as down-regulation (double asterisk).. . . . . . Mutation of individual CaM isoform genes abolish the promotion of primary root length by 3OC6-HSL. The available pharmacological and molecular evidence showed that CaM might be involved in primary root elongation regulated by bacterial AHL, but direct genetic evidence for the participation of CaM is still missing. To solve this question and pursue the specificity of different AtCaM isoform in participation in AHL signaling in plant cells, we compared the primary root elongation in response to 3OC6-HSL between wild-type and the T-DNA insertional mutant lines of individual AtCaM gene. All mutants for all nine AtCaM genes are confirmed to be homozigous lines by antibiotic resistance screening and RT-PCR (Figure 6D) and exhibit no observed phenotypic differences compared with wild-type plants under normal growth conditions (Figure 6A). As shown in Figure 6, the observed increased root elongation upon 3OC6-HSL exposure in wild-type plant was impaired in all mutation lines of nine AtCaM genes. The length of primary roots in cam1, cam2, cam4, cam5, cam6, cam7, and cam9 after treatment with 3OC6-HSL was similar to that of untreated plants of respective mutants (Figures 6A,B). The primary root in cam3 and cam8 after contact to 3OC6-HSL exhibited even slightly shorter than that of untreated respective mutants, however no significant difference was found between treatment and untreatment with 3OC6-HSL after statistical analysis (Figure 6B). Additionaly, we measured the effects of 3OC6-HSL on the fresh weight of seedlings of wild-type and the individual AtCaM mutants. An obvious increase in the fresh weight of wild type seedlings was observed after treatment with 3OC6-HSL, whereas the fresh weight of seedlings of all nine AtCaM mutants was similar between treated and untreated plants (Figure 6C). Although the conclusion for role of AtCaM in AHL signaling at genetic level needs to be reinforced by complementary and over-expression analysis, our data provide preliminary evidence that all nine AtCaM genes might be involved in plant response to 3OC6-HSL with respect to primary root elongation.. . Figure 6. . The stimulating effect of 3OC6-HSL on primary root elongation is diminished in loss-of-function mutants of individual AtCaM genes. (A) Images of Arabidopsis wild-type plants and CaM functional-deficiency mutants cam1, cam2, cam3, cam4, cam5, cam6, cam7, cam8, and cam9 grown side by side on vertically oriented plates containing with or without 1 muM 3OC6-HSL after 7 days of cultivation.

Data shown are the average of four independent experiments. Entries with p-values < 0.05 shown with asterisk. (D) Identification of CaM null mutants by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the leaves of one-month-old wild type (Columbia, Col-0) and CaM mutants (cam1-cam9) seedlings and RT-PCR were done to amplify CaM1, CaM2, CaM3, CaM4, CaM5, CaM6, CaM7, CaM8, and CaM9 genes both from wild type RNA and from corresponding CaM mutant RNA. Actin was used as the endogenous reference gene.. . . . It has been reported that short-side chain AHLs such as C6-HSL and 3OC6-HSL promoted primary root elongation (von Rad et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012) while long-side chain AHLs (10-16 carbons) such as C10-HSL and C12-HSL inhibited primary root growth but promoted the formation of lateral root and root hair (Ortiz-Castro et al., 2008, 2011). To investigate if the inhibitory effects of C10-HSL and C12-HSL on primary root elongation, we compared the primary root length between wild-type and the T-DNA insertional mutants of nine AtCaM genes after exposure to C10-HSL and C12-HSL. The results indicated that while C10-HSL or C12-HSL inhibited the primary root growth but promoted the lateral root and root hair development of wild type plants at concentration of 50 muM, the responses of the mutants of nine AtCaM genes to C10-HSL or C12-HSL were similar as that of wild type plants with respect to the root architecture (Figure 7). These data suggested that AtCaMs might not participated in the regulation of root growth and development by the long-chain AHLs.. . Figure 7. .

PMC3044220	Results. . AXL1 catalyzes thioester formation between ECR1 and RUB1 in vitro. Sequence similarity between AXR1 and AXL1 suggests that AXL1 has the same, or similar, biochemical activity to AXR1 (Dharmasiri et al. 2007). Previous in vitro assays show AXR1 to catalyze formation of a thioester linkage between the C-terminus of RUB1 and the catalytic cysteine, C215, of ECR1 (del Pozo et al. 1998). However, the biochemical activity of AXL1 has not been demonstrated directly. Utilizing an in vitro thioester assay, we show RUB1-ECR1 thioester formation is also catalyzed by AXL1 (Fig.1). Recombinant GST-ECR1 and 6HIS-3HA-RUB1 were incubated with 6HIS-AXL1 or 6HIS-AXR1, in the presence of ATP. Each reaction was then split: one-half was added to stop buffer lacking dithiothreitol (Fig.1, -DTT, upper panel), and the other half was added to stop buffer containing DTT (Fig.1, +DTT, lower panel). Thioester linkages are reduced by DTT, while oxyester and amide linkages are resistant to DTT-mediated cleavage. After separation by SDS-PAGE, conjugated 6HIS-3HA-RUB1 was visualized by anti-HA immunoblot analysis. In these experiments unconjugated 6HIS-3HA-RUB1 is 17kDa in size and is not present on the blots. GST-ECR1 alone migrates at 72kDa (Fig.1, left panel, alphaGST). An anti-HA band migrating approximately 20kDa larger than GST-ECR1 was visible in complete reactions containing either 6HIS-AXR1 or 6HIS-AXL1 and stopped in the absence of DTT (Fig.1, lanes 1 and 2, compare -DTT and +DTT), indicative of a RUB1-ECR1 thioester conjugate. GST-ECR1 and 6HIS-3HA-RUB1, in reactions lacking 6HIS-AXR1 and 6HIS-AXL1, were insufficient to support RUB1-ECR1 thioester formation (Fig.1, lane 3). No slow-migrating HA-immunoreactive protein was visible when either GST-ECR1 or 6HIS-3HA-RUB1 was omitted from reactions containing 6HIS-AXR1 or 6HIS-AXL1 (Fig.1, lanes 4-7). Thus, AXL1 is required for conjugation of RUB1 to ECR1 in an in vitro thioester reaction, as seen for AXR1 under the same conditions.Fig.1AXL1 catalyzes RUB1-ECR1 thioester formation like AXR1. In vitro thioester assays with recombinant 6HIS-AXR1, 6HIS-AXL1, GST-ECR1, and 6HIS-3HA-RUB1 are shown. An anti-GST blot of purified GST-ECR1 at 72kDa is included for reference. Anti-HA immunoblot analysis detected 3HA-RUB1-GST-ECR1 thioester formation under non-reducing conditions (-DTT) only, catalyzed by 6HIS-AXR1 (lane 1), or by 6HIS-AXL1 (lane 2). Lanes 3-7 for both upper and lower panels show reactions lacking 6HIS-AXL1 and 6HIS-AXR1 (lane 3), GST-ECR1 (lanes 4 and 5), or 6HIS-3HA-RUB1 (lanes 6 and 7), as negative controls. All reactions were stopped under non-reducing (-DTT, upper panel) or reducing (+DTT, lower panel) conditions and separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. White spaces represent positions where unnecessary lanes were removed, or where lanes were moved for alignment purposes. Size markers are in kDa. Additionally, enzyme specificity for RUB1 over UBQ was examined for AXL1 in comparison to AXR1. 6HIS-AXR1 and 6HIS-AXL1 again supported 6HIS-3HA-RUB1 thioester formation to GST-ECR1, but neither was able to support HA-UBQ attachment to GST-ECR1, while the same HA-UBQ formed an UBQ-E1 thioester conjugate (Online Resource 1). In conclusion, AXL1 and AXR1 support RUB1, but not UBQ, thioester formation, demonstrating that AXL1 has biochemical activity and specificity similar to AXR1.. . . AXL1 and AXR1 have similar biochemical activities in vitro. While having the same selectivity for RUB1, it is possible that AXR1 and AXL1 differ subtly in ability to catalyze RUB1-ECR1 thioester formation. To further examine the biochemical activities of AXR1 and AXL1 we set up an in vitro time course assay to compare the ability of each enzyme to catalyze covalent attachment of RUB1 to ECR1. Here we utilized ECR1C215S that carries a cysteine to serine mutation at the active site, in order to stabilize the bond for visualization purposes. Recombinant 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215S and GST-3HA-RUB1 were incubated with either 6HIS-AXL1 or 6HIS-AXR1 for 1, 2, or 4h. At each time point, reaction aliquots were split and both halves were subjected to anti-HA-agarose immunoprecipitation to capture GST-3HA-RUB1 and interacting proteins.. One-half of each reaction was kept under neutral conditions to maintain the RUB1-ECR1C215S oxyester bond (Fig.2a, alphaHA IP, even-numbered lanes), while the other half reaction was treated with base to destroy the oxyester bond (data not shown) to demonstrate the nature of the RUB1-ECR1 linkage. In addition, parallel reactions were done with ECR1C215A [described in (del Pozo et al. 1998)] that carries a cysteine to alanine mutation at the active site (Fig.2a, alphaHA IP, odd-numbered lanes). This protein should not support covalent RUB attachment, and it serves to verify the specificity of the reaction. Presence of 6HIS-AXL1, 6HIS-AXR1, 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215S, and 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215A in the reactions was verified by anti-HIS immunoblot analysis (Fig.2a, Input). To visualize the RUB1-ECR1 oxyester bond, anti-FLAG immunoblots were done (Fig.2a, alphaHA IP). Only reactions that included 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215S, not 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215A, supported RUB1-ECR1 oxyester bond formation.Fig.2AXL1 and AXR1 have similar biochemical activities in vitro. a Time course for various oxyester assays with recombinant 6HIS-AXR1, 6HIS-AXL1, 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215S, 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215A, and GST-3HA-RUB1. After anti-HA immunoprecipitation, anti-FLAG immunoblot analysis was used to detect GST-3HA-RUB1-6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215S oxyester formation, catalyzed by 6HIS-AXL1 (lanes 2, 6, 10), or by 6HIS-AXR1 (lanes 4, 8, 12), for various lengths of time. As a negative control, parallel reactions were done with the catalytic mutant 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215A and 6HIS-AXL1 (lanes 1, 5, 9) or 6HIS-AXR1 (lanes 3, 7, 11). Input (fraction of total for each sample, removed prior to start of time course) was checked with anti-HIS immunoblot to verify addition of 6HIS-AXL1, 6HIS-AXR1, 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215S, and 6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215A. Size markers are in kDa. b GST-3HA-RUB1-6HIS-FLAG-ECR1C215S band intensity plotted against time, comparing catalytic activity of 6HIS-AXL1 (circles) and 6HIS-AXR1 (triangles) for n=4 replicates. Regression lines for 6HIS-AXL1 (light gray) and 6HIS-AXR1 (dark gray) are included. At alpha=0.05, testing for an E1*time interaction is not significant (factorial ANOVA, P=0.0755). To compare relative activities of 6HIS-AXL1 and 6HIS-AXR1, immunoblots were quantified and RUB1- ECR1C215S bond formation was plotted against time (Fig.2b). Regression line slopes for ECR1C215S reactions containing 6HIS-AXR1 or 6HIS-AXL were not statistically different (factorial ANOVA, P=0.0755). The marginal P-value does not exclude the possibility that a subtle difference in catalytic abilities might exist between AXR1 and AXL1, but a more precise assay would be required to discern such a difference. In this assay, we could not detect a difference between AXR1 and AXL1 in ability to support RUB1-ECR1C215S bond formation over time.. . . AXR1 and AXL1 interact with RUB1 in vivo. To assess whether AXL1 functions in native RUB E1 complexes, we used a mass spectrometry (MS) approach. Transgenic plant lines that express 3HA-RUB1 under control of an inducible promoter were utilized [described in (Bostick et al. 2004)] and protein extracts were made from seedlings induced for 3HA-RUB1 expression. Proteins that interact with 3HA-RUB1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA-agarose beads, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by high-accuracy MS. Results were compiled from five biological replicates; recovered peptides were compared between Columbia expressing 3HA-RUB1 and wild-type Columbia, prepared in parallel. Table1 combines data from replicates where peptide and protein standards were met, specifically a minimum 95% peptide probability, using the Peptide Prophet algorithm, and protein probability of minimally 95% with 2 unique peptides, using the Protein Prophet algorithm (Keller et al. 2002; Nesvizhskii et al. 2003). Peptides were identified from AXR1, AXL1, and other known RUB-conjugation components, including RUB1, ECR1, RCE1, CUL1, and CUL4. These results suggest that AXL1, as found naturally in cells, interacts with 3HA-RUB1, despite the presence of AXR1, suggesting that AXL1 forms functional E1 complexes in vivo and is active concurrent with AXR1.Table1RUB conjugation components recovered by LC-MS/MS analysis of 3HA-RUB1 immunoprecipitationsGeneUniprot IDAGIMass (Da)Unique peptidesaTotal unique hitsProtein ID probabilityb (%)% CoveragecAXL1Q9ZV69At2g3241057924.1126310033AXR1P42744At1g0518060018.12021210056CUL1Q94AH6 B9DGE3At4g0257086287.471110012CUL4Q8LGH4At5g4621091457.7351005ECR1O65041At5g1918050524.41826410048RCE1Q9SDY5At4g3680020768.944510028RUB1Q9SHE7At1g313408872.8346010050aPeptides are designated as unique if they differ in primary amino acid sequence and satisfy rules of parsimonybProtein ID probability is for the highest probability observed in 5 biological replicatesc% coverage is cumulative for 5 biological replicates.

AXL1 and AXR1 proteins accumulate to similar levels when expressed exogenously in axr1-30 under the same promoter. Loss-of-function mutations in AXR1 result in a well-described phenotype; adult plants are dwarfed and show reduced apical dominance, leaf curling and reduced fertility; axr1 seedlings are also less sensitive to exogenous auxin (Lincoln et al. 1990; Leyser et al. 1993). Loss-of-function mutation in AXL1 has little or no phenotypic effect in plants that carry two AXR1 wild-type alleles, but in plants that carry a mutation in one or both AXR1 alleles, the effect of axl1 is synergistic (Dharmasiri et al. 2007). A simple explanation for the differential contribution of each gene could be differences in transcript expression, as mRNA levels of AXL1 are lower than AXR1 (Dharmasiri et al. 2007).. To examine the biochemical and functional equivalence of AXR1 and AXL1 in vivo, expression cassettes for the respective coding sequences, under the control of the same 5 flanking region, were introduced into axr1-30, a severe AXR1 mutant [phenotypically characterized in (Gilkerson et al. 2009)] that is similar in phenotype to axr1-12, a well-characterized severe allele (Lincoln et al. 1990; Leyser et al. 1993). axr1-30 does not produce detectable authentic mRNA and thus appears to be a loss-of-function allele. Additionally, loss of AXR1 does not affect the expression of AXL1 (Online Resource 4). The expression cassettes contain the 5 intergenic region for AXR1, hereafter referred to as the AXR1 promoter (AXR1p), sequence for an N-terminal 10xMYC epitope tag, and the respective coding sequence. These constructs were introduced into AXR1/axr1-30 plants and then plants were brought to homozygosity for both the axr1-30 allele and the respective transgene.. To make comparisons, 10MYC-AXR1 and 10MYC-AXL1 protein levels were examined in all AXR1p:10MYC-AXR1 (called AXR1 lines) and AXR1p:10MYC-AXL1 (called AXL lines) transgenic lines. 10MYC-AXL1 protein levels were found to be similar to or exceeding 10MYC-AXR1 protein levels (Fig.3a and data not shown). As elucidated by crystal structures for the human equivalent of RUB E1, the N-terminal RUB E1 subunit provides structural support and binding surfaces for RUB and ATP, in complex with ECR1 that houses the active catalytic cysteine and adenylation domains (Walden et al. 2003a; Walden et al. 2003b). Both 10MYC-AXR1 and 10MYC-AXL1 maintain the ability to interact with 6HIS-3HA-RUB1, when co-expressed transiently in tobacco, confirming functionality of these epitope-tagged proteins (Online Resource 5).Fig.3Protein levels for AXR1 and AXL1 are similar in axr1-30 transgenic lines, but only AXR1 line 1 shows moderate correction of axr1-30 phenotype in seedlings. a Protein levels in 8-day old seedlings. Based on anti-MYC immunoblot analyses, 10MYC-AXL1 (lanes 1-4) and 10MYC-AXR1 (lanes 5 and 6) accumulate protein to similar levels above background (lane 7), in characterized axr1-30 transgenic lines. 150 mug total protein was loaded for all samples. b Root length in 9-day old seedlings. Transgenic lines were plated on GM agar and grown for 9days with germination marked on day 2. On day 9, seedlings were removed from plates, photographed, and root length was measured. Students t-tests with Bonferonni adjustment (alpha=0.00385) were performed on combined data from three replicates. Plant lines marked with an asterisk are significantly different from axr1-30. Error bars represent SE with minimally n=41 measurements per line. . . AXR1 corrects axr1-30 phenotypic defects more than AXL1 throughout development. After recovering homozygous axr1-30 lines that were also homozygous for either the AXR1p:10MYC-AXR1 (AXR1 lines) or AXR1p:10MYC-AXL1 (AXL lines) expression cassette, we sought to measure the effect of transgene expression by comparing growth of transgenic lines to axr1-30 and wild-type Columbia. Surprisingly, AXR1p:10MYC-AXR1 and AXR1p:10MYC-AXL1 expression cassettes differentially corrected axr1-30 phenotypic defects. Of five AXR1 lines analyzed, all showed moderate to strong complementation of axr1-30 phenotypic defects in adult plants. In contrast, of nine AXL lines analyzed, none showed strong complementation of axr1-30 phenotypic defects. Four AXL lines were then characterized in detail and compared to two AXR1 lines. For each set of phenotypic observations (i.e. root length, response to auxin, rosette diameter, and inflorescence height), Students t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons were performed to compare all lines to axr1-30 and wild type (Columbia). Additional statistical tests were then done to make comparisons among those lines that had phenotypes intermediate between axr1-30 and Columbia.. First, root length and response to the synthetic auxin, 2,4-D, were measured in 9-day old seedlings. axr1-30 roots, averaging 20.3mm in length, are significantly longer than Columbia roots, which average 11.8mm (Fig.3b and Online Resource 6). Most lines are not significantly different from axr1-30, with only AXR1 line 1 that averages 16.8mm showing a phenotype intermediate between axr1-30 and Columbia (Fig.3b and Online Resource 6). Of the two AXR1 lines, line 1 expresses more 10MYC-AXR1 (Fig.3a). Unexpectedly, AXL line 4 with average length of 23.3mm is significantly longer than axr1-30, suggesting a potential ectopic phenotype, resulting from transgene over-expression or site of transgene insertion (Fig.3b and Online Resource 6). When auxin responsiveness of seedling roots is measured, axr1-30 is auxin resistant whereas Columbia is auxin sensitive. The roots of AXL and AXR1 lines are auxin resistant, and thus they remain like axr1-30 regarding this phenotype (Online Resources 7, 8).. Next, rosette diameter at four weeks was measured and statistical analyses were performed. axr1-30 plants are dwarfed with small leaves; their rosette diameter is 45% that of Columbia at the same age (Fig.4a). At this point in development, correction of the axr1-30 phenotype is readily apparent for AXR1 lines, but is not for AXL lines. The average rosette diameters for AXL line 1 and AXR1 lines 1 and 2 are 4.0cm, 5.9cm, and 4.0cm, respectively, statistically larger than for axr1-30, which averages 3.4cm in diameter. However, none are equivalent to Columbia, which averages 7.5cm in diameter (Fig.4a and Online Resources 9, 10). Of these three lines that are significantly larger than axr1-30, AXR1 line 1 is significantly larger than the other two (P<0.0001), and AXL line 1 and AXR1 line 2 are indistinguishable (P=0.7165), utilizing a Students t-test with Bonferroni correction and alpha=0.00313. At four weeks, AXL line 1 is the only AXL line that is significantly larger than axr1-30, whereas both AXR1 lines are distinguishable from axr1-30.Fig.4AXR1 corrects axr1-30 adult phenotypic defects more than AXL1. a Rosette diameter measurements on 28-day old plants. Transgenic lines were grown for 28days, then each was photographed and diameter was measured. Students t-tests with Bonferonni adjustment (alpha=0.00313) were performed on log-transformed data combined from two replicates. Plant lines marked with an asterisk are significantly different from axr1-30. Error bars represent SE with minimally n=29 measurements per line. b Inflorescence height measurements on 70-day old plants. Transgenic lines were grown for 70days and height was measured. Students t-tests with Bonferonni adjustment (alpha=0.00313) were performed on log-transformed data combined from two replicates. Plant lines marked with an asterisk are significantly different from axr1-30. Error bars represent SE with minimally n=24 measurements per line. Finally, inflorescence height at ten weeks was measured for all lines. Here the difference in ability to restore the phenotype to Columbia between AXR1 and AXL1 expression is most apparent. Both AXR1 lines show good restoration of height, averaging 45.8cm and 37.3cm, compared to axr1-30 and Columbia, which average 25.2cm and 52.1cm, respectively (Figs.4b, 5). Of the AXL lines, only line 1 that averages 29.3cm in height shows a moderate correction of axr1-30 height. Statistical analyses confirm that AXL line 1, AXR1 line 1, and AXR1 line 2 are significantly taller than axr1-30, though none are the same height as Columbia (Figs.4b, 5 and Online Resource 11). Both AXR1 lines (P<0.0001) are significantly taller than AXL line 1, and AXR line 1 is taller than AXR1 line 2 (P<0.0001), using a Students t-test with Bonferroni correction and alpha=0.00313.Fig.5At day 70 post-plating, AXR1 corrects the inflorescence height defect of axr1-30 more than AXL1. AXR1 and AXL lines were grown for 70days and height was measured. Representative pictures of AXL lines (a-d), AXR1 lines (e-f), axr1-30 (g), and Columbia (h) are shown. Scale bar represents 5cm. In summary, we show that the in vivo functions of AXR1 and AXL1 are not equal. When AXL1 is expressed at a similar or higher level than AXR1, AXL1 does not have equivalent ability to correct axr1-30 phenotypic defects, suggesting that the two proteins differ in function at either the biochemical level, or with preference for downstream interacting partners..
PMC3002950	Results. Here, we propose a novel robustness analysis that aims to determine the common robustness of the model with multiple, biologically plausible parameter sets, rather than the local robustness for a particular parameter set. Our method is applied to two published models of the Arabidopsis circadian clock (the one-loop [1] and two-loop [2] models). The results reinforce current findings suggesting the greater reliability of the two-loop model and pinpoint the crucial role of TOC1 in the circadian network..
PMC4252027	Results. . Metabolic effects of the sugar treatments in different conditions. The biological material used and the experiments performed in this. study are summarized in Figure1. Sucrose. treatments were applied to Arabidopsis seedlings both in the dark and in the light. in order to uncouple the effects of sucrose and light on translation. To adjust. for osmotic changes of the media control samples were treated with equimolar. concentrations of sorbitol. Metabolite changes induced in the seedlings under the. different conditions were analyzed using GC-MS (Table1, Additional file 1:. Table S1). By comparing data obtained for seedlings treated with sorbitol. (control) in the dark and in the light, we could conclude that dark control. treatment did not induce carbon starvation in our conditions, as sucrose and. hexose levels were not significantly affected, similar to most of the identified. metabolites. Interestingly, some of the metabolite levels showed a significantly. different response to sucrose treatment in the light and in the dark. The levels. of amino acids glycine and glutamine increased in the light but not in the dark,. while valine and isoleucine decreased in the dark but not in the light.. Furthermore, the sucrose-induced increase in hexose and hexose-phosphate levels. was stronger in the light. While the organic acids malic acid and citric acid. accumulated more in the light than in the dark, succinic acid showed higher levels. in the dark. Glycerol-3-phosphate showed reduced levels in the light but not in. the dark. This indicates that the sucrose treatment affected metabolism. differently in the dark than in the light condition.Figure 1.

Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, p < 0.05).. . . Sucrose treatments affect transcription differentially in the light than in. the dark. Differences in transcript levels induced under the different. conditions were studied using microarray analysis (Additional file 2: Table S2). When comparing the sorbitol treated. controls, it became apparent that the dark treatment alone affected only few genes. (358) in their steady-state level (p<0.05, more than 2 fold change). 99 of. these genes were up-regulated and GO terms related to response to sugar stimuli. were found enriched. No genes related to stress response or starvation were. induced by the dark control treatment providing further evidence that this. treatment does not induce starvation. Among the 259 down-regulated genes, enriched. GO terms were related to starch metabolism and the chloroplast, indicating that. reduced polysaccharide synthesis and the remobilization of stored reserves might. prevent starvation during the dark treatment.. Sugar treatment induced substantial transcriptional changes in both. light and dark. In seedlings treated with sucrose under light condition, the. steady state mRNA level of 2225 genes was significantly (p<0.05, more than 2. fold change) changed, with 947 genes up- and 1278 down-regulated compared to the. light control treatment. In seedlings treated with sucrose under dark condition,. the expression of 2981 genes was significantly changed, with 1474 genes up- and. 1506 down-regulated compared to the dark control. Of the sugar-controlled genes,. 967 responded only in the light, and 1728 only in the dark condition, and 1257. were significantly changed in both (Figure2A, Additional file 3:. Figure S1 and Additional file 4: Figure. S2 for more comparisons).Figure 2. Transcripts affected by sucrose treatment in. Arabidopsis seedlings in the light and in the dark.

B) Selected mapman. categories of genes up- or down-regulated after sucrose treatment in the. light or in the dark.

Repressed by sucrose in. the light: GO:0015979: photosynthesis (p<1e-30), GO:0006098:. pentose-phosphate shunt (2.2e-20), GO:0019252: starch biosynthetic process. (4.7e-11), GO:0000023: maltose metabolic process (5.1e-11). Repressed by. sucrose in the dark: GO:0015979: photosynthesis (<1e-30), GO:0006098:. pentose-phosphate shunt (1.3e-20), GO:0019252: starch biosynthetic process. (6.4e-18),GO:0005984: disaccharide metabolic process (6.5e-10). Induced by. sucrose in the light: GO:0006412: translation (2.0e-16), GO:0042254:. ribosome biogenesis (6.9e-28), GO:0001510: RNA methylation (<1e-30).. Induced by sucrose in the dark: e.g. GO:0010200: response to chitin. (<1e-30), GO:0000165: MAPK cascade (<1e-30), GO:0009408: response to. heat (<1e-30), GO:0009611: response to wounding (<1e-30),. GO:0009723: response to ethylene stimulus (<1e-30).. The changes observed for steady-state mRNA levels in the different. conditions were compared with the measured metabolic changes (Additional file. 5: Figure S3). However, no clear. pattern was observed that could connect the alterations on the two cellular. levels, consistent with studies showing a predominant regulation of metabolism on. the post-transcriptional level [35].. GO term enrichment analysis was used to identify significantly. enriched functions among the genes affected in the different conditions. (Figure2B). More genes linked to stress. and signaling were up-regulated by sucrose treatment in the dark, while genes. expressing cytosolic ribosomal proteins were mostly up-regulated in the light.. Categories those were down-regulated both in the light and in the dark contained. genes involved in photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism.. Using the PlantGSEA toolkit for gene set enrichment analysis. [36], we found an overlap between. previously generated datasets and our microarray results (Additional file. 6: Table S3). Genes up-regulated by. sucrose treatment [37], carbon. fixation [38] or repressed by the. KIN10 subunit of SnRK1 [39]. overlapped significantly with the list of genes induced by sucrose both in dark. and in light in our study. Inversely, genes down-regulated by sucrose treatment in. both conditions of our study are to a great extend also repressed by sucrose in. another study [37], by carbon. fixation [38] or are identified as. positively affected by KIN10 [39].. While sucrose-repressed genes showed a great overlap between the. dark and the light condition, bigger differences between light and dark were. observed for the genes induced by sucrose (Additional file 3: Figure S1 and Additional file 4: Figure S2). In the dark, but not in the light,. the sucrose-induced genes overlapped significantly with those found induced by. biotic stress response [40,41], in agreement. with the enrichment of GO terms linked to stress response and signaling among. these genes.. . . Sucrose induced translational changes are different in the light and in the. dark. In order to study to what extent the changes in steady-state mRNA. levels are linked to changes in translation of the mRNAs, sucrose density gradient. fractionation was performed. General translational activity can be estimated from. this data by analyzing the area under the curve in the polysomal fractions. (Figure3A). In the light control. samples, 425% of the total area was in the polysome fraction. This value. dropped to 376% in the dark-treated control, while sucrose treatment. significantly increased the percentage of polysomal RNA areas to 556% in the. light and 475% in the dark, which corresponds to a difference to the control of. 124% and 116%, respectively (Figure3B).Figure 3. Effects of sucrose treatment on general and specific. translation in the light and in the dark. A) Absorbance. profile of sucrose density gradients.

E) Plot showing the polysomal occupancy. vs. transcriptional changes induced by sucrose in the light compared to. the control. Red dots mark genes with significantly differential ribosomal. occupancy.. In order to analyze the mRNA content by microarray, the polysomal. fraction were separated from the non-polysomal fraction (Figure3A). The polysomal fraction was separated into small. and large polysomes, and the mRNA extracted from these fractions was analyzed by. microarray analysis. Unexpectedly, an around 90% overlap was observed between the. lists of genes affected in the small or large polysome fractions after sucrose. treatment. Therefore, the results obtained for the small polysome fractions are. discussed here as polysomal mRNA levels in order to simplify the analysis.. Comparing the polysomal mRNA levels with changes of steady-state levels allowed. identifying alterations in polysomal occupancy, representing the ratio of. polysomal mRNA levels to steady-state mRNA levels under the different conditions.. The lists obtained for genes altered in their polysomal occupancy in small and. large polysomes were fused, as only 4 genes were specific for the large polysomal. fraction.. Following sucrose treatment, most mRNAs showed similar changes in. steady-state and in polysomal mRNA levels (Figure3C, Additional file 3:. Figure S1 and Additional file 4: Figure. S2). Interestingly, polysomal occupancy was changed for a number of genes. We. identified 243 genes with altered polysomal occupancy following sucrose treatment. in the light and 12 genes affected by sucrose treatment in the dark, with 7 genes. found under both conditions. The dark control treatment (compared to the sorbitol. light control) affected the polysomal mRNA levels of few genes and none of which. was significantly affected in polysomal occupancy in our experimental conditions. (Figure3D).. Sucrose treatment induced the differential polysomal occupancy of. 243 mRNAs in the light. Most of these mRNAs were relatively poorly translated in. control conditions, whereas sucrose treatment promoted their polysomal mRNA. levels. Interestingly, 238 of the 243 genes were detectable in the control samples. of a recently published dataset obtained by ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis. seedlings [15], indicating that the. genes are translated also in general conditions. For these genes, the. translational efficiency under control conditions (1% sucrose) was markedly lower. than the average of the whole dataset, indicating that these genes might be. translated less than average. Furthermore, only for 31 out of the 243 transcripts. the sugar treatment altered steady-state transcript levels significantly. (Figure3E).. A significant higher number, than expected from random distribution. of the 243 genes, changed in polysomal occupancy following sucrose treatment in. the light could be associated to GO terms related to vesicle-mediated transport,. protein degradation, and ribosomal proteins (Additional file 7: Figure S4).. Sucrose treatment in the light affected both steady-state. transcript levels and polysome association of ribosomal protein mRNAs. On the. microarray, 228 out of the 240 genes encoding ribosomal proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana were represented, including. RACK1, but excluding identified pseudogenes.. Of these, steady-state levels of 199 mRNAs were significantly affected, with 44. mRNAs showing an over 2-fold response. Interestingly, the sucrose effect on. polysomal mRNA levels of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins was more pronounced,. with 212 mRNAs significantly affected and an over two-fold change of 116 mRNAs. (Additional file 8: Table S4). The. ribosomal protein mRNAs significantly affected in their polysomal occupancy belong. to 13 of the 81 ribosomal protein gene families. Next to the mRNAs affected in. polysomal occupancy, paralogs of all gene families were affected in their. steady-state transcription or their polysomal mRNA levels. The RPL18a family, for. example, had two paralogs (L18aA and B) not significantly affected in steady-state. levels or polysome association, one paralog (L18aD) affected in both, and one. paralog (L18aC) affected in polysomal occupancy (Figure4). For the latter, polysomal mRNA levels were significantly. affected, whereas the steady-state mRNA levels remained unaltered. The RPL18a. family thus served as an example of different possible regulatory effects that. were observed for the different members of a ribosomal protein family.Figure 4. Effects of sucrose treatments on mRNA abundance and. polysomal mRNA levels of the. RPL18a. family. Effects of sucrose treatment in. the light on steady-state mRNA abundance (light grey) and polysomal mRNA. levels (dark grey) of members of the ribosomal protein family RPL18a. Bars. show the averages of three biological replicates of log2 fold changes. obtained by microarray analysisSD. Asterisks mark significant changes. in transcript abundance (p<0.05, log2 fold change. >1).. Interestingly, after sucrose treatment in the dark, 123 ribosomal. protein mRNA steady-state levels changed significantly, with 7 mRNAs showing an. over two-fold change. Furthermore, 153 mRNAs showed significant changes in. polysome association, but only 3 mRNAs showed an over two-fold change. None of the. ribosomal protein genes was significantly affected in its polysomal occupancy. (Additional file 8: Table S4).. . . Ribosome density is decreased after sucrose treatment. The distribution of mRNAs between non-polysomal and polysomal. fraction was investigated by real time qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from. sucrose density gradient fractions without prior sucrose cushion enrichment. In. this way, the total mRNA complement could be studied, including the mRNAs not. associated to ribosomes that are removed by the sucrose cushion enrichment. Such. experiments allow for the polysomal mRNA levels to be expressed as percentage of. total mRNA. Polysomal mRNA association was analyzed for 10 different genes and. using a spiked-in luciferase mRNA control for normalization. This experiment. confirmed the pattern of polysomal mRNA levels observed in microarray analysis for. 5 mRNAs with increased polysomal occupancy (Figure5A) and 5 with no significant changes in occupancy, as well as. the distribution of 18S rRNA (Additional file 9: Figure S5). In this way, the increased polysomal occupancy of. mRNAs encoding RPS12A (At1g15930) and RPL18aC (At3g14600) was confirmed, which. rose from approx. 30-40% in the control to >80% in the sucrose treated samples. (Figure5A). A similar pattern was. observed for an RNA binding protein (At1g73530), but not for a cytochrome P450. family member (At4g39510) as negative control, confirming results obtained in the. microarray analysis.Figure 5. Real-time qRT-PCR confirmation of the results. obtained by microarray analysis for samples treated with sucrose in the. light. A) Comparison of the RNA distribution in non-polysomal.

Shown are averages of three independent. biological replicatesSD, expression values normalized on LUC spike and. on the total area under the curve in the corresponding polysomal gradient. analysis.. Furthermore, dynamics of the transcripts within the polysomal. fraction was studied using real time qRT-PCR analysis of 12 gradient fractions. collected from sucrose density gradients loaded with sucrose cushion-enriched. samples. Primers for 18S rRNA were used to confirm similar distribution of rRNA in. control and sucrose-treated samples after normalization with spiked-in LUC mRNA. and the area under the respective curves in the sucrose density gradients. (Figure5B, Additional file 9: Figure S5). Interestingly, the mRNA peaks. observed after sucrose treatment appear in a fraction of lower density compared to. the control, while a shift to higher density could have been expected considering. the increase in polysomal occupancy. Apparently, fewer ribosomes were loaded on a. larger fraction of the mRNAs after sucrose treatment. No difference in polysomal. occupancy or ribosome density was detected for the cytochrome P450 mRNA. (At4g39510) used as negative control.. . . Bioinformatic analysis reveals specific characteristics of translationally. controlled mRNAs. Bioinformatic analysis showed mRNA characteristics significantly. different in the group of translationally regulated mRNAs compared to the. microarray background. The sucrose-regulated mRNAs were significantly shorter in. their total mRNA length, as well as in the length of the coding sequence (CDS),. whereas the GC content of the 5UTR was significantly higher (Figure6A,B). Analysis of the effective number of codons. (Nc), which gives an indication of the codon usage bias, could not identify a. significant difference between the selected group of genes and the background. The. sucrose-regulated mRNAs did not contain more uORFs than the background and their. AUGs did not significantly differ from the background consensus. Furthermore,. secondary structure analysis did not reveal enrichment in secondary. structure.Figure 6.

PMC2803206	ResultsAtCWINV4 is highly expressed in nectariesBy microarray analysis, AtCWINV4 was previously identified as having a largely nectary-specific expression profile in wild-type plants (Kram et al., 2009). To determine if other invertase genes shared similar expression patterns to AtCWINV4, raw normalized probe set signal intensity data (Kram et al., 2009) were examined. A total of nine invertase genes, including AtCWINV4, were identified as being confidently expressed in Arabidopsis nectaries (see Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online; Kram et al., 2009); however, AtCWINV4 was the only invertase gene that displayed extreme up regulation in nectaries via microarray (see Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). Moreover, AtCWINV4 was the sole nectary-expressed invertase predicted to be localized to the cell wall (based on TAIR annotation; prediction due to shared sequence similarity with known cell wall invertases). AtCWINV4 encodes a 591 amino acid protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 67 412.2 Da. PSORT analysis (Nakai and Kanehisa, 1991) predicted AtCWINV4 to be secreted from the cell via a 22 amino acid signal peptide, which would be consistent with cell wall localization.To confirm the nectary-enriched expression of AtCWINV4, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on RNA isolated from 11 major tissues, including nectaries. Results shown in Fig. 1A demonstrate that AtCWINV4 was highly expressed in both the lateral and median nectaries of flowers at pre- and post-anthesis (lanes 9-11); it was also expressed in pistils and roots at much lower levels. Similar expression patterns were also observed for a CWINV4 orthologue from Brassica rapa (BrCWINV4, Fig. 1B).Fig. 1.CWINV4 is highly expressed in nectaries. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine the expression profiles of AtCWINV4 (A) and an orthologue from Brassica rapa (B; BrCWINV4, accession number GQ146458). The tissues examined in (A) included: (1) petal; (2) sepal; (3) rosette leaf; (4) stamen; (5) pistil; (6) root; (7) internode shoot; (8) silique; (9) mature median nectaries (Stage 14-15); (10) immature lateral nectaries (Stage 11-12); and, (11) mature lateral nectaries (Stage 14-15). (B) Tissues included: (1) petal; (2) sepal; (3) leaf; (4) stamen; (5) pistil; (6) root; (7) stem; (8) mature median nectaries; and (9) mature lateral nectaries. GAPDH (At3g04120) and a B. rapa ubiquitin gene (BrUBQ, accession number GR719937) were used as constitutively expressed controls. All B. rapa floral tissues examined were from the equivalent of Stage 14-15 Arabidopsis flowers. The images shown are the results obtained after 27 cycles of RT-PCR. (C) Bright field image of Stage 15 Arabidopsis flower expressing an AtCWINV4:GFP fusion, under control of the native AtCWINV4 promoter, and (D) GFP fluorescence derived from same flower. Sepals were removed prior to imaging. Re, receptacle; Pe, petal; LS, long stamen; MN, median nectary; LN, lateral nectary; scale bars, 100 mum.To examine AtCWINV4 expression further, a genomic fragment encoding AtCWINV4, including 1.8 kb of the promoter region, was cloned in-frame with GFP within the binary vector pORE-R4 (to generate AtCWINV4::AtCWINV4:GFP). Wild-type Arabidopsis transformed with this construct displayed nectary-specific GFP fluorescence (Fig. 1C, D). Examinations of these plants via laser scanning confocal microscopy further supported AtCWINV4 tissue-specific expression (see Supplementary Video S1 at JXB online), with GFP appearing to be expressed throughout the entire nectary. Although not definitive, confocal results (see Supplementary Video S1 at JXB online) also suggested that most fluorescence was localized to cell walls due to diffuse patterns of GFP accumulation, which appeared to outline nectary cells. This observation was in contrast to the well-defined localization of a plasma-membrane targeted GFP fusion protein in nectaries (see Supplementary Video S2 at JXB online; 35S::GFP:LTI6b fusion described in Cutler et al., 2000).cwinv4 mutant linesTo probe the biological function of AtCWINV4, two independent T-DNA mutant lines were identified, cwinv4-1 and cwinv4-2. cwinv4-1 had a T-DNA inserted in the second exon, whereas cwinv4-2 had an insertion 200 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 2A). Significantly, cwinv4-1 was identified as a null mutant, whereas AtCWINV4 expression was greatly reduced in cwinv4-2 (Fig. 2B). Indeed, while AtCWINV4 transcripts were readily detected from whole flowers of wild-type plants following 30 cycles of RT-PCR, faint bands derived from cwinv4-2 cDNA were only visible at 35 cycles or greater.Fig. 2.Identification of cwinv4 mutants. Two independent Arabidopsis T-DNA mutant lines (Alonso et al., 2003), cwinv4-1 (SALK_130163) and cwinv4-2 (SALK_017466C), were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre and genotyped to obtain homozygous mutant plants. The relative locations of each T-DNA insertion are shown in (A). RT-PCR, performed on RNA isolated from whole flowers, demonstrated that cwinv4-1 is a null mutant, and that AtCWINV4 is expressed significantly lower in cwinv4-2 flowers than in wild-type (B).cwinv4 flowers have decreased cell wall invertase activityOnce confirmed as mutants, both cwinv4-1 and cwinv4-2 flowers were subsequently examined for extracellular (cell wall) invertase activity. Invertases catalyse the hydrolysis of the disaccharide sucrose into glucose and fructose (Berger et al., 2007; Winter and Huber, 2000b). Cell wall extracts were prepared as previously described (Wright et al., 1998) from whole flowers of cwinv4-1, cwinv4-2, and wild-type plants. Both cwinv4 lines displayed large decreases in total cell wall invertase activity (Fig. 3), whereas intracellular fractions displayed similar activities to wild-type plants (data not shown). The higher cell wall invertase activity observed in cwinv4-2 than cwinv4-1 flowers was probably due to the leaky expression of AtCWINV4 in cwinv4-2 (i.e. cwinv4-1 is a null mutant, whereas cwinv4-2 is a knockdown mutant). It was also noted that cell wall invertase activity was not reduced to zero in cell wall extracts derived from flowers of either cwinv4 mutant. Whether this result is indicative of activity derived from other cell wall invertases, or represents minor contamination from intracellular invertases is unknown. However, it should be noted that whole flowers were used for these assays, not isolated nectaries (i.e. other cell wall invertases may be expressed in petals, stamen, etc).Fig. 3.Cell wall invertase activity is greatly reduced in cwinv4 flowers. Cell wall extracts were prepared from whole Stage 14-15 flowers (25 mg fresh weight) of wild-type and cwinv4 plants, which were subsequently tested for invertase activity. The results from one experiment with cwinv4-1 and cwinv4-2 plants are shown (n=3 independent preparations). Independent and repeated experiments with both cwinv4-1 and cwinv4-2 plants displayed consistent results, with varying amplitudes of total activity for both wild-type and mutant plants.cwinv4 mutants do not secrete nectarTo determine if mutations occurring within AtCWINV4 have an impact on nectar production, individual flowers were examined for the presence of nectar droplets, which accumulate inside the cups formed by sepals surrounding the lateral nectaries. Figure 4A illustrates a typical analysis, and shows a nectar droplet clinging to the inside of a sepal of a wild-type flower; nectar droplets were never observed within either cwinv4-1 or cwinv4-2 flowers (Table 2; Fig. 4B). Interestingly, extremely limited indications of secretion very rarely appeared inside the sepals of cwinv4-2 flowers; however, nectar droplets were never present (only a thin glistening film), and due to the extremely rare occurrence (c. 5% of flowers) and limited amount of fluid produced, these putative secretions could neither be collected nor analysed. If this rarely observed fluid truly represented nectar secretion, it would be consistent with the leaky expression of CWINV4 found in cwinv4-2.Table 2.Examination of nectar production in wild-type and cwinv4 flowersWild-typecwinv4-1cwinv4-2No. of flowers with nectara250/2500/2500b/250aFlowers were examined for nectar droplets accumulating inside sepals surrounding lateral nectaries. A minimum of ten individual plants were examined for each line.bExtremely limited indications of fluid very rarely appeared inside the sepals of cwinv4-2 flowers; however, no nectar droplets ever accumulated inside the flowers of these plants. These findings are in line with the leaky expression of AtCWINV4 found within cwinv4-2.Fig. 4.cwinv4 flowers do not secrete nectar. Nectar production in Arabidopsis flowers can be examined by gently peeling back the sepal. Nectar droplets accumulating within the sepal cups surrounding lateral nectaries (LN) were consistently present in wild-type plants (circled in A), whereas neither cwinv4 mutant secreted nectar (e.g. B; Table 2). Both cwinv4 mutants also accumulated higher than normal levels of starch within the receptacle (arrowheads), which often extended into the pedicel (C, D). Conversely, the stomata of wild-type nectaries stained heavily for starch (E, arrowheads), whereas those of cwinv4 flowers did not (F). The morphology of cwinv4 nectaries was examined to determine if aberrant nectary structure might account for the lack of nectar secretion. In all flowers examined, cwinv4 nectaries (H) appeared to have similar morphology to wild-type plants (G). Scale bars are 50 mum; LN, lateral nectary; SS, short stamen.cwinv4 flowers display altered patterns of starch accumulationInvertases play key roles in sugar source-sink relationships (Roitsch, 1999; Roitsch and Ehness, 2000). Thus, whole flowers were examined for altered patterns of starch accumulation via iodine-potassium iodide (IKI) staining. cwinv4 lines displayed an obvious increase in starch accumulation within the floral receptacle, which often extended into the pedicel (Fig. 4C, D). Conversely, wild-type flowers accumulated high levels of starch within nectarial stomata, whereas cwinv4 plants did not (Fig 4E, F).Nectary ultrastructure is normal in cwinv4 flowersScanning electron microscopy was used to examine if any defects in nectary development or morphology could account for the lack of nectar production observed in the cwinv4 mutant lines. Both mutant lines displayed all structural hallmarks of wild-type nectaries, including having multiple modified stomata (in an open conformation) and being covered by a highly reticulated cuticle (Fig. 4G, H). Confocal microscopy utilizing lipophilic fluorescent dyes (i.e. FM4-64) also demonstrated normal nectary morphology within cwinv4 flowers (data not shown).cwinv4 flowers accumulate less soluble sugarRelated to the starch analyses described above, it seemed logical to examine whether cwinv4 mutants displayed changes in the accumulation of soluble sugars. Simple sugars were extracted from whole flowers and assayed as previously described (Bethke and Busse, 2008). Results shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that both cwinv4-1 and cwinv4-2 flowers accumulated significantly lower levels of soluble sugars, specifically sucrose and glucose, than wild-type plants. Notably, the overall ratio of glucose-to-sucrose was similar in wild-type and cwinv4 flowers (90% glucose and 10% sucrose in all lines examined, data not shown).Fig. 5.cwinv4 flowers accumulate decreased total soluble sugar. Whole flowers (Stage 14-15) from both cwinv4-1 and cwinv4-2 displayed significantly lower levels of total soluble sugar (sucrose and glucose) than wild-type plants (n=3, *P=0.027 and 0.013, respectively). Results are displayed as total absorbance per mg of floral tissue 100. The relative proportion of sucrose-to-glucose was similar between cwinv4 and wild-type flowers (data not shown)..
PMC4268804	Results and discussion. . Populus trichocarpa UGEc is bifunctional in vitro. In order to compare the performance of different UGEs for the engineering purpose, we first cloned a UGE from poplar since it might be preferable to use a poplar gene for the ultimate translation on the engineering approach to a biofuel crop such as poplar. Out of the UGEs encoded in the Populus trichocarpa genome, we selected one, referred to as PtUGEc (XP_002299469, POPTR_0001s10700g). Due to its higher sequence similarity to the non-bifunctional AtUGEs of Clade II that preferentially act in interconverting UDP-Glc to UDP-Gal (Figure1), PtUGEc seemed a good candidate for generating higher amounts of galactan. The in vitro activity of purified His-PtUGEc (Figure2A) was tested in reactions with different nucleotide sugars (UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-Xyl, UDP-Ara). Proportions of UDP-sugars after incubation for 30min show that the PtUGEc enzyme is bifunctional, interconverting UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal, as well as UDP-Xyl and UDP-Ara (Figure2B). The enzymatic reaction does not require the addition of NAD+, most likely because of non-covalent binding and co-purification of NAD+ together with the enzyme, as it has been shown for the barley HvUGE1 [17]. Final UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc concentrations were the same in reactions starting with UDP-Gal or with UDP-Glc, indicating that equilibrium levels were reached. The reactions starting with either UDP-Xyl or UDP-Ara did not completely reach the equilibrium level, suggesting that the reaction rates for UDP-Xyl/UDP-Ara interconversion are slower than for UDP-Gal/UDP-Glc. The bifunctional enzymatic characteristics of PtUGEc were somewhat unexpected for a UGE belonging to Clade II since other UGEs from this clade have been found to be specific for UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal interconversion. However, structural features that determine bifunctionality vs. mono-functionality are not known yet.Figure 2. UDP-glucose 4-epimerase activity of recombinant. Pt. UGEc protein. (A) SDS-PAGE analysis of different fractions from the purification of His-PtUGEc. (B-I) High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatograms of nucleotide sugars incubated for 30min with (left panels) or without (right panels) recombinant PtUGEc protein.. . . All UGE constructs complement the UGE4rhd1 phenotype. In order to verify the functionality of UGE constructs, PtUGEc and the Arabidopsis AtUGE2, AtUGE4, and AtUGE5 proteins were overexpressed under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in the Arabidopsis uge4 mutant background. Loss of function of UGE4 results in a reduced root elongation rate and swelling of root epidermal cells probably as a result of defective cell wall matrix carbohydrate biosynthesis [12,18]. Thus, a simple visual screen can confirm complementation of the wild-type phenotype and thereby not only expression but also functionality of the UGE proteins. The four different UGE constructs all suppressed the root epidermal swelling and the reduced root length confirming previous UGE complementation results published by Barber et al. [9] and demonstrating that the poplar PtUGEc is functional in planta (Figure3). The slight root length decrease in our UGE overexpressor plants as compared to wild type indicates however, that complementation is not complete. Expression of AtUGE2 and AtUGE5 resulted in almost complete complementation.Figure 3. Overexpression of. At. UGE2,. At. UGE4,. At. UGE5, or. Pt. UGEc rescues the. uge4. mutant phenotype. The UGE expressing plants rescue the uge4 phenotype to various extent. Average root length of Col-0, uge4 and transgenic seedlings in uge4 background was determined. Data show meanSD (n =50).. . . Plants overexpressing UGE show no increase in cell wall bound galactose in leaf or stem cell walls. All AtUGE2, AtUGE4, AtUGE5, or PtUGEc overexpressing Arabidopsis plants had a growth phenotype similar to wild-type Col-0 and the empty vector control plants. The monosaccharide composition of non-cellulosic polysaccharides from leaves and stems was analyzed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). Two to four independent transgenic lines were analyzed for each construct in the T2 generation. Data for one representative line for each construct is shown in Figure4. The transgenic Arabidopsis UGE lines had no significant changes in sugar composition compared to the empty vector control plants in leaf cell walls (Figure4A) or in stem cell walls (Figure4B).Figure 4. Cell wall monosaccharide composition analysis of leaf (A) and stem (B) material from UGE overexpression plants. Monosaccharide composition analysis of leaf (A) and stem (B) cell walls of plants constitutively overexpressing AtUGE2, AtUGE4, AtUGE5 did not show any significant differences compared to the empty vector control (EVC) (p>0.05, pairwise t-test with Holm-Bonferroni correction for family-wise error rate). Monosaccharide levels are shown as molar percentageSD (n =6). GalA, alpha-d-galacturonic acid; GlcA, alpha-d-glucuronic acid.. Recently, we have shown that overexpression of GalS1 in planta can lead to a significant 40% increase in total cell wall galactose in leaves [5]. Thus, the UDP-Gal substrate does not seem to be limiting for galactose incorporation into the cell wall in leaves and therefore an increase in interconverting UGE enzymes is not necessarily expected to lead to an increase in cell wall galactan.. . . Cell wall bound galactose levels are increased in stem cell walls of co-overexpressers. Since overexpression of AtUGE2, AtUGE4, AtUGE5, or PtUGEc alone did not result in a significant increase of total galactose in stems, we designed a gene stacking approach by co-expressing AtUGE2 together with the galactan synthase GalS1. AtUGE2 was chosen because it showed efficient complementation of the uge4 root phenotype (Figure3). Although we had initially preferred to use a poplar UGE, PtUGEc was not a good choice because of its bispecificity and incomplete ability to complement uge4. We designed two different constructs for AtUGE2 expression. One under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter (p35S:UGE2) and a second fiber-specific construct (pIRX5:NST1-UGE2). The fiber-specific construct is under control of the IRX5 promoter and in addition expresses the transcription factor NST1 leading to a positive-artificial feedback loop and increased wall thickness in fiber cells, as previously reported [2]. In this construct UGE2 is expressed from the same pIRX5 promoter, separated from NST1 with the 2A sequence from foot-and-mouth disease virus allowing coordinate expression of multiple proteins [19]. The stem cell wall composition was analyzed in the T2 generation for three independent lines for each construct. For each construct there was no difference between the independent lines and one line was selected for confirmation of the results in the T3 generation (Figure5). Expression of p35S:UGE2 and pIRX5:NST1-UGE2, respectively, in the background of plants constitutively overexpressing GalS1 (p35S:GalS1) led to significantly increased galactose levels (p0.01) as shown by analysis of the monosaccharide composition of cell walls from stems (Figure5). While p35S:UGE2/p35S:GalS1 plants showed a galactose increase of more than 80%, the pIRX5:NST1-UGE2/p35S:GalS1 galactose levels were only increased by 44% as compared to empty vector control (EVC) plants (Figure5). Plants expressing p35S:GalS1 alone had only a slight increase in stem wall bound galactose, and no galactose increase was observed when the pIRX5:NST1-UGE2 construct was incorporated in the wild-type background. The apparent increase in xylose in plants containing the pIRX5:NST1-UGE2 construct for overexpression of the feedback-loop construct with NST1 could be expected in plants with increased fiber cell wall density and more xylan. However, the xylose content in these plants is not significantly different from the control (p>0.05 even without Holm-Bonferroni correction). These results show that GalS1 is limiting for galactan synthesis in both leaves and stems while UGEs are not. However, when GalS1 is overexpressed, AtUGE2 or other UGEs seem to become limiting for how much galactan can be accumulated in cell walls of Arabidopsis plant stems. The 80% increase in cell wall galactose may not be the limit for what can be achieved. UDP-Gal formed by UGE2 must be transported into the Golgi lumen to be used by GalS1, and it is possible that the transport becomes limiting when both UGE2 and GalS1 are overexpressed. Recently, a UDP-Gal transporter URGT1 has been characterized, the overexpression of which results in increased cell wall galactan in leaves [20]. We are currently investigating the effect of overexpressing the transporter together with UGE2 and GalS1.Figure 5. Cell wall monosaccharide composition analysis of stems from plants co-overexpressing. At. UGE2 and GalS1. The monosaccharide composition of stems from plants in the T3 generation expressing either p35S:GalS1 or pIRX5:NST1-UGE2 or co-overexpressing either pIRX5:NST1-UGE2/p35S:GalS1 or p35S:UGE2/p35S:GalS1 was determined. Monosaccharide levels are shown as molar percentageSD (n =5). Significantly increased levels of galactose (p0.01, indicated with asterisks) were found with the two co-expressing constructs pIRX5:NST1-UGE2/p35S:GalS1 and p35S:UGE2/p35S:GalS1, while no other sugars were different from empty vector control plants (EVC) in any of the transgenic plants (p>0.05). Analysis in the T2 generation of three independent lines for each construct showed the same results. The data were analyzed by pairwise t-test with Holm-Bonferroni correction for family-wise error rate. GalA, alpha-d-galacturonic acid; GlcA, alpha-d-glucuronic acid.. The increase in galactose of p35S:UGE2/p35S:GalS1 and pIRX5:NST1-UGE2/p35S:GalS1 co-overexpressor plants was further investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy of stem sections (Figure6). Although immunofluorescence microscopy is not easily quantified, the detection of the LM5 galactan epitope was strongly increased specifically in the secondary cell walls of top and bottom stem sections of p35S:UGE2/p35S:GalS1 and pIRX5:NST1-UGE2/p35S:GalS1 co-overexpressors, as compared to overexpressor lines of p35S:GalS1 or pIRX5:NST1-UGE2 alone, or the empty vector control. The fiber-specific pIRX5 constructs in addition resulted in highly thickened cell walls as an effect of overexpressing NST1 under the IRX5 promoter and as visualized by lignin autofluorescence using a confocal microscope (Figure6). On the one hand this increase in biomass density is highly desirable to improve the cost-effectiveness of lignocellulosic bioenergy production. On the other hand however, the increase in xylan rather results in more recalcitrance and is counteracting the increase in the C6/C5 sugar ratio, which is obtained due to increased galactan deposition. Therefore, future implementation of galactan overexpression could be improved by simultaneously downregulating xylan deposition in fiber cells. This could be achieved by using mutants deficient in xylan that have been complemented by reintroducing xylan biosynthesis specifically into the xylem vessels in order to restore wild type-like growth of the plants, as recently described [3]. Conceivably, the lignin content in fiber cells also needs to be decreased.Figure 6. Galactan and lignin detection in stem sections. beta-1,4-galactan was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy using the LM5 antibody. Stem sections from the top and bottom of inflorescence stems were analyzed. Plants co-expressing either pIRX5:NST1-UGE2/ p35S:GalS1 or p35S:UGE2/p35S:GalS1 show a very strong labeling of galactan in the secondary wall as compared to the empty vector control or plants expressing only p35S:GalS1 or pIRX5:NST1-UGE2. Visualization of lignin autofluorescence using a confocal microscope under UV light shows the increase in fiber cell wall density with constructs using the pIRX5 promoter. Bars are 100mum for bottom stem and lignin autofluorescence pictures, 50mum for top stems and 10mum for lignin close ups..
PMC1557525	Results. We have analyzed the function of the Arabidopsis orthologue of the budding yeast MND1 gene (AtMND1). Loss of AtMND1 did not affect normal vegetative development but caused fragmentation and missegregation of chromosomes in male and female meiosis, formation of inviable gametes, and sterility. Analysis of the Atmnd1 Atspo11-1 double mutant indicated that chromosome fragmentation in Atmnd1 was suppressed by loss of Atspo11-1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that homologous pairing failed to occur and homologues remained apart throughout meiosis. AtMND1 showed strong expression in meiocytes as revealed by RNA in situs..
PMC3341217	Results. . Experimental design. To test for site-specific recombination, we initially sought to use a gain-of-function strategy whereby excision of a transgene would lead to promoter fusion with a previously distal marker [14]. Hence, pN6-Bxb1 was configured with a CaMV 35S promoter (35S) proximal to a 760 bp stuffer region followed by a distal gusA coding region (Figure 1a). The stuffer region is flanked by directly oriented attP and attB recognition sites of the Bxb1 recombinase. The expectation was that prior to site-specific recombination, 35S would not drive expression of gusA due the presence of the stuffer region. After recombination, the stuffer would be removed and activate expression of the gusA reporter gene (Figure 1c). In this strategy, we first introduced the recombination target (pN6-Bxb1) into the Arabidopsis genome via Agrobacterium transformation. These target lines, or 'TA' lines, were then transformed with the second construct, pCOXS3-Bxb1 (Figure 1b) that expresses the recombinase gene to produce the 'TR' lines. Upon site-specific excision of the recognition site-flanked DNA, the TR1 plants were back crossed to wild type plants and the BC1 progeny screened for segregants that retain the excision event but lack the recombinase gene. Lines positive for excision but negative for the recombinase gene were self-fertilized. To remove possible de novo recombinase expression contamination to the BC1 results the 'selfed' progeny (S1) lines were analyzed as a final confirmation for germinal transmission. A similar strategy was employed in previous recombinase research on phiC31 [6].. . Figure 1. .

Target lines for Bxb1 recombination. The target construct pN6-Bxb1 was introduced into Arabidopsis, and 44 hygromycin resistant lines were confirmed by PCR detection of a 1.23 kb product that spans the recognition site-flanked stuffer region (data not shown). Of those, 23 pN6-Bxb1 lines were propagated to the TA2 generation and examined by Southern blot for single copy T-DNA integration. EcoRI or BamHI each cuts once within the target T-DNA (Figure 1a). Hybridization with a gusA probe of EcoRI or BamHI cleaved genomic DNA should reveal a band size > 4.10 kb, the length of the cleaved T-DNA. A hybridizing band < 4.10 kb would indicate integration of a truncated T-DNA. From this analysis, 4 of the 23 pN6-Bxb1 plants were determined to contain a single copy of a likely complete T-DNA (data not shown) and designated TA2-Bxb1.9, 12, 28 and 35. The 1.23 kb PCR product from each of these lines was sequenced to confirm the presence of intact attP and attB sites (Figure 1d).. . . Arabidopsis OXS3 promoter for expression of Bxb1. As previous research has demonstrated successful germline tissue expression of other recombinase genes [15], we again chose the 1.5 kb promoter fragment of the Arabidopsis Oxidative Stress 3gene (OXS3, At5g56550) [16] for Bxb1 transgene expression and generated the plasmid construct pCOXS3-Bxb1 (Figure 1b).. . . Secondary transformation of TA target lines. The TA3 generation of Bxb1.9, 12, 28 & 35 plant lines were transformed with Agrobacterium harboring the pCOXS3-Bxb1 vector producing the TR1 plant lines. Kanamycin resistant transformants that exhibited a wild type appearance and growth rate were identified and grown in the greenhouse. Three-week old TR1 transformants were tested for the presence of the Bxb1 gene. PCR amplification by primers g and h (Figure 1b) showed that a majority of the plants harbor the recombinase gene (Figure 2b). The groups of plants that harbor the Bxb1 gene were designated TR1-Bxb1.9, 12, 28 and 35 (Table 1).. . Figure 2. .

The TR1-Bxb1 lines were examined using histochemical staining to detect gusA encoded reporter gene activity. The TR1-Bxb1 lines, however, exhibited variable levels of beta-glucuronidase activity. One interpretation of this reduced activity is that the lines were undergoing low levels of Bxb1-mediated excision, but PCR analysis of lines where GUS activity was weak or undetectable were positive for excision of the target DNA. Given that the screening for GUS activity was not a reliable indicator of Bxb1 site-specific recombination, we subsequently utilized PCR to screen for site-specific excision.. With the 48 TR1-Bxb1.9, 78 TR1-Bxb1.12, 18 TR1-Bxb1.28 and 44 TR1-Bxb1.35 individuals, PCR with primers e and f (Figure 1c) detected a 0.43 kb product expected for site-specific excision (Figure 2, Table 1). However, the 1.23 kb product representing the parental configuration was also detected in some individuals, which indicates the presence of unexcised target DNA. As each individual harbors an independent COXS3-Bxb1 T-DNA integration at a different genomic location, with perhaps a different copy number or structural arrangements, the incomplete excision in some individuals was likely due to variability in recombinase gene expression. Based on the genomic PCR results, 35-89% of the Bxb1 positive TR1 plants generated only the 0.43 kb excision PCR product (Table 1).. . . Segregation of the Bxb1 gene. To determine if the genomic excision event occurred in the germline tissue, we examined whether the excised target was heritably transmitted to the progeny lacking the Bxb1 gene. This analysis also determines whether or not the excision reaction was generated de novo in each generation. Individuals were chosen from each of the TR1-Bxb1.9, TR1-Bxb1.12 TR1-Bxb1.28 and TR1-Bxb1.35 families (Table 2) to pollinate wild type recipients. The backcross progenies (BC1) were grown without selection and then screened by PCR for the target locus (primers e and f) and the recombinase gene (primers g and h), which reveals whether excision occurred (0.43 kb band) or not (1.23 kb band) and if Bxb1 was present or absent. With the TR1-Bxb1.9, TR1-Bxb1.12, TR1-Bxb1.28 and TR1-Bxb1.35, 75% (229 of 306), 65% (70 of 107), 95% (156 of 165) and 73% (222 of 306) of the BC1 plants harbored the target DNA, respectively (Table 2).. .

For the nine TR1-Bxb1.9 plants that were backcrossed, 77% of the progeny plants (177 of 229) that harbor the target locus showed excision of the attP and attB-flanked DNA, with 21% (37 of 177) lacking the recombinase gene (Table 2). Of the TR1-Bxb1.12 plants, 61% (43 of 70) of target plants showed excision of the attP and attB-flanked target, and 9.3% (4 of 43) lack the recombinase gene (Table 2). A total of 87% of the TR1-Bxb1.28 plants (135 of 156) harbor the target locus with excision of the attP and attB-flanked DNA, 24% (32 of 135) lack the recombinase gene (Figure 2c, d; Table 2). Out of the ten TR1-Bxb1.35 plants that were backcrossed, 78% of the plants (173 of 222) that harbor the target locus showed excision of the attP and attB-flanked DNA, with 16% (27 of 173) lacking the recombinase gene. The genomic excision 0.43 kb PCR product from two representative individuals from each family was sequenced and examined for conservative recombination. All eight Bxb1-mediated excision PCR products sequenced were conservative and site specific (Figure 1e).. . . Molecular confirmation of the BC1 progeny. BC1 plants that showed excision but lacked the recombinase gene were self-fertilized to generate progeny designated S1-Bxb1. PCR analysis on these plants confirmed the inheritance of the excision event in the absence of the Bxb1 recombinase gene (Figure 3), which indicates germinal transmission. For further molecular confirmation, Southern blot hybridization was conducted on two selected S1 individuals. The genomic DNA was isolated and cleaved with EcoRV, which is expected to liberate either a 1.60 kb or a 0.95 kb fragment from the non-recombined or recombined structure, respectively (Figure 1a, c). The GUS1350 probe detected the 1.60 kb band in the parental lines but not in the S1 plants (Figure 4a, lanes 1-8). Instead, only the 0.95 kb band was observed for S1 plants from the TR1-Bxb1 lineage. The genomic DNA was also PCR amplified with primers g and h (Figure 1b), which would generate a 0.72 kb fragment if the genome were to harbor a COXS3-Bxb1 T-DNA. Whole plant genomic DNA was PCR amplified to ensure the absence of the Bxb1 transgene since previous screening methods only used DNA from individual leaves and could miss mosaic plants. Amplification detected the Bxb1 gene fragment in the parental control plants but not in the S1 plants, validating that these excision positive plants were recombinase negative (Figure 4b, lanes 1-8).. .

Control lanes are wt (wild type Arabidopsis DNA) and TA3-Bxb1.9, (target lines).. . . . We further isolated, by segregation, Bxb1 recombinase expression lines for the purpose of crossing to the original TA3 target lines to determine if a genomic excision event could be facilitated using this alternative approach. Two independent lines from each of three (TR1-Bxb1.9, 12, and 35) secondary transformation events were isolated from segregating populations via PCR (Table 2) and designated lines COXS3-9.17, 9.31; COXS3-12.69, 12.72 and COXS3-35.15, 35.33. Recombinase expression lines were not isolated from the TR1-Bxb1.28 transformation event due to the apparent homozygosity of original TA3-Bxb1.28 target line (Figure 5a, b; Table 2). Each of these six independently isolated lines was crossed to the original target line TA3-Bxb1.28. The manually crossed progenies (MC1) were grown without selection and screened by PCR for the target locus (primers e and f) and the recombinase gene (primers g and h; Figure 5c, d). Of the MC1-Bxb1.9 plants that carried both the target locus and Bxb1 gene, 100% (47 of 47) of the tested individuals displayed the 0.43 kb excision band in the absence of the unexcised 1.23 kb target band when screened using PCR (Table 3; Figure 5c, d). Of the MC1-Bxb1.12 plants with both the target and Bxb1, 80% (17 of 21) generated only the 0.43 kb excision PCR product (Table 3). While 63% (37 of 59) of the MC1-Bxb1.35 individuals generated only the 0.43 kb PCR product derived from an excised genomic target (Table 3).. . Figure 5. .

PMC3134342	Results. . Phylogenetic relationships within the A/N-Inv gene family. Figure 1 shows an unrooted phylogenetic tree with nine putative A/N-Invs (At-A/N-InvA-I) from Arabidopsis together with other functionally characterized plant A/N-Invs. The alpha and beta clusters are clearly separated. Within the alpha cluster, two further subgroups can be discerned (LtINV, OsNIN3, BvINV, and At-A/N-InvE on one hand; OsNIN1, DcINV, At-A/N-InvC, At-A/N-InvH, and At-A/N-InvA on the other hand). Members of the latter subgroup localize in mitochondria as demonstrated experimentally (At-A/N-InvA, this study; OsNIN1, Murayama and Handa, 2007) or as predicted by Target P (DcInv, At-A/N-InvH, and At-A/N-InvC). The other subgroup harbours OsNIN3 and At-A/N-InvE (At5g22510) which are localized in plastids (Murayama and Handa, 2007; Vargas et al., 2008). BvINV is also predicted to be localized in plastids. However, LtINV is predicted to localize in mitochondria.. . Fig. 1.. . Phylogenetic tree of A/N-Invs. An unrooted phylogenetic tree containing nine Arabidopsis A/N-Invs (At-A/N-Inv A-I) and other functionally studied A/N-Invs, drawn by Clustal W2. The alpha and beta type of A/N-Invs can be discriminated. At-A/N-InvA and At-A/N-InvG, studied in this manuscript, are encircled. At-A/N-InvA, At1g56560; At-A/N-InvG, At1g35580 (Qi et al., 2007; Lou et al., 2007); At-A/N-InvF, At1g72000; At-A/N-InvH, At3g05820; At-A/N-InvC, At4g06500; At-A/N-InvI, At4g09510 (Barratt et al., 2009); At-A/N-InvE, At5g22510 (Vargas et al., 2008); At-A/N-InvD, At1g22650; At-A/N-InvB, At4g34860; AsinvA, Anabaena sp.

Referring to the (putative) subcellular localization of the enzymes, the confidence levels generated by target P are indicated. mTP, mitochondrial; cTP, chloroplastic; OP, other (presumably cytosolic); *, proven by localization studies. For a more extensive phylogenetic tree of (putative) At-A/N Invs, refer to the supplementary data of Vargas et al. (2008).. . . . The cytosolic At-A/N-InvG is in the beta cluster. All the members of this cluster are believed to be cytosolic proteins based on computational prediction. Besides At-A/N-InvF, At-A/N-InvD, At-A/N-InvB, Oscyt-Inv (Jia et al., 2008), LjInv1 (Flemetakis et al., 2006), Ta-A/N-Inv (Vargas et al., 2007), and At-A/N-InvI (Barratt et al., 2009) are well-characterized A/N-Invs.. . . At-A/N-InvA is located in mitochondria. To test the organellar localization of At-A/N-InvA and At-A/N-InvG in the alpha and beta subgroups as predicted by Ji et al. (2005) and Murayama and Handa (2007), full-length and N-terminal versions of At-A/N-InvA and At-A/N-InvG in-frame with GFP were designed. Confocal microscopy was used to localize the resulting GFP fusion proteins (and a GFP only control) in Arabidopsis protoplasts, incubated for 12h under dim light. In each case, 50 cells were investigated and >95% showed the subcellular localization as described. As expected based on the phylogenetic tree, the protoplasts expressing At-A/N-InvGn::GFP (Fig. 2c) and At-A/N-InvG::GFP (Fig. 2b), as well as the GFP control (Fig. 2a), showed fluorescence in the cytosol. In contrast, At-A/N-InvA::GFP (Fig. 2d) and At-A/N-InvAn::GFP (Fig. 2e) were mainly detected in small vesicle-like structures surrounding the chloroplasts. A clear overlap with the MitoTracker Orange marker demonstrated the mitochondrial location of At-A/N-InvA and suggests that the targeting signal for mitochondrial localization is in the N-terminal part of the protein. HXK1 (At4g29130) associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM; Kim et al., 2006) was used as an additional control for mitochondrial localization (Fig. 2f). The results show that At-A/N-InvA and HXK1 occur remarkably close to each other.. . Fig. 2.. . Transient expression of fusion proteins in Arabidopsis protoplasts.

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . . . Enzymatic activities of recombinant At-A/N-InvA and At-A/N-InvG, and inhibition by TRIS. To confirm their catalytic activities, At-A/N-InvA and At-A/N-InvG were heterologously expressed in E. coli. Fully functional recombinant enzymes were obtained. The pH optima, the Km, and the inhibitory effect of TRIS at pH 8.2 were determined. At-A/N-InvA shows a neutral pH optimum at about pH 7.5, and its activity is rather stable over a wide pH range (from pH 5.0 to 10.0: Fig. 3a). In contrast, the pH optimum of At-A/N-InvG is 9.5 (Fig. 3a), indicating that it can be classified as an alkaline invertase. A typical inhibitory effect of TRIS on At-A/N-InvA activity was found (Fig. 3b), as observed for other A/N-Invs (Van den Ende and Van Laere, 1995, and references therein). In contrast, the At-A/N-InvG activity increased at the lower TRIS concentrations (0.5-4mM range; Fig. 3b), 25-30mM TRIS is needed for 50% inhibition, and the activity is strongly inhibited by 50mM TRIS. The estimated Km for At-A/N-InvG was 8.4mM, compared with 17mM for At-A/N-InvA (Fig. 3c). This is in the same range as the Kms of other A/N-Invs (Vargas et al., 2003).. . Fig. 3.. .

T-DNA insertion lines for At-A/N-InvA (Salk_109830 and Salk_015233, termed atinva) and At-A/N-InvG (Salk_095807, termed atinvg) (Fig. 4a) were grown on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 0, 1, and 5% (w/v) Suc or Mtl, and growth was compared with that of wt plants up to 15d post-germination (Fig. 4b). The Mtl treatments resulted in more severe phenotypes compared with the Suc treatments. While Suc and Mtl both cause osmotic stress, Mtl is probably imported much more slowly and cannot be further metabolized once taken up. Consistent with the results of Barratt et al. (2009), atinvg showed a severe root growth defect and a weaker leaf growth compared with the wt, at 0, 1, and 5% Suc and Mtl. Surprisingly, atinva knockout plants showed an even more severe growth phenotype compared with atinvg, affected in both leaf growth and root development (Fig. 4b). However, the main root length of atinva knockouts was relatively less affected at 1% Suc, suggesting that mitochondrial At-A/N-InvA activity is more important under conditions of both sugar starvation (0% Suc) and excess sugar or osmotic stress (5% Suc). Root lengths of wt, atinva, and atinvg plants (MS agar plate, 1.5% Suc, 15d post-germination) were recorded. Fifty plants of each type were selected. The mean root length of atinva knockouts is remarkably shorter (44% of the wt), while atinvg knockout roots are less affected (Fig. 4c). Soil-grown atinva plants also showed a significantly reduced leaf and shoot development compared with atinvg and wt plants (Fig. 4d).. . Fig. 4.. . Phenotypes of wt, atinva, and atinvg knockout plants.

Vertical bars represent the SE for n=3. (d) Soil-grown phenotypes of wt, atinva, and atinvg plants (5 and 14 weeks, respectively). (e) Relative total A/N-Inv activities of atinva and atinvg compared with the wt leaves (5 weeks). Vertical bars represent the SE for n=3. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . A/N-Invs were extracted from freshly harvested leaf material of atinva, atinvg, and wt plants. Total A/N-Inv activities were measured at pH 8.5 (to minimize side activities of acid invertases). By comparison with wt plants, the total A/N-Inv activities of atinva and atinvg were 40% and 35% lower (Fig. 4e). Knocking out only one out of nine A/N-Invs considerably affects both the growth phenotype and the total A/N-Inv activity, suggesting that both At-A/N-InvA and At-A/N-InvG make up a considerable part of the total activity. Alternatively, the At-A/N-InvA and At-A/N-InvG proteins themselves (independently of their catalytic activities) might play a role in controlling the total A/N-Inv activity and overall plant development, as suggested before by Lou et al. (2007) for At-A/N-InvG.. . . Expression of genes involved in oxidative stress defence. A clear connection between mitochondria-associated HXK (mtHXK) activity and ROS homeostasis was recently demonstrated (Camacho-Pereira et al., 2009; Bolouri-Moghaddam et al., 2010). It was hypothesized that A/N-Invs might assist in delivering Glc to mtHXK. Therefore, it was decided to investigate the expression levels of At-A/N-InvA, At-A/N-InvG, HXK1, and the oxidative stress-responsive MSD1, FSD1, CSD1, CAT2, and APX2 genes in response to H2O2 by qRT-PCR. For this purpose, detached wt, atinva, and atinvg mature leaves were incubated in water or 20mM H2O2 for 10h.. Except for FSD1, all transcript levels significantly increased by the application of exogenous H2O2 in wt leaves (Table 1). Addition of H2O2 to the mutants generally resulted in even higher transcript levels, but untreated mutant leaves already showed enhanced basal levels of oxidative stress-associated gene expression. In line with previous observations (Fryer et al., 2003; Costa et al., 2010), APX2 seems to be the most sensitive to H2O2 treatment. Therefore, this gene was investigated further, and an APX2 promoter-luciferase (LUC) construct was created as an oxidative stress reporter for cellular assays (see Discussion).. .

The effect of transient At-A/N-InvA and At-A/N-InvG overexpression was analysed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts incubated for 4h in the light or in darkness (Table 2) with addition of Glc (30 mM), Suc (30 mM), Mtl (30mM), H2O2 (200muM), ABA (10muM), AsA (30mM), DCMU (10muM), and a combination of H2O2 and Suc (HS). Both H2O2 and ABA activated the APX2 promoter in transfected wt protoplasts (Table 2). In contrast, the addition of the metabolizable sugars Glc and Suc as well as AsA down-regulated APX2 promoter activity, while Mtl had no effect. Interestingly, the addition of Suc together with H2O2 resulted in a less pronounced activation of the APX2 promoter compared with H2O2 alone. Furthermore, overexpressing At-A/N-InvA and At-A/N-InvG down-regulated the APX2 promoter, in both the control and treated conditions. DCMU as an inhibitor of photosynthesis worked as an inhibitor of APX2 promoter activity in the light, and as an activator in the dark (Table 2).. . Table 2.. .

PMC3022413	Results. . Sequence analysis, phylogenetic tree, and subcellular localization of TaABC1. Using the Conserved Domain Database search engine at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2009), a conserved region of 120 amino acids that is characteristic of the so-called ABC1 protein family (Fig. 1A) was detected in the putative TaABC1 protein sequence (HM773264). In addition, an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase choline kinase (APH_ChoK) domain was also detected within the putative protein sequence of TaABC1 (Fig. 1A).. . Fig. 1.. . Structure, localization, and homological analysis of TaABC1. (A) Schematic illustration of the TaABC1 protein structure. Identified domains are depicted as follows: black box, ABC1; dotted box, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase (APH_ChoK) domain; white box, Ser/Thr protein kinase (S/T K). (B) Phylogenetic tree of ABC1 proteins. The tree was constructed with the MEGA 4.1 program; bootstrap values are in percentages. (C) Subcellular localization of TaABC1 protein by GFP fusion expression in onion epidermal cells. The GFP control or TaABC1-GFP fusion was driven by the CaMV 35S promoter. Cells were bombarded with DNA-coated gold particles and analysed by fluorescence microscopy. Photographs were taken after 16h of incubation. Panels from left to right: images of GFP control (a) or TaABC1-GFP (d) in dark field, in bright field (b and e), and the combined images (c and f). (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the putative amino acid sequences of TaABC1, some plant ABC1 proteins, and yeast ABC1 protein (Fig. 1B). TaABC1 was clustered in the same monophyletic group as putative ABC1 proteins from rice, sorghum, and maize. In addition, TaABC1 protein showed >59.6% identity with putative ABC1 proteins from Ricinuss communis, Populus tichocarpa, and A. thaliana, but <30% identity with AtOSA1, AtABC1, and yeast ABC1. Furthermore, the results indicated that AtOSA1 protein did not group with AtABC1 and yeast ABC1 protein, but rather it formed a separate branch.. To examine its subcellular localization, TaABC1 was fused in-frame to the GFP gene under control of the CaMV 35S promoter. The constructs TaABC1-GFP and GFP were introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. As shown in Fig. 1C, the TaABC1-GFP was localized to the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus.. . . Salt and osmotic responses of TaABC1-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants. Six T4 homozygous transgenic lines were randomly selected for detection of gene expression. Further phenotypic analyses were performed on three lines (OE1, OE4, and OE6) which possess a higher expression level of TaABC1 (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online).. Salts inhibit seedling growth in a concentration-dependent manner (Xiong et al., 2002). Previous studies showed that TaABC1 was a salt-induced gene (Wang et al., 2007), but the role of TaABC1 in response to salt was not clear. The 35S-TaABC1 Arabidopsis plants and the two controls were grown as described in the Materials and methods. Differences were observed at the young seedling stage. Cotyledon greening and expansion, as well as root growth of the control plants, were inhibited at the seedling stage on plates containing 100mM NaCl (Fig. 2A). When the NaCl concentration was increased to 200mM, the growth of control plants was strongly inhibited and <20% of seedlings had small green cotyledons, whereas TaABC1 transgenic seedlings were still green (Fig. 2B). In the salinity stress tests, a significant difference was observed in terms of cell membrane stability between 8-day-old TaABC1 transgenic and control plants. After the 200mM NaCl treatment was applied for 5h, the control plants began to show symptoms of salt stress, whereas no signs of stress were shown on TaABC1 plants. MSI determinations showed that the cell membrane stability of TaABC1 plants was 12-16% higher than that of the control plants (Fig. 2C), and the difference was highly significant (P <0.01).. . Fig. 2.. . Salt and osmotic tolerance of 35S-TaABC1, wild-type (WT), and vector control (VC) plants. (A) NaCl effects on newly germinated seedling growth. 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC seeds were planted on MS medium for germination. Five days after germination, seedlings from each line were carefully transferred to a new MS medium containing 100mM and 200mM NaCl. Photographs of representative seedlings of 35S-TaABC1, WT, and VC plants were taken after 10d of growth in the treatment medium. (B) NaCl dose-response analysis of post-germinative growth (green cotyledons). Results were scored at 10d on MS medium containing 200mM NaCl. Values are the mean SD (triplicate measurements; n=15). (C) Cell membrane stability measurement of 35S-TaABC1, WT, and VC plants under 200mM NaCl treatment. Values are the mean SD (triplicate measurements; n=20). (D) Mannitol effects on newly germinated seedling growth. 35S-TaABC1, WT, and VC seeds were germinated for 5d on MS medium and then transferred to a new MS medium containing 200mM and 300mM manntiol for an additional 10d of growth. Representative seedlings are shown. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . To determine further if TaABC1 was involved in the response to salt stress or general osmotic effect stress, 5-day-old seedlings grown on MS medium were transferred to MS medium with 200mM and 300mM mannitol (an osmotic agent) for 10d. The growth of control plants on plates containing different concentrations of mannitol was slightly inhibited compared with 35S-TaABC1 plants (Fig. 2D), suggesting that TaABC1 is involved in a general osmotic response to salt.. . . Drought response of TaABC1-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants. To characterize the performance of 35S-TaABC1 plants under drought stress, 7-day-old 35S-TaABC1, wild-type, and vector control plants were grown in soil for an additional 4 weeks (initial stage of drought stress). Thereafter, plants were not watered for 15d (late stage of drought stress) to induce drought stress. The plants were then rewatered after 3d (Fig. 3A). Before rewatering, the wilting levels of wild-type plants and vector control plants were more obvious than those of the 35S-TaABC1 plants. After rewatering, 49-80% of 35S-TaABC1 plants survived, whereas the corresponding survival rates were 25% for wild-type plants and 11% for vector control plants (Fig. 3B).. . Fig. 3.. . Responses to drought of 35S-TaABC1, wild-type (WT), and vector control (VC) plants. (A) Drought tolerance assays of 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE2, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC plants. One-week-old 35S-TaABC1, WT, and VC plants, were transplanted to soil for an additional 4 weeks (initial stage of drought stress). Thereafter, plants continued to be not watered for 15d (late stage of drought stress) to induce drought stress. Photographs of representative seedlings of 35S-TaABC1, WT, and VC plants were taken at the initial stage of drought stress, late stage of drought stress, and 3d after rewatering. (B) Quantitative analysis of survival of 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE2, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC plants 3d after rewatering. Values are the mean SD (triplicate measurements; n=20 plants). (C) Water loss rates of 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE2, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC plants. Detached leaves from 4-week-old plants grown on soil were left on the laboratory bench (humidity, 45-50%, 20-22C) and weighed at various time points after detachment. The proportions of fresh weight loss were calculated relative to the initial plant weights. Values are mean SD (n=10 plants). (D) Relative water contents of 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE2, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC plants. Detached leaves from 4-week-old plants grown on soil were left on the laboratory bench (humidity, 45-50%, 20-22C) and weighed at various time points after detachment. The plants were finally dried for 24h at 80C to a constant dry weight (DW). Relative water contents were measured according to the formula: RWC (%)=(desiccated weight-DW)/(FW-DW). Values are mean SD (n=10 plants). (E) Osmotic potential (OP) measurement of 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE2, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC plants. Values are the mean SD (triplicate measurements; n=20 plants). (F) Photochemical efficiency measurement of 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE2, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC plants. One-week-old 35S-TaABC1, WT, and VC plants, were transplanted to soil for an additional 22d and 28d (normal conditions and moderate drought stress conditions) prior to measuring photochemical efficiencies (Fv/Fm). Values are the mean SD (triplicate measurements; n=20 plants). (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . To assess the water retention ability of 35S-TaABC1 plants, FW losses in detached rosette leaves were measured. The FW loss of detached rosette leaves in 35S-TaABC1 transgenic plants was <38%, as opposed to 49% and 50% for wild-type and vector control plants, respectively (Fig. 3C). The final RWCs of the 35S-TaABC1 plants were significantly higher than those of the control plants (Fig. 3D). This suggests that the 35S-TaABC1 plants possess higher water retention ability than wild-type and vector control plants.. An OP assay was undertaken to assess the osmotic adjustment ability of 35S-TaABC1 plants. The OP of 35S-TaABC1 transgenic plants was significantly higher than those of control plants, and there was no significant difference between the two controls (Fig. 3E). Overexpression of TaABC1 apparently led to enhanced OP.. To evaluate further the photosynthetic activity of 35S-TaABC1 plants, 1-week-old 35S-TaABC1, wild-type, and vector control plants were transplanted to soil and grown for an additional 22d and 28d (approximately normal conditions and moderate drought stress conditions, respectively), and the maximum photochemistry efficiencies of PSII (Fv/Fm) were measured. Under normal conditions, there were no evident differences between 35S-TaABC1 plants and the controls in Fv/Fm ratio. Under moderate drought stress conditions, Chl fluorescence values showed that the Fv/Fm ratios of the 35S-TaABC1 plants were significantly higher than those of the control plants (P <0.01) (Fig. 3F).. . . Salt response of TaABC1-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants. To examine further salt stress responses of TaABC1 transgenics, 35S-TaABC1 and control plants were grown in potted soil for 4 weeks, and then soaked with 350mM NaCl solution. About 3d after NaCl treatment, the control plants withered, whereas the leaves of transgenic plants were still green. Ten days later, signs of salt stress were evident; 35S-TaABC1 plants were much less affected than the control plants (Fig. 4A). The survival rates of TaABC1 transgenics were much higher than those of the controls (Fig. 4B).. . Fig. 4.. . Responses to salt of 35S-TaABC1, wild-type (WT), and vector control (VC) plants. (A) Four-week-old 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC plants were irrigated with NaCl solution (350mM); free NaCl solution was removed and the plants were cultured under normal conditions. Photographs of representative seedlings were taken 3d and 10d after treatment. (B) Quantitative analysis of 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC plant survival 10d after 350mM NaCl treatment. Values are the mean SD (triplicate measurements; n=20 plants). (C) Chl contents in leaves before or after 350mM NaCl treatment for 18h. Values are the mean SD of triplicate measurements. (D) ROS production in leaves of 35S-TaABC1 and WT plants. Four-week-old detached leaves were stained with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). The photographs are representative leaves from three independent experiments. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . The Chl contents of 35S-TaABC1 and control plants were measured before and after 350mM NaCl treatment. There were no significant differences in Chl content between 35S-TaABC1 and control plants under normal conditions but, 18h after 350mM NaCl treatment, Chl contents of all plants were reduced and leaf Chl contents of the control plants decreased more rapidly than those of the 35S-TaABC1 plants (P <0.01) (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that the retention of stay-green features in 35S-TaABC1 plants was superior to that of the control plants.. Salt stress also leads to an accumulation of high levels of ROS (Van Camp et al., 1996; Borsani et al., 2001). The presence of ROS was further examined with NBT staining for superoxide in the 35S-TaABC1 and control plants with or without salt stress. Under non-salt stress conditions, 35S-TaABC1 and control leaves showed slight NBT staining, indicative of low levels of superoxide (Fig. 4D). However, under stress conditions, the staining levels of control leaves were much higher than in 35S-TaABC1 leaves (Fig. 4D) showing that 35S-TaABC1 plants scavenged superoxide more effectively than the controls.. . . Cold response of TaABC1-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants. Because TaABC1 is also induced by cold (Wang et al., 2007), it was expected that 35S-TaABC1 plants would have altered responses to cold. Four-week-old 35S-TaABC1 and control plants were exposed to -8C for 1.5h. After 1 of recovery under normal conditions, most 35S-TaABC1 plants were phenotypically green, whereas most of the control plants were dead (Fig. 5A); 6-16% of the control plants and 58-69% of the 35S-TaABC1 plants grew normally after recovery (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that TaABC1-overexpressing plants have increased tolerance to freezing stress.. . Fig. 5.. . Responses of 35S-TaABC1, wild-type (WT), and vector control (VC) plants to cold. (A) Four-week-old 35S-TaABC1 (lines OE1, OE4, and OE6), WT, and VC plants were cold stressed at -8C for 2h and then transferred to normal conditions for recovery. Photographs of representative seedlings of 35S-TaABC1, WT, and VC plants were taken after 1d and 6d of recovery. (B) Survival rates were determined as the number of visibly green plants after rehydration. Values are the mean SD (triplicate measurements; n=15 plants). (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . . . Expression of stress-responsive genes in TaABC1-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of TaABC1 in osmotic response, the expression of stress-responsive genes identified in different regulated pathways was monitored by real-time PCR in transgenic Arabidopsis. Under normal conditions, the expression of DREB2A, RD29A, ABF3, KIN1, DREB1B/CBF1, LEA, and P5CS in TaABC1-overexpressing plants was substantially increased compared with wild-type plants, whereas there was no significant induction of expression of DREB1A/CBF3 in either transgenic or wild-type plants (Fig. 6). However, with PEG treatment for 2h, the expressions of the tested marker genes, including DREB1A/CBF3, DREB2A, RD29A, ABF3, KIN1, DREB1B/CBF1, LEA, and P5CS, was up-regulated in both wild-type and transgenic plants. Thus, overexpression of TaABC1 increases expression of stress-responsive genes in Arabidopsis.. . Fig. 6.. . Expression of stress-responsive genes in 35S-TaABC1 and wild-type plants induced by PEG (-1.4MPa) using real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from 2-week-old plants grown under normal or PEG treatment for 2h. Transcript levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR of DREB1A, DREB2A, RD29A, ABF3, KIN1, CBF1, LEA, and P5CS under normal conditions (grey bars) or PEG treatment for 2h (black bars). Actin was used as an internal control. Data represent the mean SD of three replicates..
PMC4194012	Results. . Fluorescent marker lines visualizing female gamete plasma membrane. Arabidopsis aquaporin (plasma membrane intrinsic protein 2A; PIP2a), a water channel protein, has been reported to uniformly label the plasma membrane along the surface of the cell (Cutler et al. 2000). To visualize Arabidopsis egg and central cell plasma membranes, GFP-PIP2a and RFP-PIP2a driven by promoters DD45 (Steffen et al. 2007) and FWA (Kinoshita et al. 2004), which allow egg-cell- and central-cell-specific expression, respectively, were constructed. All the Arabidopsis plants transformed with those constructs were fertile (data not shown).. When the marker lines with GFP-labeled female gamete membrane were observed under TPLSM, the surface of the female gamete was clearly visualized (Fig.1a-c). The egg cell displayed a rounded shape at the chalazal side and a hook-like shape at the micropylar side (Fig.1a). The micropylar side of the central cell extended to the egg cell (Fig.1b, c). The circular empty area within the egg cell and the central cell corresponded to the location of the nucleus (Fig.1a-c, Fig. S1). The double fluorescent marker line by which both female gamete plasma membranes were visualized with GFP was also obtained by crossing the marker lines where each of the female gamete membranes was visualized with GFP (Fig.1c). By projecting a three-dimensional configuration (Movie S1), it was confirmed that the chalazal side of the egg cell surface is closest to the micropylar side of the central cell surface.Fig.1Arabidopsis fluorescent markers visualizing female gamete plasma membrane. a Visualized egg cell plasma membrane by expression of pDD45::sGFP-PIP2a. b Visualized central cell plasma membrane by expression of pFWA::sGFP-PIP2a. c Double fluorescent marker line visualizing both female gamete plasma membranes with GFP. White dot line represents the region where the egg cell surface is closest to the central cell surface. m micropylar side, c chalazal side. A single optical slice image obtained by TPLSM is shown. Asterisks mark positions of nuclei. Scale bars 10mum. . . Relative locations of male and female gametes before fertilization. GCS1, which is also called HAP2, is a fertilization determinant that is localized on the sperm cell surface (Mori et al. 2006; von Besser et al. 2006). A defect of GCS1 caused sperm cell arrest in the embryo sac, resulting in the inhibition of fertilization in Arabidopsis (Mori et al. 2006). To observe in detail the location of sperm cells after their discharge from the pollen tube, a male fluorescent marker line by which the sperm nuclei were visualized with GFP in a heterozygous Arabidopsis GCS1 mutant (+/gcs1) was produced. The obtained marker line was applied to the pollination of the female fluorescent marker lines labeling plasma membrane with GFP. GFP signals of sperm nuclei merging with female gamete plasma membranes were distinguishable due to differences in the signal intensity (Fig.2). The arrested gcs1 sperm nuclei were confirmed to remain at the boundary of the female gametes as suggested in previous studies (Fig.2a) (Hamamura et al. 2011; Mori et al. 2010). Furthermore, the arrested gcs1 sperm nuclei on the egg cell surface adjacent to the central cell showed a flattened shape, whereas no remarkable change of the egg cell surface was observed (Fig.2b).Fig.2Sperm cell locations in an embryo sac before fertilization. a Arrested gcs1 sperm nuclei expressing HTR10-GFP at the boundary of the female gametes (double marker line expressing pDD45::sGFP-PIP2a and pFWA::sGFP-PIP2a).

Arrowheads indicate sperm nuclei. ec egg cell, cc central cell. . . Live cell imaging of sperm cell membrane during double fertilization. After being discharged from a pollen tube, the sperm nuclei remained at the boundary of the female gametes for a while and then resumed movement toward the egg cell or the central cell (Hamamura et al. 2011). The timing of resumption of sperm nucleus movement was considered to be a sign of plasmogamy between male and female gametes in Arabidopsis (Hamamura et al. 2011).. To analyze gamete membrane dynamics during double fertilization, transgenic Arabidopsis expressing GCS1-GFP (GPP) (Mori et al. 2010) was applied as the male gamete membrane marker line for further analysis. GPP specifically labels the sperm cell membrane (plasma membrane and internal membrane components) (Fig. S2). A male double fluorescent marker line expressing both HTR10-mRFP (Ingouff et al. 2007) and GPP, which visualized sperm cell nuclei and membranes, respectively, was also produced and applied to the pollination of the female marker line visualizing the egg cell plasma membrane with RFP (hereafter referred to as EC-RFP-PIP) (Fig.3a-i). At 7-8h after the pollination, ovules, where the double fertilization was progressing, were observed. Immediately before the resumption of sperm nucleus movement, bright GFP signals were noted around the sperm nuclei (Fig.3a-c). After the resumption of sperm nucleus movement, the GFP signals diffused at the boundary of the female gametes and an additional signal was rarely observed around the sperm nucleus within the egg cell or the central cell (Fig.3d-i). In all cases, an apparent GFP signal was observed at the boundary of the female gametes. In order to obtain time-lapse images of the gamete fusion process, the semi in vitro double fertilization assay was performed with the male marker line expressing GPP and the female marker line EC-RFP-PIP. As a result, the GPP-labeled sperm cells moved in opposite directions after being discharged from the pollen tube and seemed to gradually diffuse more or less (Fig.3j-m, Movie S2). In addition, one of the migrating GFP signals merged with the RFP signal, indicating that the sperm cell membrane components entered the egg cell.Fig.3Sperm cell membrane dynamics during double fertilization of Arabidopsis. a-i A double male fluorescent marker expressing both HTR10-mRFP and GPP was applied to the pollination of the female marker line EC-RFP-PIP.

PMC3444272	ResultsHaemoglobin gene expression modulates NO and ethylene emissionTo establish that NO and ethylene emission were under Hb control in Arabidopsis, their release from Arabidopsis wild-type, GLB2 and GLB3 knock-out lines (glb2 and glb3), the GLB1 silencing line (Hg:Glb1), as well as lines overexpressing GLB1 and GLB2 (35S:Glb1 and 35S:Glb2) was measured (Hebelstrup et al., 2006, 2007). The rate of NO emission from whole rosettes was strongly increased in the GLB1 silencing line (Hg:Glb1) and in the glb2 mutant (10- and 4-fold, respectively), whereas in the glb3 mutant line the emission rate was similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 1A). A significantly lower NO emission was measured from the leaves of the 35S:Glb1 and 35S:Glb2 overexpression lines. The rate of ethylene emission, as measured from whole rosettes, was strongly increased in Glb1 silencing (Hg:Glb1) and glb2 mutant lines (~14- and ~2-fold, respectively), whereas the rate of ethylene emission from 35S:Glb1, 35S:Glb2, and the glb3 mutant line was unaltered (Fig. 1B). Similar results were seen when the experiment was repeated for the lines Hg:Glb1, Col-0, 35S:Glb1, and 35S:Glb2 to measure internal ethylene by squeezing leaves from the plants in a syringe and immediately measuring the ethylene content as described by Millenaar et al.

Error bars indicate the SE (n 10).The sensitivity to ethylene was tested by exposing Arabidopsis seedlings to the ethylene precursor ACC in the dark. This classical triple-response assay (Guzman et al., 1990; Kende, 1993; Hua et al., 1998) revealed no differences between the Glb1 overexpression line and Hg:Glb1 compared with the wild type as all were equally sensitive to hypocotyl growth inhibition by ACC (Fig. 1C). As expected, the ethylene insensitive-2 (ein2) mutant, used as a negative control, was insensitive to ACC.These results indicate that GLB1 and GLB2 but not GLB3 control NO and ethylene emission rates in Arabidopsis. Moreover, Arabidopsis Hb controls ethylene release without altering ethylene sensitivity.NO emission and formation of S-nitrosothiols increase under hypoxia and are controlled by haemoglobinOnline measurements of NO emission were derived from Arabidopsis rosette leaves incubated at a range of low (0-1%) oxygen concentrations in the dark (Fig. 2). At 1% oxygen (Fig. 2A), the rate of NO emission from wild-type plants was similar to that observed at normal oxygen concentrations (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the NO emission rate increased rapidly when the plants were incubated at 0.43% oxygen (100-fold increase after 60min) (Fig. 2B). When oxygen concentrations were gradually lowered, the NO emission rates of wild-type plants became progressively higher (Fig. 2C, 2D, 2F). When the 0.1% oxygen treatment was continued overnight, it was observed that this rate of NO emission was maintained for >21h of hypoxia (results not shown).Fig. 2. NO emission from Glb1 overexpression (35S:Glb1, filled circles), wild type (Col-0, open diamonds), and silencing lines (Hg:Glb1, crosses) under hypoxia at 1% O2 (A), 0.43% O2 (B), 0.3% O2 (C), 0.1% O2 (D), and anoxia (E). Arabidopsis rosettes were placed in dark cuvettes and flushed with gas mixtures of O2 and N2 or pure N2 (0% O2). Bars indicate the SD. The rate of NO production after 60min at different oxygen concentrations is shown in (F) where data points are taken from (A-E). (G and H) S-Nitrosothiol (-SNO groups) levels in Arabidopsis rosette leaves with Hb silencing (Hg:Glb1), overexpression (35S:Glb1), or the wild type (Col-0) under normoxic conditions (G) or after 24h hypoxic (0.1% O2) treatment (H). Error bars indicate the SD. Significant differences from the wild type: **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05. NS, not significant. Note the 1000-fold different scales on the y-axis of G and H.Under hypoxia, Hg:Glb1 silenced plants showed higher NO emission rates compared with the wild type (Fig. 2B-D, F). This effect was strongest under anoxic (0% O2) conditions, where rates of production were >500 times those observed under normoxia (21% O2) and 4-fold that of wild-type plants (Figs 1A, 2E). Consistent with a role for GLB1 in inhibiting NO formation under hypoxia, 35S:Glb1 showed significantly lower rates of NO emission than the wild type at 0.1-0.43% oxygen (Fig. 2B-D), however, not under anoxia (Fig. 2E, 2F) where NO production did not significantly differ from that of wild-type plants.One well-established means through which NO can rapidly modify protein function is via S-nitrosylation (Astier et al., 2011). Thus, total S-nitrosothiol content was measured after 24h of oxygen depletion (0.1% oxygen). The total S-nitrosothiol content was increased ~1000-fold in oxygen-depleted tissues compared with normoxic tissues (Fig. 2G, 2H). Hg:Glb1 silenced plants accumulated more S-nitrosothiols during both normoxia and hypoxia, whereas 35S:Glb1 plants accumulated less (Fig. 2G, 2H). These observations correlated with the NO emission rates under identical experimental conditions (Figs 1A, 2D).Fig. 3. Gene expression of Glb1 and Glb2 in wild-type plants under waterlogging of the roots. Top, shoots; bottom, roots in cases of both non-flooded plants (open bars) and plants with permanently flooded roots (hatched bars) of the accessions C24 and Col-0. Note the log scale on the y-axis for both figure parts. Error bars indicate the SE.Haemoglobin expression under waterlogging conditionsIn nature, a hypoxic environment is often experienced in roots during waterlogging (Agarwal et al., 2006). Therefore, experiments were conducted to test whether Hb expression was modulated in roots and/or shoots of Arabidopsis plants exposed to waterlogged conditions, where only the roots were submerged in water. GLB1 expression was increased (>10-fold) in the shoot as well as in the root (Fig. 3) in both the relatively flooding-tolerant C24 accession and the less tolerant, standard Col-0 accession (Vashisht et al., 2011). This shows that GLB1 expresssion in the shoots responded to flooding, even when only the roots are flooded. No significant differences were found in GLB1 expression between the two accessions Col-0 and C24. It should be noted that GLB2 expression levels were only slightly increased in the roots, whereas no change was observed in the shoots. This suggests that GLB2 gene expression plays no role in modulating responses to anoxia.Haemoglobin modulates leaf movement in response to ethyleneTo relate Hb effects to a mechanism of avoiding the effects of flooding, the effects of Hb expression on hyponastic growth, which is a prominent flooding escape response induced by ethylene (Millenaar et al., 2005, 2009; Van Zanten et al., 2010), were examined. Ethylene induced a hyponastic response with maximum leaf angle after ~12h in wild-type plants (Fig. 4A). In the Hg:Glb1 silenced line, the amplitude of the leaf movement response was further increased compared with wild-type controls and the maximum angle was observed 22h after the start of treatment (Fig. 4C). As a slightly increased response was noted in 35S:Glb1 (Fig. 4B), it seems likely that there are Hb/NO-independent mechanisms of hyponastic regulation. To test if hyponasty is affected by oxygen depletion, wild-type Col-0 plants were subjected to an anoxic environment. However, the plants were under light and therefore able to photosynthesize during the experiment. Consequently, the petioles were probably not completely anoxic in these conditions (Lee et al., 2011). In the absence of additional ethylene, a modest increase in leaf angle compared with normoxic (21% O2) control plants was observed (Fig. 4D). Beyond 13h, the plants could not maintain high leaf angles and exhibited severe wilting (not shown). A 5% O2 treatment also resulted in a modest increase in petiole angle, but this was now maintained for at least 24h (Fig. 4E). In the presence of ethylene, 5% O2-treated plants showed a strongly increased hyponastic growth response (~10  more) compared with ethylene-treated plants under normoxic conditions, which was maintained for at least 24h (Fig. 4F). The 5% oxygen is above the threshold level at which increased NO formation was measured (Fig. 2). These data therefore indicate that the effect of hypoxia is additive to ethylene-induced hyponastic growth and partially independent of increased NO formation.Fig. 4.

PMC2478689	Results. Microarray analysis of PPV-infected Arabidopsis leaf tissues identified 2013 and 1457 genes that were significantly (Q  0.05) up- ( 2.5 fold) and downregulated ( -2.5 fold), respectively. Genes associated with soluble sugar, starch and amino acid, intracellular membrane/membrane-bound organelles, chloroplast, and protein fate were upregulated, while genes related to development/storage proteins, protein synthesis and translation, and cell wall-associated components were downregulated. These gene expression changes were associated with PPV infection and symptom development. Further transcriptional profiling of protoplasts transfected with a PPV infectious clone revealed the upregulation of defence and cellular signalling genes as early as 6 hours post transfection. A cross sequence comparison analysis of genes differentially regulated by PPV-infected Arabidopsis leaves against uniEST sequences derived from PPV-infected leaves of Prunus persica, a natural host of PPV, identified orthologs related to defence, metabolism and protein synthesis. The cross comparison of genes differentially regulated by PPV infection and by the infections of other positive sense RNA viruses revealed a common set of 416 genes. These identified genes, particularly the early responsive genes, may be critical in virus infection..
PMC4809284	ResultsExpression of PME genes during seed developmentOn the basis of public transcriptomic data (http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi), seven PME genes expressed in seed tegument were selected (At1g11590, At1g23200, At2g43050, At4g03930, At4g33220, At5g49180, and At5g53370). The expression of these genes was analysed by qRT-PCR on total RNA extracted from Arabidopsis siliques harvested at various developmental stages and from vegetative organs. The results confirmed that these seven PMEs are expressed in siliques, as shown previously in another study (Levesque-Tremblay et al., 2015a). In particular, At1g11590, At1g23200, At4g03930, and At5g49180 are specifically expressed in siliques with very low expression in other organs, such as roots, stem, or leaves (Fig. 1). Of all the PMEs tested, At5g49180 showed the strongest expression level in siliques, with its transcription peaking at early stages of seed development between 3 and 6 days after flowering (Fig. 1). Interestingly, At5g49180 is also expressed in seed upon imbibition (Scheler et al. 2015). Based upon these transcriptomic data, the decision was made to focus on At5g49180, named PME58, to characterize its biological function through a classic reverse genetics approach.Fig. 1.Relative expression of At1g11590, At1g23200, At2g43050, At4g03930, At4g33220, At5g49180, and At5g53370 genes in roots, stem, leaves, flower buds (FB), and siliques at stages 3-4 to >15 days after flowering (DAF). Gene expressions were measured using three stably expressed reference genes (EF1alpha, CLATHRIN, APT1) in two biological samples with similar results. Only results obtained with EF1alpha are shown. The presented data correspond to the mean  SD of two replicates of a biological sample. This figure is available in colour at JXB online.. pme58 mutants present a mucilage phenotypeSeveral T-DNA insertion lines affected in the expression of PME58 were selected and two homozygous mutant alleles were obtained. These two mutants were named pme58-1 and pme58-2 and contained a T-DNA insert in the first exon of the PME58 coding sequence (Fig. 2A). No PME58 transcript was detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 2A) on either of these lines.Fig. 2.Characterization of T-DNA insertion lines pme58-1 and pme58-2.

(B) RR staining of adherent mucilage of wild-type and mutant seeds. Bars = 200 m. Mucilage remaining around seeds was visualized by RR after extraction in 50mM EDTA pH 8. (C) Scanning electron micrographs of the surface of wild-type and pme58-1 mature dry seeds. (D) Epidermal cell surface area (mum2), data represent the means  SE of 600 values obtained on three biological repeats. Significant differences were determined with the parametric T-test (***P < 0.001). (E) Sections of mature wild-type and pme58-1 seeds stained with 0.1% toluidine blue.In a first attempt to identify a phenotype, the effect on mucilage extrusion of these two mutant alleles was characterized by RR staining on either liquid or solid medium. The results indicated that pme58 mutants show a slight phenotype, in that their adherent mucilage layer shows less staining by RR than that of the wild-type Col-0 line, suggesting a possible modification of their mucilage structure. An attempt was then made to characterize the phenotype of pme58 mutants more precisely.Arabidopsis adherent mucilage contains a large amount of pectins, mostly RG-I as well as a small amount of HGs. It has been shown that pre-treatment of mucilage with divalent cation chelators, such as EDTA or EGTA, increases the thickness of this adherent layer (Willats et al., 2001). This indicates that the formation of calcium bridges linking the acidic pectic fractions of adherent mucilage plays a role in its molecular structure. To further characterize the adherent mucilage phenotype of pme58 mutants, their seeds were pre-treated with EDTA prior to RR staining. In these conditions, the adherent mucilage of the pme58 mutant lines was less stained than that of the wild-type Col-0 (Fig. 2B).Mucilage is produced in the most external layer of the seed coat. Because PME proteins are located in the plant cell wall, it is possible that the mucilage-producing cell structure is affected in the pme58 lines. The structure of mutant seed coat epidermal cells was therefore examined in more detail by SEM and toluidine blue staining on mature dry seeds. The epidermal cells of both wild-type and pme58 mutant seeds had the same morphology, with a characteristic polygonal form and a central columella (Fig. 2C, E). As shown in Fig. 2C, E, the epidermal cells of mutant seeds were smaller than those of wild-type seeds. These observations were confirmed by measuring epidermal cell areas on three biological repeats; they were indeed significantly smaller in pme58-1 mutants (Fig. 2D) and pme58-2 mutants (data not shown). So, even if the structure of the epidermal cells of the pme58 seed coat appears unchanged, a mutation in PME58 seems to have an effect on epidermal cell size.Finally, because PME seed activity plays a role in germination (Mller et al., 2013; Scheler et al., 2015), and because PME58 is strongly expressed in seeds, germination assays were performed under normal and water-limiting conditions after cold stratification. In these conditions, there was no difference in germination between wild-type and pme58 mutant seeds (Supplementary Fig. S1). We cannot exclude the possibility that seed stratification masks a light effect of pme58 on germination.. PME58 is specifically expressed in mucilage secretory cellsBecause pme58 mutants have a mucilage phenotype (Fig. 2B), PME58 expression was examined to determine whether it is specifically expressed in the seed coat. The activity of the PME58 promoter was assessed by studying plants transformed with a pPME58::eGFP:GUS construct. As expected, GUS staining showed that the promoter activity of PME58 is located in the seed coat of young siliques (Fig. 3A) and particularly in the epidermal cells of the seed coat that produce mucilage (Fig. 3B). Moreover, fluorescence of the eGFP protein showed that PME58 is specifically expressed in mucilage secretory cells (MSCs) of the young seed coat (Fig. 3C, D).Fig. 3.Promoter activity of PME58. (A, B) Histochemical GUS staining of pPME58:GUS:eGFP transgenic plants are shown for siliques at stage 2-3 days after flowering (DAF). (C, D) Confocal laser scanning microscopic analyses of pPME58:GUS:eGFP transgenic plants are shown for seed from 7-8 DAF siliques.PME activity and HG methylesterification is modified in pme58 mucilageBecause RR is specific to acidic pectins, the decrease in staining observed in pme58 mutant adherent mucilage after EDTA pre-treatment could indicate a modification of HG methylesterification connected to a decrease in PME activity. Soluble and adherent mucilage were extracted separately on wild-type and pme58 lines and a PME activity assay was performed on both fractions (Fig. 4A). The measured PME activity was lower in pme58 adherent mucilage than in the wild type. More surprisingly, PME activity increased in soluble mucilage extracted from the mutant lines. It must be noted that PME activity in the wild type was present in both adherent and soluble mucilage fractions, which are almost equivalent. The difference in PME activity observed in the pme58 mutant was therefore a direct effect of the mutation. There was no difference between wild-type and mutant lines when PME activity was measured using proteins extracted from demucilaged seeds, confirming that PME58 activity was strictly present in the mucilage-producing cells.Fig. 4.PME activity and DM in wild-type and pme58 mutants. (A) Relative PME activity in adherent mucilage, soluble mucilage, and whole seed determined by gel diffusion. (B) Homogalacturonan DM (%) of adherent mucilage. All experiments were performed in triplicate on three biological repeats. Values were obtained from three individual measurements. Data represent the means  SE of 27 values. Significant differences were determined with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (*P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001).The DM of HGs present in the adherent mucilage was measured on the pme58 mutant lines and compared to the wild-type lines (Fig. 4B). As expected, the DM was slightly increased in the mutant lines, which had decreased PME activity due to the abolished expression of the PME58 gene. Although this difference in DM was weak, it was statistically significant.Modulation of PME58 activity has an impact on mucilage extractabilityFrom the RR staining phenotype observed after mucilage extraction using EDTA (see Fig. 2B), it appears that PME58 activity could influence the molecular structure of the seed mucilage through the modulation of HG DM and its impact on the formation of calcium bridges between HG polymers. It has been shown that HGs demethylesterified by processive PMEs are able to form an egg-box structure through calcium ions binding to the free carboxyl groups generated by this activity, leading to the stiffening of the cell wall pectic structure. Seed mucilage calcium chelation using EDTA has a large impact on the extraction of HGs present in its adherent layer. This can be evidenced by whole seed immunodetection using LM19 antibodies, which preferentially recognize un-esterified HGs (Verhertbruggen et al., 2009).When wild-type seed mucilage was extracted with water, the LM19-specific signal was located at the bottom of the adherent mucilage layer, close to the seed coat surface, as shown by the columella located at the centre of each mucilage-producing cell (Figs 5A and 6A). When seed mucilage was extracted using an EDTA solution, the LM19 signal dispersed to the upper part of the adherent mucilage layer, indicating that the basal location of HGs is highly dependent on the formation of egg-box structures (Figs 5B and 6B). To further study the impact of PME58 activity on the structure of the seed coat mucilage, the free sugar compositions of adherent and soluble mucilage were compared between the wild-type and pme58 mutant lines after extraction with water or an EDTA solution (Fig. 5C-F). When extracted with water, no difference in mucilage sugar (neutral and acidic) composition could be seen between wild-type and pme58 mutant lines, in either soluble (Fig. 5C) or adherent (Fig. 5D) mucilage. In both cases, most of the sugars were rhamnose or galacturonic acid, because Arabidopsis mucilage contains mainly RG-I. As expected from previously published results, traces of arabinose, glucose, fructose, and galactose were also detected (Dean et al., 2007; Macquet et al., 2007; Saez-Aguayo et al., 2013; Voiniciuc et al., 2013; North et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2014). However, when extracted with an EDTA solution, mucilage sugar composition was clearly different between wild-type and pme58 mutant lines, for both soluble and adherent fractions (Fig. 5E, F). In EDTA-extracted soluble mucilage, higher levels of all the detected sugars were present in the pme58 mutant lines than in the wild type (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, the opposite was seen for the EDTA-extracted adherent mucilage (Fig. 5F). In this case, all the detected sugars were present in lower amounts in the mutant lines than in the wild type. Moreover, the amount of sugar extracted using EDTA was higher than the amount extracted with water, probably indicating that EDTA treatment results in the extraction of pectic sugars not only from mucilage but also from the cell wall of the mucilage-producing cells. Taken together, these results indicate that, upon EDTA extraction, sugars are more easily transferred from the adherent layer to the soluble mucilage fraction in the pme58 mutant lines, evidencing that PME58 activity participates in the structuration of the mucilage adherent layer.Fig. 5.Organization and monosaccharide composition of mucilage extracted in water or EDTA.

All experiments were performed in triplicate on three biological repeats. Data represent the means  SE of nine values.

Water-extracted soluble mucilage seeds (A, B, C) were then incubated in 50mM EDTA pH 8 for 1h (D, E, F) before labelling with LM19 (green) and Calcofluor (magenta). Seeds were from either the wild type (A, D), pme58-1 (B, E), or pme58-2 (C, F). Bars = 10 m. AM, adherent mucilage; C, columella.PME58 activity modulates molecular interactions with HGs in the mucilage adherent layerModulation of the extractability of mucilage in the pme58 mutants seems to indicate that modification of the DM of HGs present in its adherent layer can influence the molecular interactions between the mucilage components during its extrusion. Immunodetection assays were therefore performed on the mucilage adherent layer to study the effect of PME58 activity on HG location upon mucilage extrusion in different experimental conditions. Following mucilage extrusion in water, the soluble layer was eliminated and immunolabelling was performed on the adherent layer using the LM19 antibody. As expected, the LM19 signal in the wild type was located at the basal of the mucilage adherent layer, close to the seed coat surface (Fig. 6A). However, when the experiment was performed in the same conditions on both the pme58 mutant lines (Fig. 6B, C), the LM19 signals were found in the upper portion of the adherent layer, clearly above the tip of the columella surface. The experiment was performed several times on different seed samples, giving the same result. When the labelling experiment was performed after mucilage water extraction and elimination of the soluble layer immediately followed by EDTA treatment on only the adherent layer, the LM19 signals were again found to have shifted to an upper position in the mucilage adherent layer of the wild type (compare Fig. 6A, D). In contrast, this additional EDTA treatment had no effect on the LM19 labelling in either pme58 mutant line (Fig. 6E, F). The same set of experiments was performed using antibodies recognizing other HG epitopes: in the same conditions described for Fig. 6, immunolabelling was performed with the LM20 antibody (which binds to moderately and highly methylesterified HGs) and 2F4 antibody (which binds to HG egg-box structures), and no differences were observed between wild type and mutants in either mucilage extraction condition (see Supplementary Figs S2 and S3 at JXB online). These results indicate that PME58 activity participates in the regulation of interactions between HGs and other polymers (probably RG-I) present in the mucilage adherent layer during extrusion..
PMC2955748	Results. . The coi1-16 mutant shows reduced response to ACC-induced root growth inhibition. Seedlings of Arabidopsis accession Col gl (wild-type) and the mutant coi1-16 were grown in CL on media containing a range of compounds at concentrations that inhibit root growth, including MeJA, ACC, EBR, SA, and the cytokinin BAP, and their root growth was compared. coi1-16 displayed significantly less response than the wild-type to root growth inhibition induced by MeJA and by ACC (Figs 1, 2A). These results suggest that COI1 is required for part of the ACC-induced root growth inhibition and for most if not all of the MeJA-induced root growth inhibition. The role of COI1 on root growth in response to ACC was investigated.. . Fig. 1.. . Effect of various root growth inhibitors on coi1-16.

The scale bar indicates 5mm.. . . . . . ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition is via ethylene and does not require JA biosynthesis and perception. ACC is the direct precursor of ethylene. Tests were therefore carried out to determine whether ethylene had similar effects to ACC on root growth of wild-type and coi1-16 seedlings. Ethylene, like ACC, induced root growth inhibition in the wild-type but to a lesser extent in coi1-16 (54.4% root growth for the wild-type and 69.5% for coi1-16, P <0.05). This suggests that the reduced response of coi1-16 to ACC is due to its reduced response to ethylene.. COI1 is required for most JA responses reported, including JA-induced root growth inhibition. If ethylene enhanced JA biosynthesis, as is found in tomato (Sivasankar et al., 2000), then this could account for the reduced response of coi1-16 to ACC-induced root growth inhibition. To test this possibility, experiments were conducted to examine whether ACC also inhibited root growth in the JA biosynthesis mutants allene oxide synthase (aos) (Park et al., 2002; von Malek et al., 2002) and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (opr3) (Stintzi and Browse, 2000). Both mutants showed a wild-type (Col gl for aos, and Ws-0 for opr3) response to ACC-induced root growth inhibition (Table 1). This indicates that JA synthesis is not required for the ACC-induced, COI1-mediated response. JASMONATE RESISTANT1 (JAR1) (Staswick et al., 1998) encodes a JA-amido synthetase which catalyses the formation of biologically active JA-Ile conjugate (Staswick and Tiryaki, 2004), and JASMONATE INSENSITIVE1 (JIN1) (Berger et al., 1996) encodes an ATMYC2 transcriptional activator (Lorenzo et al., 2004). The mutants jar1-1 and jin1 showed a wild-type response to ACC-induced root growth inhibition (Table 1). This indicates that COI1, but not JAR1 or JIN1, is required for response to ACC.. .

Root lengths of treated seedlings compared with that of control seedlings are expressed as the mean of relative root growth  SE (%). Those genotypes showing significant differences (P <0.05) between light and dark treatments are indicated with asterisks. Data from wild-type controls, which correspond to specific experiments for each mutant, are indicated with matching alphabetical letters. If the gene is/is not required in each light condition this is indicated as +/-.. . . . . . Light is required for ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition. COI1 is required for part of ACC- and ethylene-induced root growth inhibition. Experiments were therefore carried out to investigate whether the ethylene receptor ETR1 was also required for this response. A dominant mutant, etr1-1, was less responsive to ACC-induced root growth inhibition in continuous darkness (CD), as reported (Chang et al., 1993), but was only marginally less responsive than the wild-type in the light (Table 1; Figs 2B, 3A). In contrast, coi1-16 had a wild-type response to ACC in the dark (Table 1; Fig. 3A) as reported (Ellis and Turner, 2002). To test whether COI1 and ETR1 contributed additively to the ACC-induced, light-dependent root growth inhibition, the etr1-1;coi1-16 double mutant was constructed. etr1-1;coi1-16 showed reduced response to MeJA both in the light and in the dark, and was unresponsiveness to ACC in the dark (Fig. 3A), as expected from the phenotypes of the parental single mutants. However, the double mutant was less responsive than either coi1-16 or etr1-1 to ACC in terms of root growth in the light (Table 1; Figs 2B, 3A). This shows that the coi1-16 and etr1-1 mutations contribute additively to unresponsiveness to ACC in the light. Since this coi1-16 mutant line, from which the double mutant was constructed, was later found to contain a second mutation, pen2 (Westphal et al., 2008), seedlings containing a single coi1-16 mutant allele were treated with silver thiosulphate (STS) solution to inhibit ethylene perception in the light. STS restored root growth of ACC-treated wild-type and coi1-16 to 62.33.0% and 85.03.1%, respectively. Evidently, in the light, when the ethylene signalling is abolished by the etr1 mutation, or by silver ions, there remains a response to ethylene which requires COI1.. . Fig. 3.. .

An additional interaction between COI1 and ETR1 was observed: on media containing MeJA, and in the dark, the percentage germination of the wild-type, etr1-1, and etr1-1;coi1-16 was 96, 3.3, and 86.7%, respectively (Table 2). A similar, though less extreme, pattern was observed in the light. Evidently, the ability of ETR1 to bind ethylene and, in turn, activation of its downstream pathway, antagonises the effect of JA-induced, COI1-mediated germination inhibition.. . Table 2.. .

Seedlings were grown for 7d in CD or CL on MS agar supplemented with 50muM MeJA or 4muM ACC. At least 15 seeds were sown per genotype. The germination ratio is shown as a percentage (%).. . . . . . COI1 is not required for ACC-induced root hair elongation or gene expression. Exogenous ethylene or ACC increases the number and length of root hairs in Arabidopsis, in the light and in the dark (Tanimoto et al., 1995). Tests were conducted to determine whether this response required COI1. ACC induced root hair elongation in both wild-type and coi1-16 seedlings in the light and in the dark (Fig. 3B, data not shown). In contrast, etr1-1 and etr1-1;coi1-16 seedlings showed no visible root hair elongation in the presence or absence of ACC (Fig. 3B). The ethylene-insensitive mutants listed in Table 1 were germinated in the light and in the dark on MS and on ACC. All had shorter root hairs compared with the wild-type, except ein4, as previously reported (Cho and Cosgrove, 2002) (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light requires both the COI1 and ETR1 pathways, whereas ACC-induced root hair elongation requires the ETR1 pathway but not the COI1 pathway.. Expression of ethylene-responsive genes was also investigated in coi1-16. Genes that are induced by ethylene but not differentially regulated by JAs were selected according to a previous report (Hua et al., 1998) and Genevestigator (Hruz et al., 2008). Seedlings were grown in the light on MS and on ACC for 7d, and expression of ETR2 and ERS2 was determined by qRT-PCR. In the wild-type, ETR2 and ERS2 were induced >2-fold by ACC (Fig. 4). In coi1-16, induction was marginally less compared with that of the wild-type (Fig. 4); however, the difference was not statistically significant, indicating that COI1 is not required for ACC-induced expression of ETR2 and ERS2.. . Fig. 4.. . Ethylene-responsive gene expression in the wild-type and coi1-16. Seedlings were grown for 7d in continuous light (CL) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar supplemented or not with 4muM ACC. Ten to 15 seedlings were harvested per sample and three biological replicates were tested for gene expression of ETR2 and ERS2. The average expression ratios of ACC-treated samples to controls are expressed in a log2 scale. Bars indicate the standard error (SE).. . . . . . Involvement of other ethylene perception-response components in ACC-induced, light-dependent root growth inhibition. To identify other ethylene perception-response genes involved in ACC-induced, light-dependent, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition, a range of mutants was tested for light-induced response to ACC (Table 1). The reasoning behind this was that if the mutations defined genes that were in the signalling pathway for ACC-induced, light-dependent, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition, then the mutant plants would show less response to ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light than in the dark; that is, their phenotype would be similar in this respect to that of the coi1-16 mutant. The ethylene receptor mutants, ers1-1, ers2-1, etr2-1, and ein4 were less responsive to ACC than the wild-type, both in the light and in the dark, and were less responsive to ACC in the dark than in the light, similar to etr1-1. The constitutive ethylene response mutant ctr1-1 was partially responsive to ACC in the dark and in the light. ein2-1 and ein3-1 were less responsive to ACC than the wild-type in the light and in the dark, and were less responsive to ACC in the dark than in the light. A transgenic line overexpressing ERF1, 35S::ERF1, showed a slightly enhanced response to ACC to a similar extent in the light and in the dark, suggesting the existence of a positive feedback of this pathway. These results suggest that ERF1 could be required for both ACC-induced COI1-mediated and ETR1-mediated root growth inhibition pathways, whereas ETR2, EIN4, ERS1, ERS2, EIN2, EIN3, and possibly CTR1 are on the same pathway as ETR1.. Results in Fig. 3A show that the etr1-1;coi1-16 double mutant was less responsive to ACC-induced root growth inhibition than the single mutants. The double mutants ers1-1;coi1-16, ers2-1;coi1-16, ein2-1;coi1-16, and ein3-1;coi1-16 also showed less response than the single parental mutants to ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light (Table 1). These results indicate that COI1 functions additively with the known ethylene signalling pathway in ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light. The double mutant ctr1-1;coi1-16 was severely stunted and infertile.. . . ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition is independent of individual photoreceptors, but dependent on photoperiods. The results indicate that ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition requires light. To investigate whether the known photoreceptors were required, photoreceptor mutants were tested for ACC-induced root growth inhibition in the light. These included the far-red/red light receptor mutants, phytochromeA (phyA) and phyB, and the UV-A/blue light receptor mutants, cryptochrome1 (cry1), cry2, phototropin1 (phot1) and phot2, the double mutants cry1;cry2 and phot1;phot2, and the quadruple mutant cry1;cry2;phot1;phot2. All of the tested mutants showed a wild-type response to ACC in the light (data not shown).. These results indicate that none of the known photoreceptors appears to be individually required for ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition. Therefore, the effect of different photoperiods, including CD, short day (SD, 8/16h light/dark), long day (LD, 16/8h light/dark) and CL, on ACC-induced root growth inhibition of the wild-type and coi1-16 was examined (Table 3). coi1-16 showed significantly less response (P <0.001) to ACC than the wild-type in CL and LD (Table 3). coi1-16 was significantly less responsive than the wild-type to MeJA-induced root growth inhibition in all light conditions, and a tendency for a greater response to MeJA in the longer photoperiods was suggested (Table 3).. .

Root lengths of treated seedlings compared with that of control seedlings are expressed as the mean of relative root growth SE (%, n 12).. . . . . . MeJA and ACC inhibit root cell elongation. MeJA and ACC inhibit root growth in light-grown seedlings, wholly or partially through COI1. To investigate whether this was through reducing cell elongation or reducing cell division, seedlings were grown for 7d in the light on MS agar containing each inhibitor, and the lengths of mature root epidermal cells were measured under a brightfield microscope. Treatment of wild-type seedlings with MeJA reduced mature cell length and root length to 46.7% and 26.3% of those of controls, respectively (Table 4). Therefore, the reduction in cell length could account for 72% of the observed reduction in root length. In contrast, treatment of coi1-16 seedlings with MeJA reduced mature cell length only to 92.1% of that of controls, although root length was reduced to 79.1%. This means that the reduction in cell length could only account for 38% of the observed reduction in root length, indicating that COI1 plays a major role in the MeJA-induced inhibition of cell elongation. Treatment of wild-type seedlings with ACC reduced cell length and root length to 48.0% and 56.2% of those of controls, respectively, and treatment of coi1-16 seedlings with ACC reduced cell length and root length to 90.7% and 76.5%, respectively (Table 4). Therefore, reduction in cell length could account for most if not all of the observed reduction in root length in the wild-type and 40% of the observed reduction in root length in coi1-16.. .

Standard error (SE) is shown for the value of cell length and cell elongation.. . . . . . ACC-induced, COI1-mediated root growth inhibition does not require SCF complex assembly but requires the LRR domain of COI1. The previous section described the possibility of different mechanisms by which MeJA- and ACC-induced COI1-mediated root growth inhibition might be regulated. To investigate this point further, the coi1-16 mutant was examined after various COI1 constructs had been introduced. The plants carrying the F-box or LRR region of COI1 and the COI1 gene with a substitution at Trp44 to alanine (W44), all fused to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in the Col background (Devoto et al., 2002), were crossed to coi1-16. The F3 lines that were confirmed to be homozygous for coi1-16 with each transgene expressed were used for the analyses. The parental transgenic lines F-box, LRR and W44 showed a wild-type response to MeJA and ACC in the light and in the dark (Fig. 5). The transgenic lines in the coi1-16 background (coi1-16;F-box, coi1-16;LRR, and coi1-16;W44) showed a statistical difference compared with the wild-type in response to MeJA, indicating that none of these transgenes is sufficient to complement completely the reduced response of coi1-16 to MeJA. In contrast, in response to ACC in the light, coi1-16;F-box showed a coi1-16-like response, and coi1-16;LRR and coi1-16;W44 showed a wild-type response, indicating that transgenes encoding the intact LRR domain are sufficient to complement the reduced response of coi1-16 to ACC in the light. Interestingly, the W44 transgene partially restored infertility of the coi1-1 null mutant, but not the F-box or LRR transgenes.. . Fig. 5.. . Complementation of coi1-16 with various COI1 constructs.

PMC3641185	Results. . Clonal Analysis of Petal Development. A convenient starting point for our analysis is when petal primordia have as simple shape and are about 30 m wide. We refer to this stage as 0 DAP (0 d after primordium formation) (Figure 1A). Petals took about 12 d to grow from 0 DAP to maturity, by which time they had an elongated shape that was wider towards the distal end (Figure 1B). At the end of the growth period, petals detach from the flower (abscission). Based on logarithmic plots of maximum petal width (at the petal's widest point, which is at the distal part of the petal) against time, we estimated that the growth rate in width was about 1.8% h-1 during 0-4 DAP and then about 1% h-1 for the remaining duration of petal development (Figure 1C). Plots of petal width against length showed that the growth rate in width is about 80% of the growth rate in length (Figure 1D). The maximum areal growth rate at earlier stages (0-4 DAP) is 4.1% h-1 (1.8% h-1 in width and 2.3% h-1 in length) and at later stages (4-12 DAP) is 2.3% h-1 (1% h-1 in width and 1.3% h-1 in length). The growth rates could also be captured with a smooth curve (Figure 1C, red dotted line). Based on the above growth analysis, we divided petal development into a series of 2-d intervals and estimated the average width of the petals at these times, which were used as a subsequent framework in our study (gray dashed lines, Figure 1C).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g001. Figure 1. . Petal growth analysis.. (A) Section of a petal primordium around day 0 DAP (days after primordium formation) (width, 35 m). (B) Petals at 10 DAP and 12 DAP (some sepals overlying the petals have been removed). (C) Standard flower 1 petal width (natural logarithm scale) against time (black asterisks) and fitted logistic curve (red dotted line) from initiation until maturity; time in days after primordium formation (DAP). The gradient of the curve is the growth rate in width. Dashed lines indicate average petal width at 2-d interval as estimated with the fitted curve: 30 m (0 DAP), 90 m (2 DAP), 180 m (4 DAP), 315 m (6 DAP), 520 m (8 DAP), 820 m (10 DAP), and 1,265 m (12 DAP). These time points can be related to previously defined flower stages [24] as follows: stages 5-6 (before 0 DAP), stages 7-9 (between 0-2 DAP), stage 10 (between 4-6 DAP), stages 11-12 (between 6-8 DAP), and stage 13 (10 DAP). (D) Petal length plotted against width during petal development (natural logarithm scales). The gradient of the fitted line is 0.78, showing that growth rate in width is less than in length. For comparison, the dotted green line has a gradient of 1. Scale bar, 20 m (A), 1 mm (B).. . . . To analyse growth patterns from 0 DAP onwards, we induced sectors in petal primordia at 0 DAP and visualised them at the end of each 2-d interval (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 DAP). This was achieved using a heat-shock-inducible Cre-Lox system. We induced sectors in a line carrying hsp18.2::Cre and 35S::lox-uidA-lox-GFP. [36]. A 1.5-min heat shock was given about 24 d after sowing, when the oldest flower was about to open. We then left the plants to grow for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 d and imaged sectors in petals with widths that correspond to 2-12 DAP, respectively. At each imaging stage, epidermal and subepidermal sectors from several petals were collated and mapped onto an average petal shape to produce a combined sector map (Figure 2). This allows clones initiated at 0 DAP to be visualised at successively later stages.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g002. Figure 2. . Petal clonal analysis after induction at 0 DAP.. (A) Sector map with shapes and positions of clones induced at 0 DAP and imaged 2 d after induction (at a width that corresponds to 2 DAP).

(J) Distal epidermal cells at 12 DAP at the position of the blue box in (I). (K) Proximal epidermal cells at the position of the violet box in (I). Images at (A, C-E, H, I) are scaled to the same length to allow the difference in clone shape to be compared. Scale bar, 5 m (B, G), 10 m (A, J), 20 m (F, K), 50 m (C), 100 m (D, E), 200 m (H), and 300 m (I).. . . . The results show that clones have an anisotropic shape from the earliest stages visualised and become increasingly anisotropic at later stages (Figure 2). For example, for petals at 2, 4, 8, and 12 DAP, clones in the distal half have a length-to-width ratio (L/W) of about 2, 4, 7, and 7, respectively. For the proximal region, the L/W values are about 3, 5, 7, and 11. The increasing L/W ratio of clones with stage of visualisation is consistent with anisotropic growth being maintained for an extended period. For example, if a clone grows at 2.5% h-1 along its length and at 1% h-1 along its width, then over 2 d the L/W ratio of a clone would increase by a factor of 2, while over 4 d it would increase by 4. Thus we estimate that growth rate is about twice as high along the main axis of the clones compared to the minor axis for early stages of development. The degree of anisotropy may decline in the distal half of the petal after 8 DAP as the L/W of the clones does not change very much after this time.. Anisotropic growth of clones is associated with different cell division rates along the major axis of the clone. For example, at 2 DAP epidermal clones in the distal half were about 4-6 cells long and 2-3 cells wide, indicating 2 rounds of cell division along the major axis of the clone, and 1 round along the minor axis (Figure 2B). At 8 DAP epidermal distal clones were about 30-60 cells long and 4-10 cells wide, indicating that from 0 DAP there had been 5-6 rounds of cell division along the major axis and 2-3 rounds of division along the minor axis (Figure 2F).. Changes in cell shape also made a contribution to anisotropic growth in some regions, particularly at later stages of development when cell division rate decreased. Based on the cell numbers in the epidermal clones, cell division rates were highest from 0-4 DAP and then decreased, particularly from 8 DAP onwards for the distal region (Table S1), in good agreement with cell division rates previously described in the petal [27],[31]. Nevertheless, areal growth rate of the petal was maintained at 2.3% h-1 (Figure 1C), indicating that cells continued to enlarge at a similar rate even though cell divisions were less frequent. This is reflected in an increase in cell area: the average cell area of epidermal cells in the distal part of the petal at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 DAP was 20 m2, 30 m2, 35 m2, 40 m2, 120 m2, and 325 m2, respectively (Figure 2B,F,G,J), which is in good agreement with cell size development described in the petal [27],[37]. The large increase in area at 10 DAP is consistent with cell divisions slowing down around this time. The L/W ratio for cells at later stages (12 DAP) was 1.2 for distal cells. This shows that anisotropy of growth occurred primarily in association with cell division for distal regions. For proximal regions the L/W ratio for epidermal cells at 12 DAP was 6-7 (Figure 2K), showing that anisotropic growth in proximal regions continued after cell divisions slowed down, leading to highly elongated cells [25],[28].. In addition to the degree of anisotropy, the orientation of the major axes of the clones provides information on growth patterns. In proximal regions, the major axis of the clones was oriented parallel to the midline, while in the distal half the orientations tended to fan out. The fanning out was evident from the earliest stage of clone visualisation (Figure 2A), indicating that growth was oriented in this fashion from early on.. The above analysis gives the cumulative growth of clones induced at 0 DAP, but to estimate growth of clones initiated later, we performed equivalent experiments by inducing clones at 2 DAP (Figure 3). This was achieved by heat shocking plants as before but visualising clones at stages that correspond to 2 d after those in the previous experiment. Thus for a plant that grew for 2 d after heat shock, clones were visualised at the 4 DAP stage. These clones thus derive from primordia that were at the 2 DAP stage during heat shock rather than 0 DAP under the previous experiment. Similarly, clones from plants that grew for 4, 6, 8, and 10 d after heat shock were visualised at 6, 8, 10, and 12 DAP, respectively.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g003. Figure 3. .

The black arrow points to distal clones at 12 DAP. Scale bar, 50 m (4 DAP), 100 m (6, 8 DAP), 200 m (10 DAP), and 300 m (12 DAP).. . . . Again, clones were highly anisotropic and fanned out particularly in distal regions (Figure 3). Some fanning out towards the lateral edges was also evident for lateral proximal clones (Figure 3, 6 and 8 DAP), and may relate to a bulge in petal width at the base of the petals during these stages.. Based on the above clonal analysis, we conclude the following: (1) Growth is distributed over the whole petal as clones do not vary greatly in size from one region to another. (2) Growth rates are higher at earlier stages of petal development, during which growth is largely attended by cell division. At later stages, cell division rates fall, although growth continues through cell enlargement. (3) Growth is anisotropic for an extended period, with clones having a major axis of elongation from the earliest stages, and becoming more anisotropic as they grow for longer periods. (4) The major axis of the clones tends to be oriented proximodistally but fans out particularly in more distal regions.. . . Petal Development Can Be Accounted for by a Divergent Polarity Field. We used the results from clonal analysis to evaluate hypotheses for petal growth. The aim of this study was not to provide a detailed model that would account for all aspects of petal growth, but to compare broad classes of models to determine whether they could account for the overall transformations in petal shape and clonal patterns. These models were formulated using the Growing Polarised Tissue framework (GPT framework), in which growth rates can be specified by a distribution of factors over a tissue [15],[38],[39]. Regions of the tissue are mechanically connected, forming a canvas, allowing the deformation resulting from specified local growth patterns to be computed. Each model has three components: an initial canvas shape with distributed factors, a system for specifying polarity, and a growth regulatory network.. The starting shape for the canvas is based on a simplified petal primordium shape at 0 DAP (Figures 1A and 4A). Given the observed anisotropy of clones, we used models that incorporate tissue polarity, which allows orientations of preferential growth to be specified locally. According to this framework, growth orientations are specified by the gradient of a factor, POLARISER (POL), which can propagate through the canvas. POL is generated at regions referred to as +organisers and may also be degraded at a high rate in regions referred to as -organisers. The gradient of POL provides a local polarity that enables two types of growth rate to be specified through the growth regulatory network: growth rate parallel to the polarity axis (Kpar) and growth rate perpendicular to the polarity axis (Kper). The pattern of specified growth rates leads to deformation of the canvas. The resultant growth pattern and shape may contain features, such as curvature, that were not directly specified as they arise through the constraints of tissue connectedness [39],[40].. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g004. Figure 4. . Model for petal development with a convergent or a divergent polarity field.. (A) Canvas at 0 DAP for convergent model.

Kpar has a fixed value, whereas Kper is promoted by DGRAD. (D) Canvas at 0 DAP for divergent model. Compared to (A) POL is now degraded at a high rate at the DISTORG (in cyan) region. The result is a field of polarities that diverges toward the distal margin. (E) Distribution of DGRAD (terracotta) for divergent model (bracket indicates plateau of maximum DGRAD).

(I) Output of divergent model for 0-12 DAP, showing patterns of virtual clones induced at 0 DAP. (J) Same as (I) but virtual clones induced at 2 DAP. Black arrows point to distal clones at 12 DAP in (F, G, I, J). Scale bar, 10 m (A, B, D, E, F) (0-2 DAP), (G) (2 DAP), (I) (0-2 DAP), (J) (2 DAP); 100 m (F, G, I, J) (6-10 DAP); 1 mm (F-J) (12 DAP).. . . . We first developed a model for petal development that incorporates a tissue polarity pattern similar to that employed in a previously published model for leaf development (Figure 4A) [15]. In this model, POL production is promoted at the base of the canvas through an identity factor PROXORG (+organiser) and is degraded everywhere at a constant rate. Propagation of POL through the canvas generates a proximodistal field of polarities that is parallel to the midline in the basal half of the initial canvas and converges towards the tip (the position most distant from the +organiser) (Figure 4A, black arrows). We refer to this model as the convergent model.. The observed anisotropy of petal clones suggests that Kpar should be higher than Kper. This was implemented in our model by assuming a basic value for Kpar of 1.7% h-1 and Kper of 0.65% h-1 throughout the petal. To account for the broadening shape of the petal towards the distal region, we also invoked a factor DGRAD, which has a value of 0 at the base of the canvas and increases linearly to a plateau value of 1 shortly before the distal tip (Figure 4B). DGRAD promotes Kper, as shown in the growth regulatory network (Figure 4C), and the distribution of DGRAD deforms together with the tissue during growth (i.e., it is fixed to tissue).. The output of this model was a canvas with a final length, width, and outline shape similar to that of a mature petal (Figure 4F, 12 DAP). To determine whether the growth pattern also matched experimental data, we created virtual clones by marking circular regions on the initial canvas (equivalent to 0 DAP) and monitoring their shapes as they deform with the canvas (Figure 4F). Similar to experimental clones, virtual clones were anisotropic in proximal regions of the petal and showed a tendency to fan out more distally. However, the virtual clones were almost isotropic in shape towards the distal end of the petal at later stages (arrow in Figure 4F, 12 DAP) in contrast to experimental clones that are highly anisotropic (arrow in Figure 2I). The same problem (i.e., round distal clones at late stages) was observed for virtual clones induced at 2 DAP (compare arrowed clones in Figure 4G, 12 DAP with Figure 3, 12 DAP). The round distal clone shape is generated because of the requirement of high rates of Kper in the distal domain, which ensure that the petal becomes wider distally. If we reduce the extent by which DGRAD promotes Kper, clones are more anisotropic distally but the petal shape is now too narrow (Figure 4H).. To resolve this discrepancy in clone shapes between model outputs and experimental data, we explored an alternative hypothesis in which polarity does not converge at the tip but fans out towards the distal margin. This was implemented by using a broad distal organiser (DISTORG, -organiser) that degrades POL at a high rate (Figure 4D). We refer to this as the divergent model. To maintain a higher level of anisotropy in distal clones, compared to the previous model, we reduced the extent to which DGRAD promotes Kper and increased the basic value of Kpar to 1.8% h-1. In addition, we expanded the distal region where DGRAD forms a plateau as this gives a better final petal shape (Figure 4E).. As with the convergent model, the final overall canvas shape and size generated by the divergent model showed a reasonable match to that of the wild-type petal (Figure 4I). In addition, the shape of virtual clones in the divergent model gave a much better match to observed clones. Distal clones were now elongated, similar to the experimental data (compare Figure 4I, 12 DAP with Figure 2I, 12 DAP). Moreover, virtual clones induced at 2 DAP fanned out more, similar to what is observed experimentally (compare arrowed clones in Figure 4J, 12 DAP with Figure 3, 12 DAP). Thus, the divergent model, in which there is a broad distal organiser as well as a proximal organiser, gives a better fit to all of the data than the convergent model.. . . Testing Predictions of a Divergent Polarity Field and a Broad Distal Organiser. As a further test of these models, we analysed the distribution of factors that might mark the proposed distal organiser. Perhaps the best candidate for a molecule involved in polarity propagation in plants is auxin. In leaf primordia, auxin is thought to flow proximodistally in the epidermis and accumulate at the distal tip, consistent with the convergent model. From there it flows back towards proximal regions through subepidermal and provascular tissue, defining the position of the future midvein ([19], Figure 5B, central broken blue line). The epidermal polarity pattern is supported by a major site of auxin accumulation at the leaf tip, as indicated by expression of the auxin response marker DR5::GFP (Figure 5A-C).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g005. Figure 5. . Broad distal distribution of auxin response marker DR5::GFP in the petal distal margin.. (A-C) In leaf primordia, DR5 is expressed at the tip through early to later stages of development. DR5 is also expressed in the internal provasculature system (marked with a broken blue line in B). (D, E) In petal primordia at 0 and 0.5 DAP, DR5 is expressed at the distal tip. The orange line indicates the extent of the DR5 signal along the petal margin. (F, G) At 2-3 DAP, DR5 activity expands to a broader distal domain of the petal margin. (H) At 5 DAP the broad pattern of petal marginal expression is maintained. (I) At 7 DAP petal marginal expression narrows (the broken orange line marks the region where the DR5 domain first disappears). (J) By 10 DAP petal marginal expression has disappeared. DR5 signal in the internal provasculature system of the petal in (E-H). Width of leaves (A-C): 46, 80, and 150 m. Width of petals (D-J): 26, 45, 82, 141, 261, 374, and 875 m. Scale bar, 20 m (A-G), 40 m (H), 80 m (I), and 250 m (J).. . . . We therefore imaged the DR5::GFP marker [41],[42] in developing petals to determine whether they have a site of epidermal auxin accumulation at the distal tip or whether they have a broader domain of accumulation, as might be expected from the divergent model. At early stages of petal development (0-0.5 DAP), signal was seen at the distal tip of the petal primordia (orange line, Figure 5D,E), similar to the pattern observed in leaf primordia at a similar size (Figure 5A). However, at slightly later stages (1-3 DAP) signal was seen over a broader distal domain of the petal marginal epidermis (orange line, Figure 5F,G), although the signal was not uniform but varied in intensity along the margin. By contrast, leaf primordia at a similar size continued to show signal in a more restricted region at the distal tip (Figure 5B,C). The extended distal expression of DR5 in petals is consistent with epidermal polarity diverging towards a broad distal -organiser. DR5 signal was also seen in the internal provascular system of the petal primordia, and may reflect auxin transport from the epidermal distal organiser towards the petal interior (Figure 5E-H). The broad pattern of distal epidermal expression was maintained in petal primordia during later stages (3-6 DAP, Figure 5H), although it eventually narrowed (6-10 DAP, Figure 5I) and then disappeared (10 DAP, Figure 5J). Thus, the DR5 analysis is consistent with auxin in the petal epidermis being transported to a broad distal region for much of development as expected from the divergent model in which petals have a broad distal organiser.. A further marker for cell polarity is the auxin efflux carrier protein PIN1, which localises to the distal end of epidermal cells in early leaf primordia [19],[20]. We therefore monitored the pattern of PIN1 expression in developing petal primordia using a PIN1::PIN1:GFP fusion [41]. At 0 DAP epidermal PIN1 was preferentially localised to the distal end of cells in the plane of the organ (Figure 6A). This distal location was particularly evident in cases where PIN1 spanned cell junctions. To clarify the polarity pattern, we drew arrows on cells pointing toward the centre of the distal PIN1 signal when it clearly spanned a cell junction (white arrows Figure 6A). At 0.5 DAP the orientation of polarity suggests that it points divergently rather than convergently towards the distal end of the tissue (Figure 6B). Strong expression is also seen at or near the petal margin but without clear polar localisation. At 1.5 DAP the divergent pattern of polarity in the main plane of the epidermis was still evident (Figure 6C). Strong expression was also seen in the provascular and margin tissue at this stage (Figure 6D). At 3.5 DAP, epidermal signal was lower in the main plane of the petal but could still be seen with high laser exposure and had a divergent pattern (Figure 6E,F). Strong signal was again observed in the petal margin at this stage but without clear polar localisation. Between 4 and 7 DAP, PIN1 signal could no longer be detected in the main plane of the petal but could still be observed in the petal margin and vascular tissue (Figure 6G-I). Little signal was observed from 7 DAP onwards (Figure 6J). Thus, the results from this analysis indicate that epidermal cells in the main plane of the petal have divergent polarity pattern from 0.5-3.5 DAP, after which the PIN1 marker could not be detected in these cells. This is again consistent with the divergent model, and indicates that maintenance of polarity after 3.5 DAP may involve proteins other than PIN1.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g006. Figure 6. .

(A) At 0 DAP, epidermal PIN1::GFP is preferentially localised to the distal end of cells in the plane of the petal. White arrows on cells point towards the centre of the distal PIN1 expression. (B, C) At 0.5 and 1.5 DAP, PIN1 polarity in the epidermis points divergently toward the distal end of the tissue.

(G) At 4 DAP, PIN1 signal is no longer detected in the main plane of the petal but can be observed in the petal margin and vascular tissue. (H) Close up of (G). (I) At 6.5 DAP, expression at the distal margin has disappeared. (J) Little signal is observed from 7 DAP onwards. Width of petals: (A-C) 30, 45, and 75; (E) 146; (G) 170; (I) 343; (J) 425 m. Scale bar, 20 m (A-H), 50 m (I), and 80 m (J).. . . . In addition to PIN1, we found that PIN3 was also expressed in petal primordia from 0.5 DAP (Figure 7A,B). At this stage PIN3:PIN3::GFP reporter [43] gave a strong signal at the distal tip of the petal (magenta line, Figure 7B), similar to the DR5 reporter. At slightly later stages (1-3 DAP), PIN3 signal was in a broader distal domain (magenta line, Figure 7C,D), similar to the expression of DR5. At 4-6 DAP the PIN3 domain extended all around the petal margin (Figure 7E-G). It also started being expressed in the distal epidermis, especially in the regions adjacent to the margin with preferential localisation at the top and the bottom cell walls (Figure 7E-G). Expression was also detected in the veins (Figure 7E-H). From 8 DAP onwards PIN3 signal became stronger throughout the epidermis of the petal and was not polarly localised in the distal half of the petal (Figure 7I). In the proximal half of the petal, PIN3 signal was polarly localised in the epidermis with polarity pointing away from the margin (Figure 7J, white arrows). At later stages of petal development (11 DAP) the signal was strong throughout the epidermis (Figure 7K). Thus, PIN3 expression seems to correlate with the position of the putative -organiser as well as revealing a divergent polarity pattern at later stages.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g007. Figure 7. . Auxin efflux carrier PIN3 expression correlates with the distal organiser position.. (A) At 0 DAP, PIN3::PIN3:GFP signal is not detected at early stages of petal development. (B) By 0.5 DAP, PIN3 expression is detected at the distal tip of the petal. The magenta line indicates the extent of the PIN3 signal. (C, D) At 1.5 and 2 DAP, expression extends all around the distal marginal domain in a continuous way. (E) At 4 DAP, expression is also seen at the proximal marginal domain and in the veins.

(K-L) At 11 DAP, PIN3 signal is strong throughout the epidermis (in both distal regions, K, and proximal regions, L). Width of petals: (A-F) 30, 47, 68, 98, 196, and 330; (H) 658; and (K) 1,020 m. Scale bar, 20 m (A-E, G, I, K, L), 120 m (F), and 200 m (H).. . . . . . JAG Is a Candidate for a Distal Regulator of Growth. In addition to invoking particular organiser patterns, the models described above invoke a factor DGRAD, which has high levels in distal regions of the petal and promotes Kper. The role of DGRAD in petal shape can be illustrated by creating virtual mutants in which the level of DGRAD is reduced to 50% or eliminated (Figure 8A). For both the convergent and divergent models, this gives petals that are much narrower (only the results for the divergent model are shown in Figure 8A). Petals are also slightly shorter, which arises because polarity is oriented diagonally in much of the distal region, with the consequence that the component of Kpar contributing to length is reduced whilst the contribution from Kper is increased, decreasing petal length. Candidate genes that may contribute to DGRAD activity would thus be expected to give mutants with narrow, short petals and should be expressed at a higher level in distal regions of wild-type petals.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g008. Figure 8. . . JAGGED is a good candidate for a distal-specific factor that contributes to DGRAD and promotes Kper.. (A) Canvas for divergent petal models with different DGRAD (terracotta region) activity in promoting Kper. 100% activity corresponds to the wild-type model (as in Figure 4C-E), and 50% and 0% activity correspond to virtual mutant models in which the level of DGRAD is reduced to 50% or eliminated. Canvas is shown at 0 DAP (time of virtual clone induction), 2 DAP, and 12 DAP. (B) Flowers of jag-2 and jag-1 mutants. (C-D) Representative outlines of jag-1 petals at various stages of development. Width of petals shown: 87, 310, and 530 m. (E) Petal length against width throughout petal development (in natural logarithm scale) for wild type (gray crosses) and jag-1 (black crosses). The blue and red lines are the linear regressions for the wild type and mutant, respectively. The gradient for jag-1 is 0.65 compared to 0.78 for wild-type petals, showing that jag petals grow less in width compared to length (see also Figure 1D). (F-G) JAG expression pattern at various stages of petal development as visualised with the jag-3 mutant line complemented with a JAG::JAG:VENUS construct. The widths for each DAP images are: 1.5 DAP (75 m), 5.5 DAP (271 m), 6.5 (363 m), and 8.5 DAP (575 m). For the image at 1.5 DAP the YFP channel is shown merged with the red channel (corresponding to the emission of chlorophyll autofluorescence) Scale bar, 10 m (A) (0-2 DAP) (C), 20 m (F), 100 m (D, G), 500 m (B), 1 mm (A) (12 DAP).. . . . One such gene is JAGGED (JAG), which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor and gives short narrow petals in putative null mutants (Figure 8B-D; [26],[32]). Compared to wild type, in which growth rate in width is 80% of that in length, for jag-1 mutant the growth rate in width is 70% that in length, consistent with reduced Kper (Figure 8E). Further support for a role of JAG in DGRAD activity is that it is expressed in the distal domain of the petal, as revealed by in situ hybridizations to longitudinal sections of flower buds [26]. To get a clearer picture of JAG expression in the plane of the petal, we used a jag mutant line complemented with a JAG::JAG:VENUS construct [32]. This showed that JAG is localised in the distal half of the petal from early stages (e.g., 1.5 DAP, Figure 8F). This expression pattern is maintained for several more days (5.5 DAP, Figure 8G), although signal declines in the most distal regions. The decline in signal spreads proximally (6.5 DAP, Figure 8G), and eventually signal becomes very weak throughout the petal (8.5 DAP, Figure 8G). Thus, based on both its mutant phenotype and expression pattern, JAG is a good candidate for a distal-specific factor that contributes to DGRAD and promotes Kper.. As JAG is expressed in distal petal regions, it also provides a candidate for a direct or indirect modulator of the broad distal organiser in the divergent model. For example, the distribution of the distal organiser could be promoted by JAG expression near the petal margin. An effect of JAG on the distal -organiser may also help to explain another feature of jag mutant petals: they have serrated or jagged distal margins (Figure 8D). This phenotype might be accounted for if jag mutants have a reduced and more discontinuous distal organiser activity. This would lead to a jagged or serrated distal outline phenotype, with the tip of the serrations corresponding to regions with high organiser activity (Figure 9A,B).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g009. Figure 9. . A less active and more discontinuous distal organiser in jagged mutants.. (A) Initial canvas for divergent petal model (as in Figure 4D) with no DGRAD activity (as in Figure 8A, 0% model) and with a more discontinuous distal organiser activity as implemented by a discontinuous DISTORG (cyan) region. (B) Canvas at 2 and 12 DAP. Petals develop a jagged or serrated distal petal outline, with the tip of the serrations corresponding to regions with high DISTORG activity (as shown in the enlargement of the orange square at 12 DAP). (C) DR5::GFP signal is not detected at early stages in jag-1 mutant, and (D, E) it is detected at later stages in several regions of the distal domain in a discontinuous way. (F) Enlargement of the orange square in (E). (G) PIN1::PIN1:GFP in jag-1 mutant. PIN1 signal is reduced in the jag-1 mutant at all stages and has a narrower distribution in the distal margin compared to wild-type petal (compare with Figure 6D). (H) PIN3::PIN3:GFP in jag-1 mutant shows reduced expression, and it is more discontinuous in the distal margin (compare with wild type in Figure 7D). Width of petals: (C-G) 123, 310, 515, 66, and 84 m. Scale bar, 10 m (A, B) (2 DAP), 20 m (C, G, H), 100 m (D), 200 m (E).. . . . To test this possibility, we determined the pattern of DR5::GFP, PIN1::PIN1:GFP, and PIN3::PIN3:GFP expression in the jag mutant. Signal from the DR5 construct could not be detected at early stages in jag mutant petal primordia (Figure 9C). At later stages, when the jag petal primordia were more than half their mature width, DR5 signal started to be detected and was observed in several regions of the distal domain (Figure 9D-F). Thus, if DR5 signal is a marker for -organiser position, the organiser is reduced and more discontinuous in the jag mutant. Expression of PIN1 was reduced in the jag mutant at all stages and had a narrower distribution in the distal margin (compare Figure 9G with Figure 6D). The PIN1 expressing marginal region corresponds to where distal serrations form in the jag mutant. Expression of PIN3 was also reduced in the jag mutant (compare Figure 9H with Figure 7D). As with DR5, PIN3 signal was more discontinuous in the distal margin, although this pattern was observable at an earlier stage (compare Figure 9H with Figure 9C). Thus, PIN3 signal may also be a marker for -organiser activity, and its distribution confirms that the -organiser is less active and more discontinuous in the jag mutant.. . . Test of Model through JAG Ectopic Expression. As a further way of testing whether JAG contributes to DGRAD and the distal organiser, we analysed lines ectopically expressing JAG under the control of the flower-specific promoter AP1 (line AP1>>JAG), which is active in the whole petal primordium until later stages of petal development (Figure S1). In addition to the previously described strong phenotypes in which sepal organs are fused and petal organs are reduced or deformed (Figure 10A) [26],[32], we obtained multiple lines with weaker JAG expression in which sepals were not fused and petals were wider (Figure 10B,E-G). The severity of the phenotypes correlated positively with the level of JAG expression (Figure S2). In plants with intermediate phenotypes, petals had a phenotype opposite to that of the jag mutant: the distal region of the petals, characterised by conical epidermal cells, was enlarged in comparison to the wild type (Figure 10B-D).. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g010. Figure 10. . Effect of extending the DGRAD and distal organiser domains.. (A) Ectopic JAG line (AP1>>JAG) flower with a strong phenotype in which sepal organs are fused and petal organs are reduced or deformed (same flower is shown with or without sepals). (B) Ectopic JAG line flower with an intermediate phenotype in which petals have a different shape, as if the region of the petal with distal identity has extended more proximally. (C) Wild-type flower with paddle shape petals. (D) jag-1 mutant flower with petals with a reduced distal region. (E-G) Representative petal outlines from intermediate phenotype lines at various stages of development. Width of petals: 115 m (E), 294 m (F), 940 m (G). (H) Initial canvas for divergent petal model with a proximally extended DGRAD region (terracotta, bracket indicates plateau of maximum DGRAD), and an extended DISTORG (cyan) region. The polarity field diverges at more proximal positions than in the wild-type model (compare with Figure 4D,E). (I) Model output at 2, 6, and 12 DAP showing patterns of virtual clones induced at 0 DAP and broadening of more proximal regions compared to the model for wild type (Figure 4J). (J, K) DR5::GFP expression in the intermediate phenotype ectopic JAG line extends more proximally compared with wild type (Figure 5G-I). The orange line indicates the extent of the DR5 signal. Width of petals: 139 m (J), 294 m (K). Scale bar, 10 m (E, H, I) (2 DAP), 20 m (J), 50 m (K), 100 m (F, I) (6 DAP), 200 m (G), 500 m (A-D), 1 mm (I) (12 DAP).. . . . This intermediate phenotype could be readily accounted for by our model if we assume that JAG expression is extended more proximally in these lines (Figure 10H). This would lead to enhancement of DGRAD in proximal regions and a broader distal organiser (through the promoting effect of JAG on the distal organiser) (Figure 10H). The result is a petal in which the distal domain extends more proximally, resembling the ectopic JAG lines (Figure 10I). To determine whether the distal organiser has a broader distribution in the ectopic JAG line, we crossed the line to the DR5 marker line. As predicted, the distal marginal domain of DR5 expression extended more proximally in the ectopic JAG line (Figure 10J,K, orange lines, compare with Figure 5G-I).. . . . JAG Directly Regulates PTL. . A possible mechanism by which JAG enhances distal organiser activity is through regulation of PTL, which functions upstream of auxin-mediated signalling in the control of petal development [30]. PTL is expressed in the margin of the developing petal but excluded from the distal margin [44], where we propose the broad distal organiser acts. This exclusion may arise through JAG repressing PTL in this region, thus promoting -organiser activity.. To test whether JAG represses PTL, we first checked the levels of PTL mRNA by qRT-PCR in wild-type and jag-1 inflorescences and confirmed that they were increased in the mutant compared with wild type (Figure 11A). We then determined whether PTL was directly down-regulated by JAG using a dexamethasone-inducible 35S::JAG:GR system [35]. The results showed that activation of JAG:GR lowered PTL mRNA levels, and that this repression did not require new protein synthesis (Figure 11B). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using 35S::JAG:GR inflorescences confirmed direct, dexamethasone-dependent binding of JAG-GR to the PTL promoter region (Figure 11C). We conclude that JAG acts as a direct transcriptional repressor of PTL.. . 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550.g011. Figure 11. . . JAGGED directly represses PETAL LOSS.. .

Inoculation of WT Arabidopsis leaves with a conidial suspension of B. cinerea resulted in disease symptoms 24 to 48 h post-inoculation, which appeared as necrotic spots under the inoculation droplets; 72 to 96 h post-inoculation, the size of the spots got larger, becoming water-soaked lesions (Figure 1A). Inoculation of shn1-1D leaves with B. cinerea lead to similar disease symptoms (Figure 1A), yet the lesions developed on shn1-1D leaves were 35 to 45% larger than those developed on infected WT leaves (Figure 1B). Furthermore, lesions on infected shn1-1D leaves exhibited larger chlorotic areas than those on infected WT leaves (Figure 1C). PCR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses of inoculated leaves revealed elevated levels of fungal DNA (Figure 1D) and denser fungal mycelium, respectively, in the lesion area (Figure 1E) of shn1-1D leaves, as compared to WT leaves. We further analyzed the spread of B. cinereas hyphae and plant cell viability in the chlorotic areas of infected leaves by vital stain using trypan blue. We did not observe any hyphae outside the expanding lesion, but a larger number of dead cells were identified around the lesions in inoculated shn1-1D leaves than in WT leaves (Figure 2A). The increased number of dead cells in shn1-1D leaves was further confirmed by ion-leakage analysis of cells located around the lesion; this revealed significantly higher ion leakage in shn1-1D vs. WT cells (Figure 2B). In addition, we observed that shn1-1D plants senesce and die faster than WT plants following inoculation with B. cinerea, as determined by counting the number of dead leaves 9 up to 96 h post-inoculation (Figure 2C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0070146.g001.

Asterisk denotes statistical difference between WT and shn1-1D plants calculated for the specified time point by Students t-test (P<0.05). Shown is one representative experiment out of at least three more experiments with similar results.. . . . We next tested the susceptibility of shn1-1D to other necrotrophic fungi. We analyzed the lesion size on infected leaves 48 and 144 h post-inoculation with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Figure 1F) and Alternaria brassicicola (Figure 1G), respectively. Our data showed that shn1-1D plants are generally more susceptible to necrotrophic pathogens than WT plants. Worth noting is that inoculation with A. brassicicola, which is a crucifer specialist that is usually not very aggressive on ecotype Ws-0 (the corresponding background of shn1-1D), resulted in quicker cell discoloration and death in shn1-1D vs. Ws-0 WT plants, similar to the susceptible ecotype Ler (Figure 1G).. . . shn1-1D Plants Produce More H2O2 in Response to B. cinerea Infection and Abiotic Stress. ROS production, which can be triggered by many signals, including cutin, is one of the plants defense responses against biotic and abiotic stresses [13], [14]. We tested ROS accumulation by measuring H2O2 accumulation using DAB staining of shn1-1D and WT plants in response to B. cinerea infection. Figure 3A shows thatshn1-1D plants exhibited significantly higher levels of H2O2 following B. cinerea infection than the WT plants. shn1-1D plants also accumulated significantly more H2O2 following various abiotic stresses, which included mechanical wounding (Figure 3B) and paraquat treatment, irrespective of the treatment method (foliage immersion, filtration, spraying or drop application) (Figure 3B and Figure S1A). Note that with the paraquat treatment, higher H2O2 production in shn1-1D plants was correlated with their higher death rate: when 25 M paraquat solution was sprayed on the foliage, 36.1% of the shn1-1D plants died 1 week after spraying, in contrast to only 0.48% of the WT plants. These results indicate that shn1-1D mutants produce more active H2O2 against various adverse environmental stresses, including B. cinerea infection. This might have elicited the observed massive cell death which, in turn, might have contributed to shn1-1D sensitivity to the necrotrophic fungus B. cinerea. Indeed, when diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADP(H) oxidase, was added to the B. cinerea inoculation suspension, we observed inhibition of infection on both shn1-1D and WT leaves (Figure S1B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0070146.g003. Figure 3. . ROS accumulation in shn1-1D.. A, ROS accumulation following biotic stress. H2O2 production was measured by staining shn1-1D and WT leaves with DAB 72 h post-inoculation with B. cinerea, and quantifying the DAB-stained area. Bars represent meansSD of 15 leaves. Different letters represent significant difference by Tukey-Kramer HSD test (P<0.0001). Shown is one representative experiment out of at least three more experiments with similar results. B, ROS accumulation following abiotic stress. H2O2 production was measured by staining shn1-1D and WT leaves with DAB after mechanical wounding; 100 M DPI was added to control leaves (upper panel), and 8 h after immersion in 10 M paraquat or water as a control (lower panel).. . . . . . Cell-death Induction in shn1-1D Plants does not Support P. syringae Proliferation. Whereas massive cell death supports the growth of necrotrophs, it is expected to restrict the proliferation of biotrophic pathogens [25]. We examined the proliferation of the biotroph P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in shn1-1D plants relative to WT plants. We spray-inoculated leaves with virulent P. syringae, and extracted and counted colony-forming units 2 h (0) and 3, 6 and 9 days post-inoculation. Interestingly, while both shn1-1D and WT plants were inoculated with the same concentration of bacterial suspension, shn1-1D plants carried more bacterial colony-forming units at the time of infection (2 h post-inoculation) and later on at 3 and 6 days post-inoculation, most likely due to their permeable cuticle. However, 9 days post-inoculation, the number of P. syringae colony-forming units in the shn1-1D plants was similar to that in the WT plants (Figure 4B). Nevertheless, shn1-1D plants exhibited a more chlorotic phenotype than the WT plants (Figure 4A). Similarly, no differences in the number of bacterial colony-forming units were observed between shn1-1D and WT leaves, which were spray-inoculated with Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Figure S2A), yet the shn1-1D plants were chlorotic as compared to the WT (Figure S2B). Collectively, our data suggest that accelerated cell death in shn1-1D may contribute to high sensitivity to necrotrophic pathogens such as B. cinerea, S. sclerotiorum and A. brassicicola (Figure 1).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0070146.g004.

For a comprehensive view of the transcriptomic changes in shn1-1D plants following infection with B. cinerea, their gene expression was analyzed using the Affymetrix ATH1 genome array and Partek statistical package. shn1-1D and WT leaves were harvested from mock-inoculated plants and from B. cinerea-inoculated plants for the microarray analysis. Our analysis revealed that 72 h post-inoculation with B. cinerea, the expression levels of 1,299 and 1,543 genes were changed at least twofold relative to noninoculated plants in B. cinerea-inoculated WT and shn1-1D, respectively. Among these genes, 839 (55%) were solely differentially expressed post-inoculation in shn1-1D and 595 (46%) of them were solely differentially expressed in the WT (Figure 5A). The overlapping set of genes, upregulated in both shn1-1D and the WT 72 h post-infection, included 704 genes, among them many of the pathogenesis-related genes that are typically activated upon B. cinerea infection (Table S1). We did not observe activation of pathogenesis-related genes in mock noninfected shn1-1D (Table S2).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0070146.g005. Figure 5. . Differential gene regulation by B. cinerea in shn1-1D and WT.. A, Venn diagram representing overlapping or non-overlapping gene sets differentially expressed in WT or shn1-1D plants 72 h after infection with B. cinerea and defined by FC >2 (P<0.05). B, Relative gene expression between inoculated and noninoculated shn1-1D and WT plants. Expression of selected genes from microarray data validated using qRT-PCR on cDNA extracted from shn1-1D or WT leaves 72 h after inoculation with B. cinerea relative to noninoculated leaves (mock).. . . . Further analysis of genes that were differentially expressed in inoculated plants (marked by a threefold cutoff) revealed induction of 220 genes and repression of 131 genes in shn1-1D but not WT plants, whereas 85 genes were induced and 102 genes repressed in WT but not shn1-1D plants, 72 h post-inoculation with B. cinerea (Tables S 3 and S4). Genes exhibiting greater than threefold differential expression post-inoculation (P<0.05) were assigned to functional categories using MapMan. The classification of genes expressed post-inoculation exclusively in shn1-1D or in WT plants is presented in Figure S3. The percentage of upregulated genes in the categories of cell-wall localization, energy and development did not differ between shn1-1D and the WT. However, in agreement with the higher ROS accumulation, many more oxidative stress, secondary metabolism, hormone regulation, cellular and fungal sensing, cell death, detoxification and stress response genes were upregulated post-inoculation with B. cinerea in shn1-1D vs. the WT (Figure S3). Stress-related genes that were differentially regulated post-inoculation in shn1-1D vs. WT plants are listed in Table 1.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0070146.t001. Table 1. .

Shown genes related to detoxification, secondary metabolism, and stress responses that were upregulated greater than twofold 72 h after Botrytis cinerea infection. Microarray data are derived from two biologically independent experiments; details are given in Supplemental Table 1and 2 online.. . . . We further validated the expression levels of genes related to defense [phytoalexin deficient 3 (PAD3), TGACG motif binding transcription factor 1 (TGA1), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1 (PAL1), Jasmonate Insensitive 1(JAI1) and elicitor peptide 3 precursor (PROPEP3)], detoxification [(Glutathione S-transferase 11(GST11)], senescence and oxidative stress [senescence-associated gene 12 (SAG12) and alternative oxidase 1D (AOX1D)], and programmed cell death (PCD) [(accelerated cell death 11 (ACD11)] by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 5B). Gene expression was also validated in five independent biological experiments (Figure S4). Further analysis of the microarray data using the Limma statistical suite revealed similar results (Table S5). This activation pattern of the oxidative stress response genes was actually supported by ROS accumulation (Figure 3), indicating that the strong gene activation in shn1-1D is not due to a putative expression loop that does not support translation.. Taken together, our data indicate that in response to B. cinerea infection, the shn1-1D transcriptome changes differently from that of the WT, with stronger activation of defense-, stress-, senescence- and PCD-related genes. Interestingly, these genes activation was ineffective against B. cinerea, A. brassicicola and S. sclerotiorum, since the outcome was sensitivity of shn1-1D plants to those necrotrophic pathogens.. . . shn1-1D Cutin Monomer Extract Affects Plant Sensitivity to B. cinerea. The characteristic SHN1/WIN1 overexpressor phenotype includes very high cutin content; the activation-tagged shn1-1D line used in this study was found to have a total of 28 times more cutin content than the WT (Figure S5). In comparison, overexpression of the SHN1 gene under the constitutive 35S promoter leads to just a 3.5-fold increase in cutin levels as compared to WT plants [23]. Furthermore, not only was the total amount of cutin altered (Figure S5A), but its composition was as well (Figure S5B), and the fold change of each monomer ranged from 7 to 104 times more cutins in shn1-1D (Figure S5C). To determine if cutin monomer content and composition in shn1-1D plants are responsible for their susceptibility to B. cinerea, cutin monomers were extracted from shn1-1D and WT plants. They were then applied together with the B. cinerea conidial suspension to WT leaves. Interestingly, B. cinerea pathogenicity was inhibited when the inoculation suspension applied to WT leaves was supplemented with 0.04 g/cm2 of shn1-1D cutin monomers as compare to WT plants inoculate with B. cinerea only (Figure 6A). We did not observe this activated-resistance effect when we added higher concentrations of cutin monomers (0.1, 0.4 or 0.8 g/cm2 of either WT- or shn1-1D-extracted cutin monomers) or a lower concentration (0.004 g/cm2) (Figure 6A), suggesting that the defense response is dependent on both cutin monomer dose and composition.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0070146.g006. Figure 6. . Effect of cutin monomers on disease symptoms and gene expression.. A, WT leaves were inoculated with B. cinerea spores supplemented with 0.04, 0.4 or 0.8 g/cm2 cutin monomers extracted from either shn1-1D (shn1-1D-CM) or the WT (WT-CM). As a control, we used WT and shn1-1D leaves inoculated with B. cinerea only. Presented are meansSD of chlorotic area of 15 leaves 72 h post-inoculation. Different letters represent significant difference by Tukey-Kramer HSD analysis (P<0.05). B, Expression of selected genes in WT leaves inoculated with B. cinerea spores supplemented with 0.04 g/cm2 cutin monomers extracted from either shn1-1D (WT+shn1-1D-CM) or WT (WT+WT-CM). As a control, we used WT and shn1-1D leaves inoculated with B. cinerea only. C, PAL1 expression in WT leaves supplemented with 0.04 g/cm2 cutin monomers extracted from either shn1-1D (WT+shn1-1D CM) or WT (WT+WT-CM).. . . . To check whether this effect is the result of direct toxicity of the extracted cutin monomers to the fungus, cutin monomer extracts were added to PDA plates to examine their effects on B. cinerea spore germination. Interestingly, B. cinerea spore germination on PDA plates containing cutin monomers from either shn1-1D or WT plants did not differ (Figure S6A). To test whether the observed susceptibility of shn1-1D to B. cinerea is due to higher carbon source availability in the thick shn1-1D cuticle we used a cutinase-deficient B. cinerea mutant [26] for pathogenicity assays. We found that shn1-1D is also more susceptible than the WT to this mutant (Figure S6B).. . . shn1-1D Cutin Monomer Composition can Control Defense Activation. We quantified the transcripts of PAD3, AOX1D and PROPEP3 (PEP3) (genes that were strongly upregulated in the microarray analysis, Table 1) by qRT-PCR after coinoculation with B. cinerea and cutin monomers. In accordance with the resistance found when shn1-1D cutin monomers were supplemented to the inoculation suspension (Figure 6A), we found these genes to be moderately upregulated in WT plants 72 h after inoculation with B. cinerea suspension supplemented with shn1-1D cutin monomers, as compared to their expression in shn1-1D plants inoculated with B. cinerea alone, and even to their expression in inoculated WT plants (Figure 6B). Genes were upregulated, but to an appropriate level that supported resistance. Furthermore, when 0.04 g of cutin monomers, extracted from either shn1-1D or the WT, were applied alone on WT leaves, we also observed that the shn1-1D cutin monomers cause moderate upregulation of PAL1 as compared to WT cutin monomers (Figure 6C). These results suggested that the composition of shn1-1D cutin monomer may contribute to the magnitude of the defense activation..
PMC3511161	Results. . Rescue of the seedling-lethal apyrase double knockout phenotype with tagged AtAPY1. One objective was to localize AtAPY1 at the subcellular level to learn how the protein exerts its function in plant growth. Tagging AtAPY1 was chosen over raising antibodies against it because AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 are so identical in their amino acid (aa) sequence: There is only one six-aa-stretch in AtAPY1 (aa 44-49) that has four different and two similar aa to the corresponding sequence in AtAPY2. [43]. All other stretches of differences between the two sequences comprise only one or two aa.. Among the tags available, the SNAP-tag. [44,45] seemed the most suitable. As an O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase, SNAP binds covalently to benzylguanine-based substrates. There are a large number of substrates coupled to different fluorescent dyes and other labels commercially available making the SNAP-tag a versatile tool for localization studies. The expression of AtAPY1-SNAP was placed under the control of the native promoter region, because overexpression can lead to localization artifacts. Despite this risk, another tagged AtAPY1 version, AtAPY1-GFP, was fused to the strong cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter because expression levels of NTPDases are generally low. [46].. The SNAP- or GFP-tag was fused to the C-terminus of AtAPY1 to avoid losing the tag by a possible N-terminal cleavage in a subcellular targeting process. Since tags can impair protein function and lead to mislocalization. [47], a complementation strategy was performed. The knockout of AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 (DKO) is seedling-lethal. [18]. A DKO seedling should survive if it is complemented with a tagged AtAPY1 that is functional and correctly localized. However, the use of the 35S promoter made the rescue of the DKO mutant with AtAPY1-GFP impossible as confirmed experimentally, because this promoter is turned off in pollen. [48]. Without AtAPY1-GFP in the DKO pollen, no progeny will form, because the presence of either AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 is prerequisite for pollen to germinate. [17]. In order to overcome this hurdle, partially complemented apyrase apy2 SKO plants (= +/apy1; apy2/apy2; SPIK::AtAPY2) were used as the genetic background for transformation with each tagged AtAPY1 construct. These plants carried AtAPY2 under the control of the pollen-specific promoter SPIK which ensured the survival of the DKO pollen.. DNA was isolated from progeny of the partially complemented SKO plants containing either AtAPY1::AtAPY1-SNAP or 35S::AtAPY1-GFP and used for genotyping by PCR. Several DKO plants without a WT AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 gene, but with a tagged apyrase construct were identified hereafter called DKO-SNAP and DKO-GFP, respectively. The PCR analysis of two such mutants is shown in Figure. 1A. The SPIK::AtAPY2 construct was always present in the DKO-GFP mutants as expected, but interestingly also in the DKO-SNAP mutants. One possible explanation is that some regulatory elements necessary for optimal expression in pollen were missing in the chosen promoter region. The promoter region used previously for AtAPY1::GUS analyses. [12,17,18] was 1kb longer at the 3end including almost the entire gene (At3g04090) upstream of AtAPY1. Since the gene At3g04090 was deemed unnecessary for successful complementation, it was mostly excluded in the AtAPY1::AtAPY1-SNAP construct.. . Figure 1. . Identification of apyrase double knockouts complemented with AtAPY1::AtAPY1-SNAP or 35S::AtAPY1-GFP. (A) Genomic DNA was isolated from DKO plants complemented with either AtAPY1::AtAPY1-SNAP (DKO-SNAP) or 35S::AtAPY1-GFP (DKO-GFP) and subjected to PCR analysis. The PCR products for AtAPY1 (1.0kb), AtAPY2 (0.9kb), the T-DNA null mutations apy1 (0.7kb) and apy2 (0.6kb), AtAPY1-SNAP (0.6kb), AtAPY1-GFP (0.7kb) and SPIK::AtAPY2 (0.4kb) were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA from plants which had been tested positive for the respective amplification products before served as the positive controls (+). The negative PCR controls (-) were run without addition of any DNA template. (B) The phenotype of the WT, the DKO and the DKO rescued with either the SNAP- or GFP-tagged AtAPY1 are shown. The genetic backgrounds are represented by colored symbols. Images of 8-d- (WT), 14-d- (DKO), 7-d- (DKO-SNAP), 7-d-old (DKO-GFP) seedlings and of 30-d-old adult plants were taken. Scale bars equal 1cm.. . . . To confirm that the SNAP- and GFP-tagged AtAPY1 could rescue the lethal DKO seedling phenotype, the seedling phenotype of complemented SKO and DKO plants in comparison with the WT and DKO seedlings was analyzed (Figure. 1B). SKO-SNAP (+/+; apy2/apy2; SPIK::AtAPY2; AtAPY1::AtAPY1-SNAP) and SKO-GFP (apy1/apy1; +/+; SPIK::AtAPY2; 35S::AtAPY1-GFP) plants were included in the study to check for possible dominant negative effects of the tagged apyrase on the WT phenotype. DKO seedlings without a construct coding for a tagged AtAPY1 had an abnormal phenotype with fleshy cotyledons and no root (Figure. 1B;. [18]). These seedlings did not develop beyond this stage. DKO plants expressing AtAPY1-SNAP or AtAPY1-GFP, on the other hand, showed no phenotypical differences to WT plants (Figure. 1B) and SKO mutants (data not shown).. The lethal DKO (apy1/apy1; apy2/apy2; SPIK::AtAPY2) could be rescued by transformation with AtAPY1-SNAP or AtAPY1-GFP making the DKO-SNAP and DKO-GFP plants suitable tools for localization studies.. . . AtAPY1 is present in punctate structures, but not at the plasma membrane or extracellular space. For localization of AtAPY1 at the subcellular level by confocal microscopy, living DKO-SNAP seedlings were incubated with SNAP-compatible fluorescent substrates to label the AtAPY1-SNAP fusion protein. Two cell-permeable, fluorescent substrates were used: red fluorescent tetramethylrhodamine-Star and the green fluorescent BG-505 (both kindly provided by Andreas Brecht, formerly Covalys Biosciences, Basel, Switzerland). Although specific labeling of fusion proteins in vivo was successful in yeast. [49] and animal as well as human cell cultures. [50-52], a high background made the detection of AtAPY1-SNAP-specific signals in Arabidopsis seedlings impossible. The tested dyes passed the cell wall and entered the cell, but even 14-h washing steps could not remove the excess fluorescent substrate (data not shown).. Therefore, indirect immunofluorescence was chosen as a different approach. DKO-SNAP seedlings were fixed. After cell wall digestion and plasma membrane permeabilization, they were incubated with primary antibodies against the SNAP-tag. Following several washing steps, FITC-labeled secondary antibodies were added to visualize AtAPY1-SNAP for the CLSM. The background was low, but no specific signals could be detected (data not shown). To increase the fluorescent signal, the tyramide signal amplification (TSA) technique was applied. [53]. This technique employs peroxidase activity to covalently couple a large number of labeled substrates in the immediate vicinity. Therefore, instead of FITC-labeled secondary antibodies, HRP-labeled antibodies were added in combination with FITC-coupled tyramides. TSA improved the signal-to-noise ratio and intracellular dot-like structures became visible in DKO-SNAP seedlings (Figure. 2A) which were not found in the WT (Figure. 2B). Root hairs were selected as suitable cell types for localization, because promoter-glucuronidase analyses suggested that AtAPY1 is expressed strongly in root hairs as well as in guard cells among other cell types. [12,18].. . Figure 2. . AtAPY1 is present in intracellular dot-like structures, but absent from the extracellular space. CLSM (A, B, E-J) and fluorescence microscopy (C, D) images of various cell types are depicted. All WT control images were captured using the identical CLSM settings as for the corresponding images of the transgenic plants. The FITC, Alexa Fluor 488 and GFP fluorescence is shown in green, the chlorophyll autofluorescence in magenta. The fluorescence signals are overlaid with a bright field image in A, B, E and F. Scale bars=20mum. (A, B) Root hairs of DKO-SNAP and WT seedlings were fixed and successively incubated with alpha-SNAP antibodies and secondary alpha-rabbit IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase. FITC tyramides were added to amplify the fluorescence signal. The parameters of the indirect immunofluorescence detection were modified in multiple independent experiments until FITC-specific fluorescence signals as shown here were obtained. (C, D)Two hundred-nm Tokuyasu cryo-sections through root tips of AtAPY1-GFP expressing seedlings were fixed and incubated with (C) or without (D) alpha-GFP antibodies. All samples were incubated with secondary alpha-rabbit Fab fragments coupled with Alexa Fluor 488. The pictures (C) and (D) were taken with the same exposure times. (E, F) Two guard cells of a 35S::AtAPY1-GFP transgenic and WT seedling are depicted. The dot-like green fluorescent signals were obtained in at least 20 independent live imagings. (G) A protoplast expressing AtAPY1-GFP and a WT protoplast (H), both prepared from cotyledons, were imaged. Overlays of the green and magenta fluorescent signals are shown. These images represent the results from three independent protoplastations. (I, J) The GFP fluorescence and the bright field image of the same epidermal section of a cotyledon from an AtAPY1-GFP overexpressing seedling grown under alkaline conditions are shown representative of the imaging results from three seedlings. Doughnut- or horseshoe-shaped fluorescent structures typical of Golgi stacks imaged from the top are indicated by white arrows.. . . . To overcome the weak expression levels of AtAPY1, the indirect immunofluorescence approach was repeated with transgenic plants expressing AtAPY1-GFP under the control of the strong 35S promoter. We used primary antibodies against GFP and secondary Alexa Fluor 488-coupled antibodies in two different approaches: 1. Post-embedding labeling of 200-nm-thin Tokuyasu cryo-sections (Figure. 2C, D), and 2. Pre-embedding labeling followed by embedding in Technovit 7100 resin and sectioning (Additional file. 3). In both experiments, the intracellular punctate signals could be confirmed in the root (Figure. 2C) and in root hairs (Additional file. 3). No signals were detected in the cell wall and at the plasma membrane and in the control without primary antibody (Figure. 2D).. To verify the imaging data obtained by immunofluorescence, a second detection method was used. The transgenic plants expressing AtAPY1GFP were imaged in vivo by CLSM. Here, the same intracellular punctate pattern as found before in AtAPY1-SNAP and AtAPY1-GFP expressing plants was observed in guard cells (Figure. 2E), cotyledon epidermis (Additional file. 4A), hypocotyls (Additional file. 4B) and roots (Additional file. 4C). The WT control did not present this punctate pattern as shown exemplarily for WT guard cells (Figure. 2F). Expression of the GFP-tag alone led to cytoplasmic staining. [28].. The method of live imaging of GFP-tagged proteins is suitable to detect apyrase in the cell wall as shown for apoplastic apyrases in other plant species. [16,54]. But since AtAPY1 was expected to be localized extracellularly and since GFP does not fluoresce atpH 5.0. [55], a weak AtAPY1-GFP signal could be missed if the tag were exposed to the acidic environment of the cell wall. To provide an optimal pH for GFP fluorescence in the extracellular environment, WT protoplasts and those expressing AtAPY1-GFP were prepared from cotyledons and imaged at pH 7.6. As before, intracellular GFP signals were found (Figure. 2G) which did not appear in the WT control (Figure. 2H), but the plasma membrane of the transgenic protoplasts did not fluoresce (Figure. 2H). This result ruled out the possibility that AtAPY1 was anchored in the plasma membrane. However, protoplastation represents severe stress for the cells which could have caused down regulation of AtAPY1 and/or degradation or internalization of AtAPY1. In addition, AtAPY1 was a possibly soluble protein in the cell wall and in this case the digestion of the cell wall during protoplast preparation would have led to a loss of the AtAPY1-GFP signal. Therefore, cells with intact walls were imaged at a pH suitable for GFP fluorescence (Figure. 2I, J). Seedlings expressing 35S::AtAPY1-GFP were grown in liquid culture at pH of 8.1 instead of 5.7. The higher pH in the culture medium is known to recover GFP fluorescence in the apoplast. [38]. However, even under these conditions, no extracellular GFP signal was detectable (Figure. 2I). In addition, 35S::AtAPY1-GFP seedlings were cultured under normal conditions to minimize any impact the alkaline culture medium may have on AtAPY1 distribution and infiltrated with buffer of pH 7.5 just for imaging. Again no extracellular signals were found in more than 30 independent experiments (data not shown).. Both detection methods, immunofluorescence and in vivo imaging, revealed the same punctate structures, but no signals at the plasma membrane or in the extracellular space.. . . AtAPY1 is localized in the Golgi apparatus. At higher magnifications, some of the AtAPY1-specific punctate signals appeared as doughnut- or horseshoe-shaped structures (see Figure. 2I). This morphology is typical of Golgi stacks viewed in the middle of the main cisternae from the top. [56]. In addition, the observed size between 0.5 to 1mum across matched the expected size of Golgi stacks. [57]. In order to corroborate that AtAPY1 was localized in these organelles, the dye FM4-64 was applied. FM4-64 is endocytosed by the cell, sequentially staining the plasma membrane, endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, but not the Golgi apparatus. [58]. Imaging FM4-64-infiltrated 35S::AtAPY1-GFP seedlings did not reveal any co-localization of the fluorescent dye and the GFP signal, even 120min after the infiltration (Figure. 3A and corresponding scatterplot in Figure. 3E).. . Figure 3. . Identification of AtAPY1-positive structures as Golgi. CLSM images of epidermal cells from cotyledons are shown. The GFP fluorescence is shown in green, the FM4-64 (A), YFP (B, D) and RFP (C) fluorescence in magenta. The images from the two fluorescence detection channels were merged with the Co-localization Finder plugin (= overlay) and co-localization of the green and magenta signals resulted in white spots. Scale bars=20mum. (A) Transgenic seedlings expressing AtAPY1-GFP were treated with 15muM FM4-64 by vacuum-infiltration. A section of the lower epidermis is shown after 120min of treatment. (B) Two guard cells of a transgenic seedling co-expressing AtAPY1-GFP and YFP-Rab E1d are shown. (C, D) Transgenic seedlings co-expressing AtAPY1-GFP and either RFP-MEMB12 or YFP-SYP32 were imaged. (E) The distribution of the green and magenta pixels in the dual-channel overlay images in A-D were analyzed with the ImageJ Colocalization Threshold and Coloc2 tool. The x-axes represent the intensities of the green pixels from the GFP channel (AtAPY1) and the y-axes from the magenta channel (FM4-64, Rab E1d, MEMB12 or SYP32). For each scatterplot, the intensities are given as the pixel grey values ranging from 0 to 255. Co-localization clusters the pixels from both channels along a diagonal line. The maximal theoretical value for the Pearsons correlation coefficient (Rr) is 1.0.. . . . As an additional negative endosomal control, co-localization with the GTPase Rab E1d was studied. There is some controversy in the literature over the designation of Rab E1d as a marker protein for the Golgi. [59] or the post-Golgi/endosomal compartment. [32]. However, there is consensus that Rab E1d primarily co-localizes with rat sialyltransferase. [59,60], a trans-Golgi and/or trans-Golgi network marker protein. [61], and that it also associates with the plasma membrane (PM). [60,62]. Therefore, Rab E1d is believed to play a role in the trafficking of secretory vesicles from the Golgi to the PM. [59,60].. In transgenic plants co-expressing YFP-Rab E1d and AtAPY1-GFP, no overlap of the YFP and GFP fluorescence was found (Figure. 3B and corresponding scatterplot in Figure. 3E). The lack of overlap not only suggests the absence of AtAPY1-GFP in endosomes, but also ruled out crosstalk between the GFP and YFP detection channels. In order to confirm that the chosen GFP and YFP settings were specific for the detection of the GFP and YFP fluorescence, respectively, transgenic plants expressing only one of the two fluorophores were imaged sequentially with the GFP and YFP settings. When imaging epidermal cells from the AtAPY1-GFP expressing plant with the GFP settings, the familiar dot-like structures appeared in the GFP detection channel (Additional file. 5A). Taking an image of the identical epidermal section with the YFP settings, however, did not deliver this punctate pattern (Additional file. 5A). The same imaging experiment with a plant expressing YFP-SYP32 only, showed negligible bleed-through of the YFP fluorescence into the GFP detection channel (Additional file. 5B). These control experiments demonstrated the specificity of the GFP and YFP detection settings.. In a direct localization approach, the occurrence of AtAPY1-GFP in the Golgi apparatus was investigated by co-localization with three known Arabidopsis Golgi-resident proteins. MEMB12 (Membrin 12) and SYP32 (Syntaxin of plants 32) are SNARE proteins localized in the Golgi apparatus. [63]. Got1p (Golgi transport 1 protein) was found in the Golgi membranes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae[64] and its homolog in Arabidopsis was also localized in the Golgi. [32]. Transgenic plants co-expressing AtAPY1-GFP and either the Golgi marker RFP-MEMB12 (Figure. 3C), the YFP-SYP32 (Figure. 3D) or YFP-Got1p homolog (Additional file. 6) were analyzed by confocal microscopy. The fluorescence of all three Golgi marker proteins overlapped with the AtAPY1 fluorescence, localizing AtAPY1-GFP to the Golgi apparatus.. To exclude or confirm a co-localization not only by eye, the ImageJ software was applied. The overlays of the images from the two detection channels were used to generate scatterplots and to calculate the Pearsons correlation coefficient (Rr) of the two fluorescent signals (Figure. 3E and Additional file. 6). Rr values>0.5 indicate co-localization. [65], verifying co-localization of all three marker proteins RFP-MEMB12, YFP-SYP32 and YFP-Got1p homolog with AtAPY1-GFP.. In order to confirm the co-localization results, AtAPY1-GFP was labeled with gold particles using alpha-GFP primary antibodies and secondary gold-coupled secondary antibodies. Electron microscopy of Tokuyasu cryo-sections through roots revealed weak, but specific staining of Golgi stacks (Figure. 4A,B). In sections through 56 Golgi compartments (48 labeled, 8 unlabeled) equaling an area of 11.8mum2, 8.3 gold particles per mum2 were counted. Considering only labeled Golgi compartments increased the value to 9.8 particles per mum2. By comparison, only 0.37 and 0.07 gold particles per mum2 were found in sections through 88 mitochondria (= 14mum2) and 12 nuclei (= 27mum2), respectively. Multivesicular bodies (MVB) were also positively immunolabeled by gold particles (Figure. 4C) which most likely reflects the transport of some AtAPY1-GFP to the vacuole as seen in other GFP-overexpressing plants. [59] rather than a functional role of AtAPY1 in this prevacuolar compartment. No immunolabeling of any other cellular compartment including the cell wall was found (Figure. 4D). In summary, the immunogold labeling studies of AtAPY1-GFP confirmed its localization in the Golgi and gave no indication of an extracellular occurrence.. . Figure 4. . Confirmation of the Golgi localization of AtAPY1 by immunogold labeling. (A-D) Transverse Tokuyasu-cryo-sections through root tips were imaged by TEM after imunogold labeling of AtAPY1-GFP using alpha-GFP antibodies (Torrey Pines) and Protein A 10-nm gold. Arrows mark gold particles. Independent experiments with Protein A 6-nm gold gave the same localization results presented here. Both approaches were repeated three times. Abbreviations: cw, cell wall, g, golgi stack, mvb, multivesicular body. Scale bars equal 200nm in A and 500nm in B-D.. . . . . . AtAPY1 has the substrate specificity typical of an endo-, not an ecto-apyrase. If the Golgi localization of AtAPY1 were correct, AtAPY1 should exhibit the substrate specificity typical of Golgi apyrases. Therefore, the activity of AtAPY1-GFP was tested in the presence of known apyrase substrates at pH 6.5 which equals the pH found in the Golgi. [55]. AMP is not a substrate for apyrases and for this reason served as a negative control. AtAPY1-GFP did not hydrolyze ATP and ADP, the typical substrates of ecto-apyrases. [46], but the nucleotides uridine diphosphate (UDP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inosine diphosphate (IDP) (Figure. 5). No activity was detectable in the presence of all other NTPs or NDPs (Figure. 5) and AMP (data not shown). Hydrolysis of these three NDPs matches the substrate specificity of other plant Golgi apyrases, e. g. from rice (Oryza sativa). [66] and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). [67].. . Figure 5. . Substrate specificity of AtAPY1-GFP. The activity of AtAPY1-GFP in the presence of various substrates at pH 6.5 was measured. Different letters above the columns indicate mean values that are significantly different from one other (p<0.05, Tukey test). Error bars represent standard deviations of duplicate measurements from one reaction (see Methods). The data are representative of five activity assays with independent protein extracts. Abbreviation: Pi, inorganic phosphate.. . . . In order to investigate the possibility that the substrate specificity was pH-dependent and that it would change in favor of ATP and ADP once AtAPY1 reached the apoplast, the activity assay of AtAPY1-GFP was repeated at pH 5.5, the pH typically found in the cell wall. [68]. However, the three diphosphates UDP, GDP and IDP remained the only substrates (Additional file. 7). Therefore, the determined substrate specificity substantiated the results that AtAPY1 was not observed in the cell wall, but in the Golgi.. . . AtAPY1 is an integral membrane protein. One objective was to determine if AtAPY1 was a soluble protein in the lumen of the Golgi or, as implied by the TMHMM prediction program. [69], a Golgi membrane protein with an uncleaved signal sequence at the N-terminus serving as a transmembrane anchor (Figure. 6A). This prediction was supported by the immunogold labeling results which suggested a membrane association of the protein (Figure. 4A-C).. . Figure 6. . Analysis of the solubility of AtAPY1-GFP.(A) The output of the TMHMM prediction program. [69] is shown. The AtAPY1 aa sequence is represented along the x-axis with the N-terminal aa being the first residue. The probability for each aa to appear within a transmembrane domain (TM) is given. One TM is predicted which comprises the aa 21-43. (B) Microsomal membranes were prepared from transgenic plants containing 35S::AtAPY1-GFP. Equal amounts of membrane fractions were treated either with extraction buffer, 0.2% SDS, 2M NaCl, 0.2M Na2CO3 or 4M urea. After a 30-min treatment, the proteins were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000g. The pellet fractions (P) and the supernatants (S) were separated in a 8% SDS polyacrylamide gel, blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with alpha-GFP antibodies. The molecular weights of the protein standard are given in kDa. The AtAPY1-GFP protein (80kDa) and a second band at 27kDa (arrow) were detected with alpha-mouse IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase. Similar results were obtained in three experiments with independent protein extracts.. . . . Microsomal membranes were isolated from transgenic AtAPY1-GFP seedlings and their purity was verified with antibodies against marker proteins for cytosolic and insoluble proteins (Additional file. 8). The microsomal membranes were treated with various solubilizing agents and then analyzed for any solubilized proteins. Using alpha-GFP antibodies, a major signal was observed at the expected molecular mass of AtAPY1-GFP (80kDa) and a minor signal at 27kDa (Figure. 6B). The smaller protein most likely represents a degradation product of AtAPY1-GFP resulting from the protein extraction procedure. If the microsomal membranes were left untreated, AtAPY1-GFP was detected in the membrane fraction (Figure. 6B), suggesting that the protein was membrane-bound. In support of this finding, the detergent SDS released the majority of the AtAPY1-GFP protein from the membranes (Figure. 6B). In order to differentiate between AtAPY1 being a peripheral or an integral membrane protein, the microsomal membranes were subjected to high salt (2M NaCl), alkaline (0.2M Na2CO3) and denaturing (4M urea) conditions. Peripheral proteins are removed from membranes by urea which disturbs protein-protein interactions or by high salt and alkaline treatments which disrupt electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, respectively. Except for trace amounts, the salt and Na2CO3 treatment did shift AtAPY1 from the pellet fraction to the supernatant (Figure. 6B) as expected for an integral membrane protein. AtAPY1 is also not a Golgi soluble protein, because AtAPY1 remained in the pellet fraction after Na2CO3 treatment which is known to leach the soluble proteins from the microsomal lumen into the supernatant fraction as shown in. [70]. Urea released some AtAPY1-GFP protein into the supernatant, but most of the protein remained in the membrane fraction (Figure. 6B). Although transmembrane proteins are generally not extracted by urea at all, type II integral proteins seem to be less tightly associated with the membrane than proteins with multiple transmembrane domains. [71].. In summary, AtAPY1 showed the characteristics of a single-pass type II membrane protein..
PMC3921138	Results. . Microsomes from Populus developing wood exhibit glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity. As a first step toward molecular and biochemical characterization of methyltransferases responsible for GlcA methytlation in xylan in Populus, we examined glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity in developing wood of Populus. Microsomes isolated from Populus stems were incubated with S-adenosyl-L-methionine, radiolabeled on the methyl group, as the methyl donor and GlcA-substituted Xyl4 as the acceptor. While the microsomes exhibited no methyltransferase activity in the absence of the exogenous acceptor, a high level of methyltransferase activity was detected in the presence of the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor (Fig. 1A). This methyltransferase activity was both time- and protein concentration-dependent (Fig. 1B, C). The reaction products were verified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The control reaction with the addition of the acceptor but no methyl donor exhibited an ion peak [M+Na]+ at mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 745 that corresponds to the acceptor, GlcA-substituted Xyl4 (Fig. 1D). In the reaction with the addition of both the methyl donor and the acceptor, a signal peak at m/z 759 corresponding to MeGlcA-substituted Xyl4 was evident in addition to the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor peak (m/z 745) (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that the Populus stem microsomes possess a methyltransferase activity capable of transferring the methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine onto the GlcA-substituted xylooligosaccharide acceptor.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0087370.g001. Figure 1. . Detection of glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity in Populus stem microsomes.. Microsomes isolated from developing stems of Populus trichocarpa were incubated with the methyl donor, 14C-radiolabeled S-adenosylmethionine, and the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor. The methyltransferase activity (CPM) was measured by the transfer of the radiolabeled methyl group onto the acceptor. Error bars in (A), (B) and (C) denote the se of two biological replicates. (A) Populus stem microsomes exhibit a methyltransferase activity toward the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor. Microsomes (200 g protein) were used for each reaction unless otherwise indicated. (B) Time course of the methyltransferase activity exhibited by the microsomes. (C) The methyltransferase activity increases with increasing amount of microsomes. (D) MALDI analysis of the reaction products catalyzed by the methyltransferase activity in Populus microsomes. Microsomes were incubated with the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor in the absence (top panel) or presence (lower panel) of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The ions [M+Na]+ at m/z 745 and 759 correspond to the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor [(GlcA)Xyl4] and the methylated acceptor with an increase of 14 D [(MeGlcA)Xyl4], respectively. The ions at m/z 767 and 781 are attributed to the doubly sodiated species [M+2Na]+ of (GlcA)Xyl4 and (MeGlcA)Xyl4, respectively. The identity of the ion at m/z 787 is not known.. . . . . . The expression of PtrGXM genes is PtrWND2-induced and wood-associated. To search for genes that are responsible for the above observed glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity in Populus stems, we first analyzed the expression patterns of Populus DUF579 genes that are close homologs of Arabidopsis GXM genes. There are 11 DUF579 genes (Fig. 2A) in the Populus genome, of which four are closely grouped together with the Arabidopsis GXM1, GXM2 and GXM3 genes known to encode glucuronoxylan methyltransferases. These four Populus DUF579 genes (namely PtrGXM1/2/3/4) apparently fall into two pairs (PtrGXM1/PtrGXM2 and PtrGXM3/PtrGXM4), each of which was likely originated from genome duplication [28]. All four PtrGXM genes were found to be highly expressed in Populus stems undergoing secondary growth (Fig. 2B). In addition, the expression of PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2 and PtrGXM3 was shown to be significantly upregulated (Fig. 2C) in transgenic Populus plants overexpressing PtrWND2B, which is a transcriptional master switch activating secondary wall biosynthesis during wood formation [26], [27]. In situ hybridization further demonstrated that the PtrGXM genes were predominantly expressed in cells undergoing secondary wall thickening, including developing secondary xylem and phloem fibers (Fig. 3).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0087370.g002. Figure 2. . Phylogenetic and expression analyses of four Populus GXM genes.. (A) Phylogenetic relationship of DUF579-containing proteins from Populus and Arabidopsis. The amino acid sequences of DUF579-containing proteins from Populus and Arabidopsis were aligned using ClustalW and their phylogenetic relationship was analyzed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA5.2 [40]. Bootstrap values resulted from 1,000 replicates are shown at the nodes.

Figure 3. . In situ hybridization analysis of PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2, PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 mRNAs in Populus stems.. Cross sections of stems were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes of PtrGXM1 (A), PtrGXM2 (B), PtrGXM3 (C), and PtrGXM4 (D) or the sense probe of PtrGXM1 as the control (E). The hybridized sections were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies and the hybridization signals are shown as purple color. co, cortex; pf, phloem fiber; sx, secondary xylem. Bar in (A)=160 m for (A) to (E).. . . . . . PtrGXM proteins are targeted to the Golgi. To further substantiate their involvement in xylan biosynthesis, we exmined whether PtrGXM proteins are targeted to the Golgi, in which xylan biosynthesis occurs. PtrGXMs are typical type II membrane proteins containing one transmembrane helix as predicted by the TMHMM2.0 program for prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/service/TMHMM-2.0) (Fig. 4A). To examine the subcellular localization of PtrGXMs, we coexpressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts yellow fluorescence protein-tagged PtrGXMs together with cyan fluorescence protein-tagged FRA8, a family GT47 glycosyltransferase known to be located in the Golgi [29]. While the control protoplasts expressing YFP alone showed fluorescent signals throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B, C), the protoplasts expressing PtrGXM-YFP exhibited punctate signals, which were colocalized with the FRA8-CFP signals (Fig. 4D-S). These results demonstrate that PtrGXMs are localized in the Golgi, where xylan biosynthesis occurs.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0087370.g004. Figure 4. . Subcellular localization of PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2, PtrGXM3, and PtrGXM4.. PtrGXM proteins tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts, and the fluorescence signals were detected with a laser confocal microscope.

PtrGXMs are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis GXMs. The wood-associated expression of PtrGXMs and their Golgi-localization indicate that PtrGXMs most likely play a role in the biosynthesis of xylan. Considering the fact that the four PtrGXMs are phylogenetically closely grouped together with the Arabidopsis glucuronoxylan methyltransferases GXM1/2/3, we hypothesized that PtrGXMs are also glucuronoxylan methyltransferases involved in the methylation of GlcA side chains of xylan. Therefore, we tested the ability of PtrGXMs to complement the Arabidopsis gxm1/2/3 triple mutant. The full-length PtrGXM cDNAs driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were transformed into the gxm1/2/3 mutant, and more than 64 independently transgenic lines for each construct were generated. The expression of PtrGXMs in 8 representative transgenic lines for each construct was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR analysis of PtrGXM transcripts (data not shown). Microsomes were isolated from stems of six-week-old transgenic plants and subsequently used for glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity assays. The glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activities from 8 representative transgenic lines for each expression construct of PtrGXMs were shown in Fig. 5. It was evident that although the gxm1/2/3 mutant exhibited a loss of glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity, the gxm1/2/3 lines expressing PtrGXMs showed a partial restoration of glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0087370.g005. Figure 5. . Assay of the glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity in the Arabidopsis gxm1/2/3 triple mutant overexpressing PtrGXMs.. The full-length cDNAs of PtrGXMs driven by the CaMV 35S promoter were introduced into the gxm1/2/3 mutant and the inflorescence stems of 6-week-old transgenic plants were used for microsome isolation. Microsomes were incubated with 14C-labeled S-adenosylmethionine and the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor. The methyltransferase activity (CPM) was measured by the amount of 14C-labeled methyl group transferred onto the acceptor. The methyltransferase activities from 8 independent transgenic lines were shown for each PtrGXM overexpression construct. Error bars denote the se of two independent assays.. . . . To find out whether expression of PtrGXMs restored the GlcA methylation of xylan in the gxm1/2/3 mutant, we isolated xylan from the pooled stems of the 8 transgenic lines as shown in Fig. 5 for each expression contruct of PtrGXMs. The isolated xylan was digested with xylanase to generate xylooligosaccharides, which were subsequently subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig. 6). Xylooligosaccharides from wild-type xylan exhibited a prominent ion peak at m/z 759, which corresponds to MeGlcA-substituted Xyl4, and a less prominent ion peak at m/z 745, which corresponds to GlcA-substituted Xyl4. Simultaneous mutations of the Arabidopsis GXM1, GXM2 and GXM3 genes in the gxm1/2/3 triple mutant resulted in a complete loss of the ion peak (m/z 759) attributed to MeGlcA-substituted Xyl4. As a result, the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 peak at m/z 745 was significantly elevated in the gxm1/2/3 mutant compared with that in the wild type. Expression of PtrGXMs in gxm1/2/3 led to a partial restoration of the ion peak at m/z 759 corresponding to MeGlcA-substituted Xyl4 (Fig. 6). The partial restoration of the GlcA methylation was further verified by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 7). The wild-type xylan displayed resonances characteristic of H1 of GlcA and MeGlcA side chains at 5.31 and 5.29 ppm, respectively, and H5 of GlcA and MeGlcA side chains at 4.42 and 4.39 ppm, respectively. It also exhibited resonances at 4.63 and 4.46 ppm that are attributed to H1 of branched and unbranched backbone xylosyl residues, respectively. Xylan from the gxm1/2/3 mutant lacked all the resonances attributed to MeGlcA side chains, including H1 of MeGlcA, H5 of MeGlcA, and H1 of MeGlcA-branched beta-Xyl. Analysis of xylan from gxm1/2/3 lines expressing PtrGXMs revealed a partial restoration of all the resonances attributed to MeGlcA side chains (Fig. 7). Integration analysis of the GlcA and MeGlcA signal peaks revealed that although the gxm1/2/3 mutant completely lacks GlcA methylation in xylan, 8% to 21% of the GlcA side chains in xylan were methylated in gxm1/2/3 expressing PtrGXMs (Table 1). The resonance intensities for the xylan reducing end tetrasaccharide sequence, beta-d-Xyl-(13)-alpha-l-Rha-(12)-alpha-d-GalA-(14)-d-Xyl (H1 of 3-linked beta-D-Xyl, H1 of alpha-L-Rha, H1 of alpha-D-GalA, H2 of alpha-L-Rha, and H4 of alpha-D-GalA), were unaltered in gxm1/2/3 expressing PtrGXMs compared with the gxm1/2/3 mutant and the wild type. Together, these results provide genetic evidence demonstrating that expression of each of the four PtrGXM genes in the gxm1/2/3 mutant is able to partially restore the glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity and the GlcA methylation in xylan, indicating that PtrGXMs are functional orthologs of the Arabidopsis GXMs catalyzing the methylation of GlcA side chains in xylan.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0087370.g006. Figure 6. . MALDI-TOF mass spectra of xylooligosaccharides generated by xylanase digestion of xylan from the gxm1/2/3 mutant overexpressing PtrGXMs.. The ions at m/z 745 and 759 are attributed to xylotetrasaccharides bearing a GlcA residue [(GlcA)Xyl4] and a methylated GlcA residue [(MeGlcA)Xyl4], respectively. The ion at m/z 761 corresponds to the xylan reducing end pentasaccharide, beta-d-Xyl-(14)-beta-d-Xyl-(13)-alpha-l-Rha-(12)-alpha-d-GalA-(14)-d-Xyl (X-X-R-GA-X).

Recombinant PtrGXM proteins exhibit glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity. To provide definitive proof that PtrGXMs are glucuronoxylan methyltransferases, we examined the glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity of purified recombinant PtrGXM proteins. PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2, PtrGXM3, and PtrGXM4 fused with maltose binding protein were successfully expressed in and purified from E. coli (Fig. 8A). Recombinant PtrGXMs were incubated with radiolabeled S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and GlcA-substituted Xyl4 as the acceptor. It was found that all four recombinant PtrGXMs exhibited a methyltransferase activity capable of transferring the radiolabeled methyl group onto the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor (Fig. 8B). In contrast, they were unable to transfer the radiolabeled methyl group onto unsubstituted Xyl4, GlcA, or UDP-GlcA. Purified maltose binding protein alone did not show any methyltransferase activity toward any of the substrates tested. The PtrGXM-catalyzed reaction products were further analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. It was evident that in addition to the prominent ion peak at m/z 745 attributed to the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor, the PtrGXM-catalyzed reaction products had another noticeable ion peak at m/z 759 corresponding to MeGlcA-substituted Xyl4 (Fig. 9). The control reaction incubated with maltose binding protein contained only the ion peak for the acceptor (m/z 745). These results unequivocally demonstrate that PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2, PtrGXM3, and PtrGXM4 are glucuronoxylan methyltransferases catalyzing the transfer of the methyl group onto GlcA side chains in xylan.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0087370.g008.

MALDI spectra of the reaction products catalyzed by PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2, PtrGXM3, and PtrGXM4 recombinant proteins.. Purified recombinant PtrGXMs were incubated with the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 [(GlcA)Xyl4] acceptor and the S-adenosylmethionine methyl donor and the reaction products were purified and subjected to MALDI analysis. Note the appearance of a new ion peak at m/z 759 corresponding to (MeGlcA)Xyl4 (red arrows) with an increase of 14 D relative to the (GlcA)Xyl4 acceptor (m/z 745) in the products of reactions incubated with PtrGXMs but not with MBP. The ions at m/z 767 and 781 are attributed to the doubly sodiated species [M+2Na]+ of (GlcA)Xyl4 and (MeGlcA)Xyl4, respectively.. . . . We further analyzed the biochemical properties of the recombinant PtrGXMs. The glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activities of PtrGXMs were both time- and protein concentration-dependent (Fig. 10A, B). The optimal temperature for the reactions was 37C for PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2 and 45C for PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 (Fig. 10C). To examine the substrate binding affinities of PtrGXMs, we investigated their kinetic properties using different concentrations of the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor. The Km and Vmax values were calculated by Lineweaver-Burk analysis. It was found that the transfer of the methyl group onto GlcA-substituted Xyl4 by PtrGXMs was dependent on the acceptor concentration (Fig. 11) with apparent Km values of 3.25, 3.98, 0.30 and 0.29 mM and Vmax of 145, 123, 353 and 737 pmol/min/mg protein for PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2, PtrGXM3, and PtrGXM4, respectively. These results indicate that PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 exhibit much higher substrate affinities for the GlcA-substituted Xyl4 acceptor than PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0087370.g010.

PMC5266714	Results. . At5g02890 encodes a putative transferase with an unknown function. The open reading frame (1062 bp) of At5g02890 encodes a protein consisting of 353 amino acids, which is annotated as a putative transferase. By transcriptome and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, we found that the expression levels of At5g02890 were highly increased in OE-CER26 lines (Figure S1). To predict the possible function of At5g02890 in plants, we used the sequence of the full-length At5g02890 protein as a query in a BLASTP search for homologs in the following six public databases: the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, http://www.arabidopsis.org/), the Brassica Database (http://brassicadb.org/brad/), the Brassica oleracea Genomics Database (http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/index.html), the B. napus Genomics Database (http://brassicadb.org/brad/datasets/pub/Genomes/Brassica_napus/), and the Rice Genome Annotation Database (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/). In total, 35 close homologs of At5g02890 were obtained (Table S2). Subsequently, we constructed a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree with these homologous protein sequences. At5g02890 and its homologs were grouped into two main clades: clade I contains 18 homologs from seven species with levels of sequence identity to At5g02890 ranging from 64 to 88%, and clade II contains 17 homologs from 13 species with levels of sequence identity to At5g02890 ranging from 36 to 48% (Figure S2 and Table S2). Interestingly, none of the proteins have been described in detail, indicating that At5g02890 encodes a protein of unknown function.. . . Expression patterns of At5g02890 in Arabidopsis. We evaluated the spatial and temporal expression patterns of At5g02890 using qRT-PCR analysis. At5g02890 transcripts were detected at high levels in siliques, at moderate levels in seedlings, flowers, buds, and stem tops, and at low levels in cauline leaves and stem bases (Figure 1A). This result is consistent with the expression profiling results obtained from the Arabidopsis eFP Browser (http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi).. . Figure 1. . Expression patterns of At5g02890 in Arabidopsis. (A) Analysis of At5g02890 expression levels in various organs.

The data represent the means  standard deviation (SD) of four biological replicates. (B-H) Spatial expression patterns of At5g02890 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring the At5g02890 promoter fused to the GUS gene.

Red arrows indicate specific staining sites. Blue arrow indicates magnified image. Black arrows indicate seeds during the corresponding periods of siliques.. . . . To further investigate the expression patterns of At5g02890, we fused a 1.5-kb fragment of the At5g02890 promoter to the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and transformed it into Arabidopsis. Consistent with the qRT-PCR results, GUS signals were detected in seeds throughout the entire growth period (GUS signals were visible by eye during early seed growth but only microscopically as the seeds matured). In addition, GUS signals were detected in the abscission zones at the bottoms of siliques as well as in buds, flowers, seedlings, stem tops, trichomes of stem bases, hydathodes of rosette leaves and cauline leaves (Figures 1B-F,H,I). The GUS signal was observed in the epidermis cells of stem tops, but it was not epidermis-specific (Figure 1G). These results indicate that At5g02890 is expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs.. . . Overexpression of At5g02890 and At5g02890 orthologous genes from Brassica napus in Arabidopsis causes glossy stems. To investigate the function of At5g02890, we obtained SALK_064174, SALK_064193, and SALK_064194 T-DNA insertion lines from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (http://www.arabidopsis.org). Unfortunately, the later generations of SALK_064174 and SALK_064194 exhibited a wild-type genotype without any T-DNA insertion. Only the progeny of SALK_064193 were homozygous T-DNA insertion plants, but the insertion site was verified after the stop codon and At5g02890 transcript levels were not reduced compared with wild-type plants (Figures S3A,B). Subsequently, we generated six constructs, including 35S::At5g02890-1(antisense)-intron-At5g02890-1 (sense), 35S::At5g02890-2(antisense)-intron-At5g02890-2(sense), 35S::At5g02890-3(antisense)-intron-At5g02890-3 (sense), At5g02890pro::At5g02890-1(antisense)-intron-At5g02890-1 (sense), At5g02890pro::At5g02890-2 (antisense)-intron- At5g02890-2(sense), and At5g02890pro::At5g02890-3(antisense)-intron-At5g02890-3(sense) (At5g02890-1: 290 bp in the 5 UTR; At5g02890-2: 311 bp in the 3 UTR; At5g02890-3: 327 bp in the coding region), which we used to produce RNA interference lines. Similar to the T-DNA insertion lines, we only obtained five RNA interference plants, none of which showed significantly reduced expression of At5g02890 (Figure S3C). We also amplified the coding sequence of At5g02890 and cloned it into the PBI121S binary vector under the control of the Pro35S promoter. The resulting construct was introduced into Arabidopsis via A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Forty-nine lines overexpressing At5g02890 were obtained, which are referred to as OE-At5g02890 lines. Interestingly, the stems of all OE-At5g02890 plants showed a visibly glossy phenotype (Figure 2A), which is typically associated with wax-deficient mutations and indicates qualitative or quantitative modifications in the production of cuticular wax on the stem surface. Four of the OE-At5g02890 lines, namely OE-7, OE-18, OE-27, and OE-33, were selected randomly for further analysis. To examine the glossy phenotype resulting from At5g02890 overexpression, we investigated At5g02890 transcript levels in inflorescence stems from the OE-At5g02890 lines by semiquantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and qRT-PCR analyses using wild-type plants as a control. The expression level of At5g02890 was improved by 402 times to 554 times in OE-At5g02890 plants than in wild type (Figures 3A,B). These results indicate that the glossy stem phenotype was caused by the overexpression of At5g02890.. . Figure 2. . Phenotypic characterization of OE-At5g02890 and OE-Bn1 plants.

The results are presented as relative transcript abundances. The data represent the means  SD of four biological replicates.

Four homologous genes from B. napus, Bn1, Bn2, Bn3, and Bn4, were also identified and cloned into the PBI121S binary vector under the control of the Pro35S promoter (Figure S4). We transformed Arabidopsis with these constructs, obtaining more than 20 transformants per constructs. Interestingly, only overexpression of Bn1 led to the production of Arabidopsis plants with glossy stems (herein named OE-Bn1; Figure 2A).. . . Defective wax deposition and cuticle structure in OE-At5g02890 and OE-Bn1 inflorescence stems. In general, wax crystals and/or cuticle structure defects result in a glossy phenotype. Therefore, we examined the stem surfaces of the transformants via cryogenic-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Jeffree, 2006). The cryo-SEM analysis revealed that epicuticular wax structure in the OE-At5g02890 and OE-Bn1 plants was significantly impaired, with abnormal, reduced numbers of crystals observed in these lines compared with the heavy deposition of wax crystals on the wild-type stem surface (Figures 2B-E). TEM analysis revealed that the cuticles of OE-At5g02890 and OE-Bn1 stems had clearly altered ultrastructure compared to wild type. Wild-type stem cuticles had a typical type-3 cuticle structure (Jeffree, 1996; L et al., 2009; Figure 2F), whereas OE-At5g02890 and OE-Bn1 stems had disorganized, thinner cuticles (Figures 2G-I). Electron density signals reveal the staining of lipid components by osmium tetroxide (Wu et al., 2011). We observed altered electron density and disorganized cuticle structure in the OE-At5g02890 and OE-Bn1 plants. These changes may have resulted from the alteration of lipid components. In summary, the cryo-SEM and TEM analyses revealed altered cuticle structure and wax crystallization in these lines, which caused the glossy phenotype.. . . Chain lengths distribution of cuticular wax composition is significantly affected in OE-At5g02890 plants. The phenotype of the OE-At5g02890 plants suggests that At5g02890 participates in the formation of wax compounds, which mainly contain VLCFAs and their alkane, aldehyde, alcohol, ketone, and ester derivatives. To confirm this hypothesis, we monitored the cuticular wax load and composition of inflorescence stems of the four overexpressing plant lines (OE-7, OE-18, OE-27, and OE-33) and wild-type plants using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. Surprisingly, the total wax load did not differ between the OE-At5g02890 and wild-type plants (Figure S5). However, further analysis indicated that the chain lengths of many components were significantly altered in the overexpression plants compared with wild type. The levels of wax monomers C28 or shorter, such as C26 aldehyde, C26 primary alcohol, C27 alkane, C28 fatty acid, C28 aldehyde, and C28 primary alcohol, were higher in the overexpression plants than in wild type. By contrast, reductions were observed in the levels of all wax monomers C29 and longer, such as C29 alkane, C29 secondary alcohol, C29 ketone, C30 fatty acid, C30 aldehyde, C30 primary alcohol, and C31 alkane. Additionally, significant increases in the levels of C40, C42, C44, and C46 esters were observed in the overexpression plants (Figure 4; Figure S6A). We compared the seven major components of cuticular wax in the OE-At5g02890 and wild-type lines, finding that the OE-At5g02890 lines had significant reductions in the levels of the alkane, secondary alcohol and ketone fractions of wax (alkane-forming pathway) and significant increases in the levels of the primary alcohol and ester fractions (alcohol-forming pathway; Figure S6B). These results suggest that cuticular wax components are severely affected by the overexpression of At5g02890.. . Figure 4. . (A,B) Wax composition in inflorescence stems of the WT and OE-At5g02890 lines. The values represent the means of four biological replicates  SD (t-test: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). OE-7, OE-18, OE-27, and OE-33 represent different At5g02890-overexpressing lines.. . . . . . At5g02890 localizes to the ER. All of the previously characterized wax biosynthetic enzymes are localized to the ER membrane (Samuels et al., 2008). The above results suggest that At5g02890 probably affects the synthesis of wax precursors. To investigate the subcellular localization of At5g02890, mRFP construct, and Bip:RFP fusion construct were used for cytosol marker and ER marker, respectively. The At5g02890:GFP constructs were transiently co-expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts with the cytosol marker and ER marker via PEG/calcium-mediated transformation. As predicted, GFP and ER marker fluorescence signals overlapped, whereas the GFP and cytosol marker fluorescence signals did not overlap. The GFP signals and chlorophyll autofluorescence also did not overlap (Figure 5). This result indicates that At5g02890 is an ER-localized protein, which is consistent with its possible role in the biosynthesis of wax precursors.. . Figure 5. .

Overexpression of At5g02890 alters cuticular wax composition and causes the glossy phenotype which is visible with the naked eye. First, we want to know which wax-related genes were affected; Second, we want to know whether other metabolic pathways which cause some phenotype invisible to the naked eye were affect. So we compared the transcriptional differences between OE-At5g02890 and wild-type inflorescence stems via RNA-seq using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. To obtain reliable and comprehensive expression profiles, we evaluated six samples with three biological replicates from each experimental line. A total of 78,575,762 clean reads from six samples with an average length of 201 bp were generated. An overview of the read information is shown in Table S3. For each gene, the transcript levels were calculated and subsequently normalized to FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads), which represents gene expression levels. To identify the significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we filtered all of the expressed genes using a t-test with restrictive conditions: p  0.05 and q  0.05. In total, 3945 DEGs were isolated from the OE-At5g02890 and wild-type inflorescence stems. Relative to the wild-type control, the OE-At5g02890 stems contained 1434 upregulated genes (Table S4) and 2511 downregulated genes (Table S5).. We performed gene ontology (GO) analysis to investigate the functions of the 3945 DEGs. All 41 groups could be categorized into three main classifications: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. There were 2446 (62.02%) DEGs in the metabolic process category, 1742 (44.17%) in the binding category, and 3359 (85.17%) in the cell category, which were the major categories in each of the three main classifications mentioned above, respectively. In addition, large proportions of DEGs were assigned to the cellular process, catalytic activity, and organelle categories (Figure S7). These results suggest that At5g02890 overexpression strongly affects metabolic activity in the plant. Furthermore, we assigned the DEGs to reference pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database using KeggArray software. Among the typical pathways, metabolic pathways (283 members) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (155 members) were the most highly represented groups. Interestingly, genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction (74 members) and plant-pathogen interaction (65 members) were enriched. In particular, 12 genes involved in fatty acid metabolism had significantly differential expression, which might be associated with the altered cuticular wax composition in OE-At5g02890 inflorescence stems (Figure S8). The upregulated and downregulated genes participate in diverse pathways, indicating that overexpressing At5g02890 not only affects wax biosynthesis, but it also influences other pathways, such as plant hormone signal transduction and plant-pathogen interaction pathways.. . . The expression of wax-related genes is altered in OE-At5g02890 plants. Cuticular wax formation is a fundamental, complex process in vascular plants that has been well described in the model plant A. thaliana. Therefore, we analyzed genes with identified or putative roles in cuticular wax biosynthesis, export, and regulation. Among the 74 genes, which with bold names have experimental evidences for their functions in previous work. Red arrows indicate the upregulated genes and green arrows indicate the downregulated genes (Table S6). The results show that six upregulated and five downregulated genes are involved in wax biosynthesis, whereas only one downregulated gene is related to wax export, and two upregulated genes participate in regulation of wax biosynthesis. Among the 11 cuticular wax biosynthesis-related genes, nine are involved in VLCFA elongation. Our qRT-PCR analysis of selected wax biosynthesis-related genes confirmed the high reliability of the RNA-seq data. Not surprisingly, the expression patterns revealed by qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq tended to be consistent (Figure 6A). Among these genes involved in C28 fatty acid elongation, the expression levels of CER2 and CER6 were significantly higher in OE-At5g02890 lines; however CER26, CER26-LIKE, and CER60 show the same expression level (Figure 6B).. .

FPKM, Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads. WT and OE represent wild-type lines and At5g02890-overexpression lines, respectively.. . . . . . Overexpression of At5g02890 affects phytohormone homeostasis in inflorescence stems. Changes in the expression levels of groups of genes implicated in various phytohormone signal transduction pathways were identified in OE-At5g02890 inflorescence stems (Table S7). Genes involved in auxin metabolism and signaling constituted the largest group, and those involved in abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were also significantly affected. We investigated identified or putative genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and transport. Auxin biosynthesis genes, such as anthranilate synthase genes (ASA1, ASB1), Cytochrome P450 genes (CYP79B2, CYP79B3), and SUPERROOT2 (SUR2), showed much lower expression levels in OE-At5g02890 plants than in wild type. However, the nitrilase gene NIT2 and TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA1) showed enhanced transcription in OE-At5g02890 plants compared to wild type. In addition, several auxin transport and signaling translation genes were differentially expressed, showing complex expression profiles (Table S8). Similarly, we confirmed the high reliability of the RNA-seq data using qRT-PCR analysis of selected auxin metabolism-related genes (Figure 6A).. Many genes related to phytohormones have different expression levels in OE-At5g02890 plants, indicating that the phytohormone homeostasis maybe affected. So we measured the concentrations of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), ABA, JA, and jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) by HPLC-MS. Obvious differences were found in the concentrations of these endogenous phytohormones between wild-type and OE-At5g02890 plants in stem tops and stem bases. The contents of endogenous ABA, JA, and JA-Ile were significantly lower in OE-At5g02890 stem tops and stem bases compared to wild type. Interestingly, the IAA content was increased by ~45% in OE-At5g02890 stem tops and reduced by ~47% in OE-At5g02890 stem bases compared to wild type (Figure 7). These results suggest that overexpressing At5g02890 may influence ABA, JA, and JA-Ile biosynthesis and block polar auxin transport.. . Figure 7. . Detection of endogenous phytohormone contents. The endogenous IAA, ABA, JA, and JA-Ile contents in WT and OE plants were detected. The data are presented as the means  SE from six biologically independent experiments (t-test: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). WT and OE represent wild-type lines and At5g02890-overexpressing lines, respectively..
PMC4122942	Results. . A Large Number of Imprinted Genes Were Formed by Duplication During the Evolution of the Brassicales. To evaluate the duplication history of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis, we analyzed imprinted genes identified by two studies that used Illumina transcriptome sequencing in polymorphic F1 seeds of A. thaliana (Hsieh et al. 2011; Wolff et al. 2011). A total of 126 imprinted genes were identified by Hsieh et al. (2011), including 116 maternally expressed genes (megs) and 10 paternally expressed genes (pegs), and 65 imprinted genes were identified in Wolff et al. (2011) including 39 megs and 26 pegs. Together the two studies identified 183 imprinted and putatively imprinted genes including 149 megs and 34 pegs. We analyzed the set of imprinted genes in a phylogenetic context to identify those that arose by gene duplication during the evolution of the Brassicales (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). We found that 125 out of the 183 imprinted genes (68%) originated from gene duplication events in the Brassicaceae lineage after it diverged from the Caricaceae lineage within the Brassicales (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). Among the 125 imprinted genes, 54 genes were derived from the alpha WGD (gene pairs identified by Blanc et al. [2003] and Bowers et al. [2003]; gene pairs shown in supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online), which are specific to the Brassicaceae family, and 44 genes by tandem duplication. Other kinds of gene duplication events also have contributed to the formation of the imprinted genes. Most of the paralogs of those imprinted genes are not reported as imprinted (Hsieh et al. 2011; Wolff et al. 2011), suggesting many imprinted genes might be specific to the Brassicaceae lineage, and that the acquisition of imprinting happened after those gene duplication events. However, neither Hsieh et al. (2011) nor Wolff et al. (2011) exhaustively identified imprinted genes in A. thaliana, and thus, it is possible that some of the paralogs of the imprinted genes, which were not identified as imprinted, are actually imprinted too.. . . Asymmetric Sequence Evolution Is Common in Duplicated Pairs with Imprinted Genes. Duplicated genes sometimes show asymmetric sequence rate evolution, such that the amino acid sequence of one copy has evolved faster than the other copy. That phenomenon has been associated with functional diversification and neofunctionalization (Dermitzakis and Clark 2001; Blanc and Wolfe 2004; Kim and Yi 2006; Byrne and Wolfe 2007; Liu and Adams 2010). To test the hypothesis that duplicated genes with imprinting frequently show asymmetric sequence rate evolution compared with their paralogs, we used 46 alpha WGD gene pairs where one gene in the pair shows imprinting (Hsieh et al. 2011; Wolff et al. 2011). Gene pairs from the alpha WGD were used in this analysis because they were simultaneously duplicated and thus the results could be compared regardless of the age of the duplication. We used the method of Blanc and Wolfe (2004), which included an amino acid substitution rate analysis of the paralogs in Arabidopsis compared with an outgroup, to analyze sequence rate evolution in the pair after their formation by duplication.. Of the imprinted genes identified by Hsieh et al. (2011), 15 out of 35 (43%) pairs of alpha WG duplicated genes show asymmetric protein sequence evolution, and within the 15 pairs, there are nine pairs (60%) where the imprinted genes evolved faster (fig. 1 and supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). In contrast, of the imprinted genes from Wolff et al. (2011), 8 out of 11 (73%) of alpha WG duplicated pairs have asymmetric protein sequence evolution, and 7 (88%) of those evolved faster than their paralogs (fig. 1 and supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). Thus, the imprinted genes often showed a faster rate of sequence evolution than their duplicated partners, especially among the genes identified in Wolff et al. (2011). They only analyzed genes with endosperm-specific expression in the seeds with the exclusion of genes having a broader expression pattern in seeds, suggesting that endosperm-specific imprinted genes more often showed a higher rate of sequence evolution than their duplicated partners. In contrast, Hsieh et al. (2011) applied microdissection to purify endosperm and then analyzed the endosperm transcriptome to find evidence for allelic biased expression and imprinting. Considering that the two research groups used different methodologies for identifying imprinted genes, we did not mix them and instead made them two sets of genes. AT1G17770 was identified as imprinted by both studies, and thus it is present in both data sets. Of the 15 imprinted genes that we found to evolve faster than their paralogs, eight have been shown to have functions, indicating that they are not pseudogenes, whereas the other seven have not been characterized. Those eight imprinted genes with known functions (in some cases, in other organ types and not the endosperm) include the histone H3K4 demethylase JMJ15 (Yang et al. 2012), CINV1 which plays roles in sugar metabolism and antioxidant defense (Xiang et al. 2011), G6PD5 which is involved in oxidative stress responses (Wakao et al. 2008), TAR1 which is involved in embryo patterning (Stepanova et al. 2008), VEL2 which plays a role in repression of FLC gene family members during vernalization (Kim and Sung 2013), PKR2 which is involved in activation of polycomb group target genes (Aichinger et al. 2009), FWA whose expression causes a late flowering phenotype (Kinoshita et al. 2004), and HDG3 which functions in anther dehiscence (Li et al. 2007).. Fig. 1.-Asymmetric sequence rate evolution in duplicated gene pairs with imprinted genes. Pie charts indicating the number and percentage of asymmetrically evolving gene pairs (dark blue), the number and percentage of asymmetrically evolving gene pairs where the imprinted gene show faster sequence evolution than the paralog (light blue), and the number and percentage of symmetrically evolving gene pairs (gray). (a) Gene pairs with imprinted genes identified in Wolff et al. (2011). (b) Gene pairs with imprinted genes identified in Hsieh et al. (2011).. Blanc and Wolfe (2004) analyzed 833 duplicated gene pairs from the alpha WGD, using the same method to what we used, and found that 21% of them have evolved in an asymmetric pattern. That compares to 43% of the genes, we analyzed from Hsieh et al. (2011) and 73% of the genes we analyzed from Wolff et al. (2011). A chi2 test showed that the number of genes showing asymmetric rate evolution among the alpha WG duplicates with imprinted genes from Hsieh et al. (2011) and Wolff et al. (2011) is significantly different from the set of 833 alpha WGD genes analyzed by Blanc and Wolfe (2004) (chi2, P = 9.876e-4 and 7.266e-4). Thus, imprinted genes and their paralogs have a higher frequency of accelerated sequence evolution than gene pairs as a whole that were duplicated by the alpha WGD. In addition, among 267 alpha WGD pairs analyzed in Liu et al. (2011), only 16% showed an asymmetric sequence evolution pattern.. . . Many Imprinted Genes Have Restricted Expression Patterns and Preferential Expression in Reproductive Organs. Duplicated gene pairs sometimes have contrasting expression patterns, such that one gene is broadly expressed in a wide range of organ and tissue types, whereas the other gene shows an expression pattern that is restricted to only a small number of organ types. We next tested the hypothesis that duplicated imprinted genes show a restricted expression pattern compared with their paralogs. We analyzed Arabidopsis ATH1 microarray data from 63 different organ types and developmental stages (Schmid et al. 2005). We used microarray data because data are available from a large number of organ types and developmental stages. Although imprinting is only found in seeds, imprinted genes are not necessarily only expressed in seeds. Many imprinted genes identified by Hsieh et al. (2011) and Wolff et al. (2011) have expression in vegetative and floral organ types as well. Thus, for both imprinted genes and their paralogs, we calculated the expression width, defined as how many organ types and developmental stages in which a gene has significant expression levels, and expression organ specificity, which indicates whether a gene has preferential expression in few organ types and developmental stages or broad expression in most organ types and developmental stages. We analyzed all gene pairs with imprinted genes that arose from the alpha WGD that were analyzed in the rate analyses in the previous section if microarray data were available for both copies. In some cases, microarray data were not available for one or both copies.. For imprinted genes from Hsieh et al. (2011), 11 out of 24 (46%) of the imprinted genes have a smaller width compared with their paralogs, which means that they are expressed in fewer organ types than their paralogs (fig. 2 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online). Calculating the expression specificity in different organ types, 13 out of 24 imprinted genes (54%) have higher expression organ specificity than the paralogs; nine pairs overlapped in the two analyses. A similar trend is more apparent with imprinted genes from Wolff et al. (2011): Six out of nine imprinted genes have limited expression, and six out of nine imprinted genes have higher organ specificity of expression (fig. 2 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online). The imprinted genes with limited expression patterns also have higher expression levels in reproductive organs. Overall, the reproductive organ-specific expression is a relatively common feature of imprinted genes, which contrasts to the broadly expressed paralogs.. Fig. 2.-Many imprinted genes have a more restricted expression pattern compared with their paralogs. (a) Expression width, based on microarray data. Dark blue: Number and percentage of imprinted genes with a smaller expression width. Gray: Number and percentage of imprinted genes with a larger expression width. (b) Organ specificity of expression, based on microarray data. Dark blue: Number and percentage of imprinted genes with a higher organ specificity of expression. Gray: Imprinted genes with a lower organ specificity of expression. In panels (a) and (b), gene pairs with imprinted genes identified in Wolff et al. (2011) are on the left, and gene pairs with imprinted genes identified in Hsieh et al. (2011) are on the right.. When comparing the results from the expression analysis and asymmetric sequence rate analysis, we observed that many imprinted genes that evolved faster than the paralogs also show a restricted expression pattern. In Hsieh et al. (2011), nine imprinted genes evolved faster than their paralogs, and five of them have at least one index indicating restricted expression, whereas there is no expression data for two imprinted genes. In Wolff et al. (2011), seven imprinted genes evolved faster than their paralogs, and five of them have at least one index indicating restricted expression, whereas two imprinted genes have no data. In total, 15 imprinted genes (AT1G17770 identified by both studies) evolved faster than their paralogs, ten of them have a restricted expression profile, two do not, and expression data are not available for three others.. . . Expression Patterns of Imprinted Genes Changed after Gene Duplication to Become Restricted to Reproductive Organs. We tested the hypothesis that the imprinted genes with reproductive organ-restricted expression might result from the loss of expression in vegetative organs by investigating the expression pattern of orthologs from Carica and Vitis to infer the preduplication ancestral expression pattern. We examined six duplicated pairs, which have imprinted genes with reproductive organ restricted expression patterns and paralogous partners with broad or nonreproductive organ restricted expression patterns.. Five of the six imprinted genes are only expressed in flowers and/or siliques of Arabidopsis (fig. 3): The maternally expressed genes JMJ15 (AT2G34880, a histone demethylase) and VEL2 (AT2G18880, vernalization-related protein 5), along with the paternally expressed genes TAR1 (AT1G23320, tryptophan aminotransferase-related protein), PKR2 (AT4G31900, pickle related-protein 2), and AT3G50720 (a protein kinase). In contrast, the alpha WGD paralogs all have broad expression in both vegetative and reproductive organs (fig. 3). The Carica and Vitis orthologs of each of the six gene pairs from Arabidopsis are broadly expressed (fig. 3), indicating that the preduplication expression pattern is likely to be a broad expression pattern. Thus, the imprinted genes in Arabidopsis likely lost expression in vegetative organs. This is consistent with the genes becoming specialized in reproductive organs.. Fig. 3.-RT-PCR results of imprinted genes, their paralogs, and orthologs from outgroup species. RT-PCR expression assays were performed using five organ types: Root, stem, leaf, flower, and silique (Arabidopsis)/seed (Carica and Vitis), listed above the corresponding columns. Plus signs indicate the presence of reverse transcriptase in the reaction, and minus signs indicate the absence of reverse transcriptase as negative controls. Gene pairs in Arabidopsis thaliana (At), and their orthologs from outgroup species, Carica papaya (Cp), and Vitis vinifera (Vv) are listed beside the corresponding panels. ACTIN in each species was used as a positive control for RT-PCR, and the results are shown in the bottom right graph.. . . Expression, Sequence, and Structural Evolution of MPC, FWA, and HDG3. We studied sequence evolution and expression patterns of three imprinted genes in more detail. MPC, FWA (or HDG6), and HDG3 were among the initial imprinted genes to be discovered in A. thaliana before the high-throughput sequencing studies in 2011. All three genes were derived from the Brassicaceae-specific alpha WGD (Blanc et al. 2003; Bowers et al. 2003; supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). The PAB8 paralog of MPC encodes a poly(A) binding protein that plays a role in mRNA stability and translation, whereas maternally expressed MPC encodes a truncated protein that only has one-fourth the length of regular PAB proteins at the C-terminal domain (Tiwari et al. 2008). FWA has maternal expression in the female gametophyte and silique (Nakamura et al. 2006), and its ectopic expression in vegetative tissue causes a late flowering phenotype (Kinoshita et al. 2004); in contrast, its paralog HDG7 functions in vegetative meristems (Nakamura et al. 2006). HDG3 is a paternally expressed gene (Gehring et al. 2009) that may function in the regulation of anther dehiscence (Li et al. 2007). The function of its paralog HDG2 is related to epidermal development such as trichome and stoma differentiation (Marks et al. 2009; Peterson et al. 2013), as well as for the identity of petals and stamens (Kamata et al. 2013).. MPC and HDG3 have expression only in siliques (fig. 4), whereas their paralogs PAB8 and HDG2 are broadly expressed. To test the hypothesis that the expression of the imprinted genes became more restricted after gene duplication, we reconstructed its ancestral expression profile by assaying the expression pattern of orthologs in Carica and Vitis. The MPC/PAB8 and HDG3/HDG2 orthologs in Carica and Vitis were both broadly expressed. That suggested that the ancestral expression state was broad expression, and that MPC and HDG3 acquired a silique-specific expression pattern after duplication. FWA is expressed in flowers and seeds (fig. 4a). In contrast, HDG7 is expressed only in young vegetative tissues, such as root and stem tips (Nakamura et al. 2006), and probably because of its low expression level in limited tissue types, the expression was not detected by RT-PCR (fig. 4a). The FWA/HDG7 orthologs in Carica and Vitis had a similar expression pattern to HDG7 (fig. 4a) suggesting that HDG7 has the ancestral state of expression and the expression pattern of FWA in siliques was derived after gene duplication.. Fig. 4.-Analyses of MPC, FWA, and HDG3. (a) RT-PCR expression assays were performed using five organ types: Root, stem, leaf, flower, and silique (Arabidopsis)/seed (Carica and Vitis), listed above the corresponding columns. Plus signs indicate the presence of reverse transcriptase in the reaction, and minus signs indicate the absence of reverse transcriptase as negative controls gDNA, genomic DNA. Gene pairs in Arabidopsis thaliana (At), and their orthologs of MPC/PAB8, FWA/HDG7, and HDG3/HDG2 from outgroup species, Carica papaya (Cp) and Vitis vinifera (Vv) are listed beside the corresponding panels. (b) Sequence rate analyses. Phylogenetic trees of each gene have sequences from A. thaliana (At), C. papaya (Cp), Populus trichocarpa (Pt), Ricinus communis (Rc), Manihot esculenta (Me), and V. vinifera (Vv). Trees are unrooted. Branch lengths were generated by Codeml in PAML, and the scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per codon. Branch-wise Ka/Ks ratios are indicated above the branches. Imprinted genes and their larger Ka/Ks ratios are shown in bold. Circles indicate the gene duplication events that gave rise to the imprinted genes and their paralogs. (c) Site-specific selection analysis on FWA HD-ZIP domain to detect positively selected amino acid sites. An amino acid alignment of the HD-ZIP domain in FWA and HDG7 in A. thaliana (At), and orthologous genes from C. papaya (Cp), P. trichocarpa (Pt), R. communis (Rc), M. esculenta (Me), and V. vinifera (Vv) showing the amino acid substitution in FWA. Residues with more than 50% shared identity are black shaded, and similar amino acids are gray shaded. Motifs are labeled under the bar below the alignment. Stars indicate potential DNA sequence-specific contact residues that are conserved in all AtHDG family members but FWA. Positively selected sites on FWA were marked by triangles, where black triangles indicate posterior probabilities (PP) greater than 0.99 and gray triangles indicate PPs greater than 0.95.. We further characterized sequence rate evolution in MPC and PAB8, FWA and HDG7, and HDG3 and HDG2 using a free-ratio analysis in PAML to calculate the Ka/Ks ratio of imprinted genes and their paralogs. We found that MPC, FWA, and HDG3 all experienced accelerated sequence rate evolution (i.e., higher Ka/Ks ratio) compared with their paralogs (fig. 4b). The Ka/Ks ratio of MPC is approximately twice that of PAB8, and the Ka/Ks ratio of FWA is approximately three times that of HDG7. HDG3 has a Ka/Ks ratio approximately seven times that of HDG2. Branch site-specific positive selection analysis indicated that the HD-ZIP domain of FWA has several amino acid sites that show evidence for positive selection (fig. 4c). It is noteworthy that of four potential DNA sequence-specific contact residues of Arabidopsis HDG proteins that are conserved across the HDG proteins (Nakamura et al. 2006), two of them are not conserved in FWA and those sites show positive selection (fig. 4c). Together, the detection of positive selection and the evolution of a new expression profile in FWA suggest neofunctionalization of FWA.. . . Oppositely Imprinted Gene Duplicates with Rapid Sequence Evolution. Two paralogous gene pairs that are both imprinted have imprinting on opposite alleles. They are HDG9 and HDG10 that are members of the HD-ZIP IV gene family, along with SUVH7 and SUVH8 that encode SET domain proteins. Described as imprinted by Gehring et al. (2009), HDG9 is a meg with exclusively maternal expression, and its alpha WG duplicate, HDG8 is a primarily maternally expressed gene. In contrast, HDG10, which was derived from HDG9, was identified by Wolff et al. (2011) as a peg. A second case is SU(VAR)3-9 HOMOLOG 7 (SUVH7) which is a peg, and SUVH8 which is a meg, both of which were identified in Hsieh et al. (2011). They have an alpha WG duplicate SUVH3, as well as another duplicate SUVH1 both of which to appear to be nonimprinted (Hsieh et al. 2011). We characterized the sequence rate evolution of these imprinted duplicated gene pairs in comparison with their paralogs (fig. 5). We found that both HDG9 and HDG10 evolved significantly faster than HDG8 and most orthologs from outgroup species. We found the Ka/Ks ratios of HDG9 and HDG10 are approximately 2.5 and 3.5 times higher than HDG8. HDG10 evolved slightly faster than HDG9, but the difference is not statistically significant. Similarly, both SUVH7 and SUVH8 have a higher Ka/Ks ratio than SUVH3 or SUVH1, indicating relaxation of purifying selection on the two imprinted genes. Considering that the branch leading to the HDG9/HDG10 has a significantly higher Ka/Ks ratio than HDG8 and the preorthologous branch, we could infer that the ancestral gene of HDG9/HDG10 was already evolving more rapidly than HDG8 (fig. 5). However, this is not seen for the most recent common ancestral gene of SUVH7/SUVH8, which shows a Ka/Ks ratio similar to SUVH3 and significantly lower than either of its descendants, SUVH7 and SUVH8, indicating SUVH7 and SUVH8 started to accelerate in sequence evolution independently after diverging from each other (fig. 5). One possible explanation might be that the precursor of HDG9/HDG10 was also a meg just like HDG8 and evolved at a rapid rate. For SUVH7 and SUVH8, their precursor was likely to be a nonimprinted gene as is SUVH3. Then, they were recruited into genomic imprinting independently after their split, along with both sequences evolving rapidly.. Fig. 5.-Sequence rate analyses of HDG9/HDG10 and SUVH7/SUVH8. Phylogenetic trees of each gene have sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana (At), Carica papaya (Cp), Populus trichocarpa (Pt), Ricinus communis (Rc), Manihot esculenta (Me), and Vitis vinifera (Vv).

Imprinted genes are shown in bold. The suffix of Arabidopsis genes indicates the imprinting status: meg versus peg. High Ka/Ks ratios of imprinted genes or their inferred precursor are shown also in bold. Circles indicate the gene duplication events that gave rise to the imprinted genes and their paralogs..
PMC4862123	Results. A pyruvate transporter TaBASS2 was isolated from salt-tolerant wheat cultivar Shanrong 3. The expression of TaBASS2 was induced by NaCl stress as well as H2O2 and ABA treatments. Constitutive expression of TaBASS2 in Arabidopsis bass2-1 mutant complemented the mevastatin-sensitive phenotype that reflects the deficiency of transporting pyruvic acid into chloroplast. Overexpression of TaBASS2 enhanced salinity tolerance and reactive oxygen species scavenging in wheat. Arabidopsis constitutively expressing TaBASS2 also exhibited enhanced tolerance to salinity and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis, TaBASS2 repressed the expression of ABA INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4), a node linking ABA signaling and plastid retrograde signaling pathways. However, the enhanced salinity tolerance of TaBASS2 overexpression Arabidopsis was abolished when ABI4 expression was restored to the level of wild-type through overexpressing ABI4..
PMC4411111	Results. . GFP-TIP2;1 labels excess bulbs in regulator of bulb biogenesis1. We recently carried out a screen for mutants in tonoplast protein trafficking and vacuole biogenesis and characterized the function of the VTI11 SNARE protein and phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion [28]. During the course of this work, we identified a mutant in which the tonoplast protein GFP-TIP2;1 labeled many vacuolar bulbs and it was named regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 (rbb1-1). In the parental line, the GFP-TIP2;1 protein labels the tonoplast and very few bulbs in root epidermis and cortex and the epidermis of hypocotyls, cotyledons and rosette leaves (Fig 1A-1D) [16, 28, 36]. In the rbb1-1 mutant, GFP-TIP2;1 also labels the tonoplast, and the size and morphology of the vacuole appeared normal. However, many more bulbs were evident as bright sub-vacuolar structures in multiple tissues (Fig 1E-1H). In hypocotyls, bulbs were observed consistently in many cells in the epidermis and cortex (Fig 1E). Bulbs were also apparent in high numbers in the epidermis of cotyledons and rosette leaves of rbb1-1 (Fig 1F and 1H). Vacuolar bulbs were detected in roots (Fig 1G), but this phenotype was variable amongst different seed stocks and was not characterized further. The variability in the root phenotype may be due to root-specific modifying factors that segregate in the population. No major defects in plant morphology were detected in rbb1-1 homozygous plants (S1 Fig). Sequencing demonstrated that the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene is intact in rbb1-1 and consequently, the bulb phenotype is not related to a mutation in the GFP-TIP2;1 protein sequence.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125621.g001. Fig 1. . regulator of bulb biogenesis1 contains many bulbs in many cell types.. (a-h) rbb1-1 mutants have more bulbs than the parental line. GFP-TIP2;1 localization in the parental line (WT, a-d) or rbb1-1 (e-h). Four-day-old seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize morphology of the vacuole in the epidermis of hypocotyl (a, e) and cotyledon (b, f), and in root epidermis and cortex (c, g). The bulb phenotype was also observed in rosette leaves of 6-week-old plants (d, h). Scale bar = 20 mum. (i-n) GFP-TIP2;1 and RFP-TIP1;1 co-localize in rbb1-1 bulbs. The hypocotyls of 4-day-old dark-grown seedlings expressing GFP-TIP2;1 (green, i, l) and RFP-TIP1;1 (magenta, j, m) in the parental line (i-k) and rbb1-1 mutants (l-n) are shown. Merged images (k, n) are also shown. Scale bar: 20 mum. (o) rbb1-1 mutants do not accumulate higher levels of GFP-TIP2;1 in seedlings. Immunoblot of GFP-TIP2;1 accumulation in the parental line and rbb1-1 using antibodies against GFP (alpha-GFP) and Calreticulin (alpha-CRT) as loading control.. . . . TIP1;1-YFP is often found in vacuolar bulbs [16, 23, 37]. In order to determine if the rbb1-1 bulbs accumulate TIP1;1 in a similar manner, we introduced a RFP-TIP1;1 fusion in the rbb1-1 mutant background. In the parental line, RFP-TIP1;1 localized to the tonoplast, and labeled very few bulbs in roots and hypocotyls (Fig 1I-1K). RFP-TIP1;1 co-localized with GFP-TIP2;1 in the tonoplast and the bulbs when the two markers were co-expressed in rbb1-1 (Fig 1L-1N). It was previously proposed that vacuolar bulbs are involved in the degradation of membrane proteins [19] and that bulbs may form as a response to overexpression of dimer-type FP [24]. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 could be caused by enhanced accumulation of GFP-TIP2;1 in rbb1-1 by Western blot. No significant differences in GFP-TIP2;1 protein accumulation were detected between rbb1-1 and the parental control, indicating that the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 is not related to differences in protein accumulation or stability (Fig 1O and S1C Fig). These results overall indicate that, independent on the nature of the bulbs in rbb1-1, the RBB1 locus is required to prevent the formation or accumulation of bulbs in the vacuole.. In order to compare rbb1-1 bulbs with the IVSPs and bulbs previously described [24], we measured the maximum intensity values for bulb membranes in rbb1-1. As shown in S2 Fig, maximum intensity values for the bulbs in the parental line are 1.2- and 1.3-fold higher than the outer tonoplast in cotyledons and hypocotyls, respectively. In contrast, rbb1-1 bulbs have 2 fold higher intensity than the tonoplast in hypocotyl, and 3.5-fold higher in cotyledons. Therefore, rbb1-1 bulbs would fit the description of both IVSPs and bulbs [24]. Moreover, given the fact that the GFP-TIP2;1 protein levels in rbb1-1 mutants is similar to the parental line, we conclude that the rbb1-1 bulbs are not simply the result of increased GFP dimerization in the mutant. However, we can not discard the possibility that GFP dimerization acts as an enhancer of the rbb1 phenotype. Given the complexity of these structures, we will refer to them here simply as bulbs.. The vacuole membrane in many plant species constantly remodels with the formation of transvacuolar strands (TVS). We then hypothesized that the mechanisms involved in bulb formation and the dynamics of TVS may be related and that RBB1 may have a role in TVS formation. In order to test this possibility, we compared the number of TVS between the parental line and rbb1-1 mutants. In contrast to the parental line, which shows 4.06  0.39 TVS per cell in cotyledon epidermis, rbb1-1 mutants have only 1.40  0.16 (Fig 2A and S3A and S3B Fig). Therefore, rbb1-1 has ~3-fold fewer TVS than the parental line, and this result provides support to a hypothesis that RBB1 is involved in TVS formation. This phenotype was also observed in the hypocotyls of light- and dark-grown seedlings. Thus, the parental line showed an average of 2.2  0.2 TVS per cell in the light and 1.75  0.21 in the dark, while the rbb1-1 mutant had 1.25  0.15 and 1.03  0.19, respectively (Fig 2B). This indicates that rbb1-1 had a 40% reduction in the number of TVS per cell in hypocotyls in both light and dark-grown seedlings. These results point towards important roles of RBB1 in the remodeling of the vacuole that generates either bulbs or TVS.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125621.g002. Fig 2. . rbb1-1 mutants have fewer transvacuolar strands.. (a) The number of trans-vacuolar strands (TVS) per cell was counted in cotyledon cells from the parental line and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown in the light. n = 48 cells from 8 seedlings. (b) rbb1-1 mutants have fewer TVS in hypocotyl from light- and dark-grown seedlings. Seedlings were germinated in the light or dark for 4 days and TVS were counted. n = 60 cells from 10 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. * Significantly different to the parental line in a t-test (P  0.05).. . . . . . The rbb1-1 phenotype can be detected 3 days post-germination. In order to characterize the developmental progression of the bulb phenotype in rbb1-1, vacuoles were visualized at different times during seed germination (Fig 3A-3J). No bulbs were observed in PSVs of imbibed seeds or 1 d after incubation at 22C in either the parental line or rbb1-1 (Fig 3A, 3B, 3F and 3G). Bulbs were first detected at day 2 post-germination in both the parental line and rbb1-1 when the large lytic vacuole is already established [16]. The bulbs were very transient in the parental line and very few were observed at 3 days or later. In contrast, the number of bulbs in rbb1-1 continued to increase at days 3 and 4. These results indicate that RBB1 function may be important after day 3, but not during the early stages of germination.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125621.g003. Fig 3. . Developmental progression of the rbb1-1 phenotype and effects from light.. (a-j) The bulb phenotype is apparent in hypocotyls after 3 d of germination. Germinating seedlings from the parental line (GFP-TIP2;1, a-e) and rbb1-1 mutants (f-j) were imaged after 0-4 days of incubation. (k-n) The bulb phenotype of rbb1-1 is present in light- and dark-grown seedlings. GFP-TIP2;1 localization in hypocotyls was visualized in 4-d-old seedlings from the parental line (WT, k, m) or rbb1-1 (l, n) when grown under light (k, l) or dark (m, n) conditions. n = 36 cells from 6 seedlings. All scale bars = 20 mum. (o) Dark treatment does not alter the rbb1-1 phenotype. The number of bulbs was counted in hypocotyls from parental line and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown in the light or in the dark as in k-n. n = 9-15 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. (p) rbb1-1 hypocotyls have fewer TVS after 3 d of germination. Seedlings were germinated in the light and TVS were counted after 2 days of incubation. n = 50 cells from 5 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. * Significantly different to the parental line in a t-test (P  0.01).. . . . One proposed function of the bulbs is to contribute membranes during cell expansion [15]. This prompted us to investigate whether the rbb1-1 phenotype was affected by conditions that promoted cell expansion such as the elongation of hypocotyls in the dark. To this end, vacuoles from the hypocotyl epidermis of parental and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown either in the light or the dark were imaged in the microscope, and bulbs were counted. While the parental control seedlings grown in the light contain 0.10  0.03 bulbs per 103 mum2 (Fig 3K and 3O), the rbb1-1 mutant contains 1.00  0.16 (Fig 3L and 3O). Therefore, the rbb1-1 mutant contains 10 fold more bulbs per area in hypocotyls when compared to the parental control grown under normal light conditions. Next we analyzed the phenotype of rbb1-1 mutants in the dark. In contrast to the dark-grown parental control, which contains 0.07  0.01 bulbs per 103 mum2 (Fig 3M and 3O), the dark-grown rbb1-1 mutant showed 1.18  0.09 bulbs per 103 mum2 (Fig 3N and 3O), or a 16-fold increase. Thus, the number of bulbs in rbb1-1 was higher than the parental under both light treatments, but light availability did not significantly alter the rbb1-1 phenotype. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs would enhance the elongation rate of dark-grown rbb1-1 seedlings, but no differences in hypocotyl length were detected between the mutant and the parental control at 3 or 5 d (S3C Fig). Furthermore, cell elongation was not affected, as we could not detect significant differences in cell size between the wild type and rbb1-1 hypocotyls when grown in the dark (S3D Fig).. Finally, if the RBB1 is responsible for the bulb and TVS phenotypes of rbb1-1, we expected a similar developmental progression, which can be tested by quantification of TVS during germination. TVS could not clearly be detected before day 2, and no significant difference was detected at day 2 between wild type and rbb1-1 hypocotyls when grown in the light (Fig 3P) However, the number of TVS was reduced by 28% in rbb1-1 when compared to the wild type. This reduction was even greater (41%) at day 4. Therefore, the appearance of the bulb phenotype at days 3 and 4 correlates well with the reduction of TVS numbers in rbb1-1.. . . GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking to the vacuole is not altered in rbb1-1. The increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 could be the result of abnormal GFP-TIP2;1 protein trafficking to the vacuole. To test this hypothesis, two inhibitors for tonoplast protein trafficking were used. Brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits a Golgi-dependent pathway for tonoplast proteins in hypocotyls and C834 inhibits a Golgi-independent traffic of GFP-TIP2;1 to the tonoplast [29]. We treated the GFP-TIP2;1 (parental control), the TIP1;1-YFP line and the rbb1-1 mutant with BFA and visualized each fusion protein in hypocotyls. The fusion proteins localized to the tonoplast (GFP-TIP2;1) or tonoplast and bulbs (rbb1-1 and TIP1;1-YFP) in the DMSO control as expected (Fig 4A-4C). In BFA-treated cells, the GFP-TIP2;1 localization was unchanged in the parental control (Fig 4D) or rbb1-1 (Fig 4E), indicating that the trafficking of this protein was still BFA-insensitive. In contrast and consistent with previous reports [29], the TIP1;1-YFP marker line displayed large and bright aggregates in the presence of BFA (Fig 4F). Next we tested sensitivity to C834. GFP-TIP2;1 localized to the tonoplast and did not co-localize with the ER marker mCherry-HDEL in neither the parental line or rbb1-1 (Fig 4G-4I and 4M-4O). In contrast, GFP-TIP2;1 co-localized with the ER marker in C834-treated roots of the parental line (Fig 4J-4L) and rbb1-1 (Fig 4P-4R). Therefore, we conclude that GFP-TIP2;1 traffics in a similar pathway in rbb1-1 and the parental line, at least early in the secretory pathway, and that the bulb-localization of GFP-TIP2;1 in rbb1-1 does not appear to be the result of altered trafficking to the vacuole.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125621.g004. Fig 4. . GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking to the vacuole is similar between rbb1-1 and the parental line.. (a-f) BFA inhibits trafficking of TIP1;1YFP but not GFP-TIP2;1 in the parental line or rbb1-1. Four-day-old seedlings from the parental (GFP-TIP2;1, a, d), rbb1-1 (b, e) or TIP1;1-YFP (c, f) were exposed to 0.1% DMSO (control, a, b, c) or 75 muM BFA (d, e, f) for 3 hours and hypocotyl cells were imaged. BFA compartments are indicated with arrows. Scale: 20 mum. (g-r) C834 inhibits GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking in the parental line and rbb1-1. Three-day-old seedlings from the parental line and rbb1-1 were exposed to 0.5% DMSO (g-i, m-o) or 55 muM C834 (j-l, p-r) for 48 h, and root cells were imaged in the microscope. Signal from GFP-TIP2;1 (green, g, j, m, p), the ER marker mCherry-HDEL (magenta, h, k, n, p) or the merged image is shown (i, l, o, r). Co-localization of GFP with mCherry-HDEL at the ER is indicated with arrowheads. Scale bar: 20 mum.. . . . . . The RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450. The bulb phenotype of rbb1-1 segregated as 25 out of 96 (1/3.84) in a backcross to the GFP-TIP2;1 parental line, suggesting that the rbb1-1 mutation is recessive. In order to identify the RBB1 locus, we used a combination of map-based cloning and whole genome sequencing. The RBB1 gene mapped to a region of 2.2Mb in Chromosome 5 between markers RBCS-B and PINHEAD. Using Illumina whole-genome sequencing, we identified nucleotide variants in the rbb1-1 mutant genome between these two markers. From those, only two SNPs located within gene coding sequences and corresponding to EMS-type non-silent mutations were detected, in At5g38540 and At5g40450. In order to determine which gene corresponded to the RBB1 locus, we identified Salk T-DNA insertion alleles [38] for both candidate genes. Only one T-DNA line, SALK_095160, for At5g38540 was available, but no homozygote plants could be recovered. Heterozygous plants were crossed to rbb1-1 and the vacuole phenotype of F1 seedlings grown in the dark was analyzed. Out of 27 F1 seedlings, none showed the rbb1-1 bulb phenotype indicating that RBB1 was unlikely to correspond to At5g38540. We obtained two SALK T-DNA alleles for At5g40450 (Fig 5A). However, one of the T-DNA lines, SALK_067590, had a complex transgene insertion and could not be used. We used RT-PCR to determine if At5g40450 was expressed in SALK_074387. The expression of the full length At5g40450 was disrupted in SALK_074387 (Fig 5B), and therefore, this was a good mutant allele to test for the bulb phenotype. However, it is unclear if this allele is a complete loss of function allele because partial transcripts can be detected by RT-PCR. We named this allele rbb1-2.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125621.g005. Fig 5. . The RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450.. (a) Schematic structure of the RBB1 locus indicating the positions of rbb1 alleles. Exons are indicated as black boxes and introns are indicated as white boxes. 5' and 3' UTRs are indicated in gray. Triangles indicate T-DNA insertions of SALK lines. The position of three diagnostic RT-PCR amplicons at the 5 end, middle and 3 end are shown. (b) Accumulation of RBB1 transcripts as determined by RT-PCR with gene specific primers in seedlings from Col-0 (WT), rbb1-2, the GFP-TIP2;1 parental line and rbb1-1. Three pairs of gene specific primers were used to detect the transcript at the 5' end, middle, and 3' end of the RBB1 gene as indicated in (a). Numbers represent amplicon size. (c-e) Lack of genetic complementation between rbb1-1 and rbb1-2. Hypocotyls of four-day-old dark-grown seedlings from the parental control (WT, c), rbb1-1 (d) and the F1 progeny from a cross between rbb1-1 and rbb1-2 (rbb1-1/rbb1-2 double heterozygotes, e) were imaged by confocal microscopy. Scale bar: 20mum. (f-g) rbb1-2 contains bulbs in a similar manner as rbb1-1. Four-day-old seedlings were stained with 2 muM Lysotracker Red for 2 hours to label the vacuole in Col-0 (WT) and rbb1-2. Bulbs are indicated with arrows. Scale: 20 mum. (h) RBB1 is expressed in many developmental stages. The accumulation of RBB1 transcripts was determined by RT-PCR with gene specific primers in various tissues of 4 and 7-day old Col-0 (WT) plants. Two pairs of gene specific primers detected the 5' end and 3' end of RBB1 gene as indicated in (a).. . . . To determine if RBB1 is At5g40450, a complementation test between rbb1-1 and rbb1-2 was carried out. F1 seedlings from a cross between rbb1-1 and homozygous rbb1-2 were incubated in the dark and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for the bulb phenotype. As shown in Fig 5E, the double heterozygote F1 plants display the rbb1 phenotype and indicate the lack of complementation between the two mutant alleles. We were unable to confirm this result in the F2 population as the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene was consistently silenced in the segregating population whenever the SALK insertion was present. This result is consistent with highly silenced transgenes in SALK insertion lines [39]. To confirm the identity of RBB1, we visualized the vacuole morphology of rbb1-2 mutants with Lysotracker Red, a fluorescent dye that stains acidic organelles including plant vacuoles [40] and the tonoplast membrane [41, 42] (S4 Fig). This experiment could only be carried out in cotyledons from light-grown seedlings as penetration of fluorescent dyes in hypocotyls is very poor. Similar to the reduced number of bulbs in the GFP-TIP2;1 line, bulbs were rarely detected in wild type Col-0 cotyledons (Fig 5F and S1 Movie). On the contrary, the rbb1-2 mutant allele showed a similar bulb phenotype as the rbb1-1 mutant with 4-5 vacuolar bulbs per cell in these cells (Fig 5G and S2 Movie). This phenotype also segregated as ~1/4 and therefore rbb1-2 is likely to be recessive. These results confirmed that the RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450 and that the bulb phenotype may be detected in the absence of the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene.. At5g40450 encodes a large protein of 2,890 amino acids. The mutation in rbb1-1 is a C/T nucleotide substitution that results in an A1070V substitution in the predicted protein sequence. BLASTp analysis in NCBI identified only two proteins with protein similarity covering at least 40% of the RBB1 protein sequence, CARUB_v10003962mg from Capsella rubella and EUTSA_v10027617mg from Eutrema salsugineum. All other hits (~40) show high similarity to a 75 amino acid region at the C terminus of RBB1. Remarkably, no significant similarity was found outside of plant taxa using BLASTp, which indicates that RBB1 is a plant-specific protein. In addition, no specific domain hits were detected using the Conserved Domain Database search function in NCBI [43], but regions of similarity to three multi-domain structures were detected. Only two proteins were identified with significant similarity to RBB1 in C. rubella and E. salsugineum. RBB1 belongs to the putative Plant Model Organism Orthologous Group APK_ORTHOMCL5144, which includes genes from Rice, Poplar, Sorghum, Maize, and Brachypodium (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ortholog_group_apk.pl). This group is also supported by gene family clustering of orthologous genes in Phytozome (www.phytozome.net) [44]. The putative orthologs also encode very large proteins (up to 3,715 aa). One of the putative orthologs, Ricinus communis gene 29917.t000066, contains a 32 amino acid region that is 32% identical to the microtubule-associated protein futsch in Drosophila melanogaster. These results overall indicate that RBB1 is a novel plant-specific protein with unknown molecular function.. In order to determine the spatial and temporal expression of RBB1, the accumulation of RBB1 transcripts was analyzed by RT-PCR in Col-0 wild type plants. RBB1 accumulated at similar levels in 4- and 7-day-old light-grown seedlings, and in rosette leaves and inflorescences (Fig 5H). These results are consistent with publicly available databases for At5g40450. According to Arabidopsis eFP browser [45], RBB1 is expressed in leaves and roots of both seedlings and mature plants, flowers and all stages of embryo development. Seedlings treated for 12 h with ABA, heat, cold and osmotic stress have decreased levels of RBB1 transcripts [45, 46]. In contrast, 3 h treatment with photosystem II inhibitor N-octyl-3-nitro-2,4,6-trihydroxybenzamide (PNO8) or the brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor brassinazole 220 resulted in a 2-fold induction of RBB1 [47]. These results indicate that RBB1 may have important functions in multiple developmental stages. The RBB1 transcript accumulation was also analyzed in the parental line and rbb1-1, but no differences in the expression level were detected (Fig 5B). Therefore, the rbb1-1 mutation did not affect the expression of RBB1 at the transcriptional level.. . . RBB1 is a cytosolic protein. In order to characterize the function of RBB1, a fluorescent protein (FP) fusion was generated to visualize its protein localization. Given the large size of the RBB1 coding sequence, we used Recombineering [32] to generate a FP fusion with RBB1 driven by its own promoter and other regulatory sequences. This system utilizes homologous recombination with TAC clones to fuse the gene encoding 3xYpet (YFP for energy transfer), a bright variation of YFP [48], to the gene of interest within the native genomic context. Both N- and C-terminal fusions of RBB1 with 3xYpet were generated and introduced into Col-0 wild type. We could not detect fluorescence in RBB1-3xYpet lines after selection of 15 independent transformants. However, 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in cotyledon epidermal cells, root cortical cells and, although very faint, in the cortex of hypocotyls of light-grown seedlings (S5A and S5B Fig). No Ypet signal was detected at the root tip corresponding to the cell division zone. In order to determine if the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion is functional, we introgressed the transgene into the rbb1-2 allele by crossing. This experiment was carried out in rbb1-2 because the GFP-TIP2;1 marker in rbb1-1 is tightly linked to the RBB1 locus and the probability of identifying rbb1-1 segregants without GFP-TIP2;1 was very low. In contrast to rbb1-2 seedlings stained with Lysotracker red, which showed many bulbs in cotyledons (Fig 6A), rbb1-2 seedlings expressing the 3xYpet-RBB1 protein have vacuole morphology very similar to the wild type (Fig 6B and 6C). Therefore, the 3xYpet-RBB1 construct complements the bulb phenotype of rbb1-2 indicating that this fusion protein is functional.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0125621.g006. Fig 6. . 3xYpet-RBB1 is a cytoplasmic protein that associates with the tonoplast.. (a-c) A 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion complements the bulb phenotype of rbb1-2. Four-day-old seedlings from rbb1-2 (a) or rbb1-2 3xYpet-RBB1 (b, c) were stained with Lysotracker Red (magenta, a, b) to label the vacuole. The signal from 3xYpet-RBB1 (c) for the complemented plant is shown. (d-f) 3xYpet-RBB1 does not co-localize with FM4-64. Images show the cotyledon of 7-d-old seedlings expressing 3xYpet-RBB1 (d) stained with 5 muM FM4-64 (e) and the merged image (f). (g-i) 3xYpet-RBB1 and RFP-SYP22 do not co-localize. Cotyledons of 7-d-old seedlings expressing 3xYpet-RBB1 (g) and RFP-SYP22 (h) were imaged. Merged image (i) is shown. (j-l) 3xYpet-RBB1 and Lysotracker Red do not co-localize in rosette leaves. Seedlings from the 3xYpet-RBB1 line were stained with Lysotracker Red. Signal from 3xYpet-RBB1 (j), Lysotracker Red (k) and the merged image (l) are shown. Arrowheads indicate the localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 at the tip of elongating trans-vacuolar strands. (m-o) GFP molecules can also label the tips of transvacuolar strands. Seedlings from a 35::GFP marker line were stained with Lysotracker Red. The GFP signal (m), Lysotracker Red (n) and the merged image (o) are shown. Arrowheads indicate the tip of TVS. All scale bars = 20 mum. (p) 3xYpet-RBB1 accumulates in the soluble (S100) and membrane pellet (P100) fractions from whole seedlings. Immunoblot of 3xYpet-RBB1 soluble (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions from Col-0 and 3xYpet-RBB1 transgenic plants using antibodies against GFP (alpha-GFP), cFBPase (alpha-cFBPase, control for soluble fraction), and Plasma Membrane H+ATPase (alpha-H+ATPase, control for membrane fraction).. . . . The localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 was diffuse and suggestive of cytosolic localization in cotyledons of 7-day-old seedlings (Fig 6D). In order to determine its sub-cellular distribution in detail, we tested for co-localization between 3xYpet-RBB1 and the plasma membrane dye FM4-64, a marker for the tonoplast, RFP-SYP22 [30], and the vacuole dye Lysotracker Red. The 3xYpet-RBB1 marker does not co-localize with FM4-64 (Fig 6D-6F) or with RFP-SYP22 (Fig 6G-6I). The marker was found in the cytosol and did not co-localize with Lysotracker Red (Fig 6J-6L), even though occasionally there was good co-localization between these two signals (S5C-S5E Fig). These results indicate 3xYpet-RBB1 protein is most likely a soluble protein that accumulates in the cytosol. We also detected 3xYpet-RBB1 in a punctate pattern inside the vacuole that seemed to correspond to the tip of TVS labeled with Lysotracker Red in confocal images (Fig 6J-6L). Interestingly, 3xYpet-RBB1 remained associated with the tip during the elongation of those TVS (S5F Fig) in a similar manner as actin bundles [49]. These TVS structures may represent cross-sections of membrane sheets that transverse the vacuole, as previously proposed [10, 49]. In order to determine the significance of this localization, we compared it to the localization of a soluble GFP marker in the same manner. As shown in Fig 6M-6O, a simple GFP marker can also label the tip of TVS, and therefore, the punctate localization of RBB1 may simply result from accumulation of cytoplasmic proteins at the tip of emerging TVS. Immunoblot analysis was used to confirm that the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion protein accumulates as the expected size of ~400 kDa in seedlings. Membrane and soluble fractions were isolated from wild type Col-0 and the 3xYpet-RBB1 line and the fusion protein was detected with an anti-GFP antibody. The cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBPase) and plasma membrane H+ATPase were used as soluble and membrane protein controls, respectively. 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in both the soluble (S100) and the membrane (P100) fractions in 4 days-old seedlings (Fig 6L and S6 Fig). These results overall indicate that 3xYpet-RBB1 is a large soluble protein that is likely to associate with cellular membranes..
PMC4233638	Results. . Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of TcANR, TcANS and TcLAR genes. The general pathway for the synthesis of proanthocyanidin and anthocyanins indicates the key enzymes ANR, ANS and LAR that carry out the biochemical steps at a critical metabolic branch point (Figure1). To explore the genetic control of this important pathway in cacao, putative TcANR, TcANS and TcLAR cDNA sequences were identified in a collection of Theobroma cacao expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [31] by querying the cacao ESTtik database (http://esttik.cirad.fr/) with protein sequences of Arabidopsis BANYULS (NP_176365), Arabidopsis LDOX (Q96323) and Desmodium LAR (CAD79341). ESTs similar to each gene were assembled into contigs to determine consensus full-length open reading frames (ORF) by alignment with cDNAs of homologous genes from other species and predictions from the ORF Finder program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/). Full-length cDNAs of each gene were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using RNA isolated from young leaves of cacao (Scavina 6). The TcANR cDNA (GU324348) contained a 1,008-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 336 amino acids that showed a 63% identity with the Arabidopsis BANYULS gene at the amino acid level. The TcANS cDNA (GU324350) contained an ORF of 1,062-bp, which encodes a protein of 354 amino acids with 82% amino acid identity with the Arabidopsis LDOX gene. The TcLAR cDNA (GU324352) contained a 1,083-bp ORF encoding a protein of 361 amino acids with 61% amino acid identity with the Desmodium LAR protein.. To determine the genomic sequences of the putative cacao ANS, ANR and LAR genes, the cDNAs were used to screen a cacao BAC library by hybridization. A portion of each hybridizing BAC clone was sequenced using primers designed from the corresponding cDNAs. The genomic structure of each gene was established by alignment with its cDNA sequence (Figure2). We also retrieved gene models of the ANS and ANR gene from Arabidopsis (AT4G22880 and AT1G61720) and LAR from Medicago and grape (BN000703 and NC_012007 c2622652-2619277) and compared them with the corresponding cacao genes.. . Figure 2. . Structures of cacao TcANR, TcANS and TcLAR genes with predicted protein domains, and comparison with their orthologues from Arabidopsis (AtANR and AtANS), Medicago (MtLAR) and Vitis (VvLAR). Green boxes represent exons and lines introns. Lengths in base pairs are indicated by the scale at the bottom.. . . . The coding region of TcANR (GU324347) consisted of 6 exons and 5 introns distributed over 2,005-bp. The coding region of TcANS (GU324349) was shorter, having only 1,418-bp and consisting of 2 exons and 1 intron. The genomic organizations of these two cacao genes were nearly identical to the corresponding Arabidopsis genes, which had the same exon and intron numbers. Moreover, the lengths of the exons were very similar between Arabidopsis and cacao: for ANR, the numbers of nucleotides were precisely the same for the exons 2, 3, 4, and 5, although the lengths of introns were more variable.. Since LAR does not have an orthologue in Arabidopsis, we compared the genomic organization of TcLAR with MtLAR and VvLAR (Figure2). The genomic organization of the coding region of TcLAR (GU324351) was similar to both MtLAR and VvLAR, consisting of 5 exons and 4 introns. As observed with the ANR gene, the middle three exons (exon 2, 3 and 4) of LAR from all three species had identical lengths. TcLAR exhibited an extremely long third intron of 2,338bp; similarly, VvLAR also featured a long third intron of 1,661bp, while MtLAR contained two long introns (intron 1 and intron 2) that are 812-bp and 1,178-bp respectively.. The analysis of the complete cacao genome sequence of the criollo variety was consistent with these results and allowed us to localize the position of each gene relative to the molecular-genetic map [32]. The ANR gene was located on chromosome 6 (Tc06_g018030, GenBank: GU324347.1) and was 99.75 identical to the cDNA described above. Similarly, a single ANS gene was located on chromosome 3 (Tc03_g026420, GenBank: GU324349.1) and shared 99.3% identity to the cDNA described above. The LAR gene was also located on chromosome 3 Tc03_g002450, GenBank: GU324351.1) and shares 98.5% identity to its corresponding cDNA. However, two more distantly related genes were identified in the cacao genome assembly that were not identified in the cacao EST collection. One gene (Tc05_p002410) encodes a protein that shares only 37% identity and 57% similarity with the TcANS protein and a second (Tc02_g034610) shares 63% identity and 76% similarity with the TcLAR protein. For this study, we focused our further work on the three genes of highest similarity to the well-characterized corresponding Arabidopsis and Desmodium genes.. LAR and ANR proteins belong to the reductase-epimerase-dehydrogenase (RED) superfamily, although their relationships are rather distant. ANS belongs to a different protein superfamily, the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2-ODD) superfamily, although it shares the same substrate with LAR (Figure1). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method with the sequences of functionally-tested proteins of LAR, ANR, ANS and DFR from various plant species. The tree construction also included all the IFR-like proteins from Arabidopsis that are most closely related to LAR proteins (Figure3, see protein alignment in Additional file 1: Figure S1). The tree was noticeably bifurcated into two clades: all RED proteins (including ANR, LAR, DFR and IFR) constituting one clade, and all ANS proteins constituting the other. Within the RED superfamily clade, the IFR, LAR, ANR and DFR proteins are clearly divided into four distinct groups with IFR and LAR forming a subgroup that is distantly related to the subgroup formed by DFR and ANR groups. The cacao ANR, ANS and LAR proteins used in the current research all clustered within their own groups.. . Figure 3. . Phylogenetic analysis of the LAR, ANS and ANR proteins as well as related IFR and DFR proteins of the RED superfamily. The protein sequences were aligned as described in Material and Methods. The scale bar represents 0.2 substitutions per site. Numbers indicate bootstrap values. The tree includes LAR, ANR and ANS proteins from cacao, which are shown in bold font, as well as from other species whose enzymatic activities have been shown in previous publications. Also included in the tree are 8 IFR like proteins from Arabidopsis (labeled with their locus numbers). All the other proteins are labeled by the species they come from followed by their catalytic activities. The species represented and their GenBank accession numbers in the LAR group are Medicago (MtLAR, CAI56327), Vitis vinifera (VvLAR, CAI26309), Desmodium uncinatum (DuLAR, CAD79341), Malus domestica (MdLAR1, Q5D7Y1; MdLAR2, Q5D7Y2) and Lotus corniculatus (LcLAR1-1, ABC71324; LcLAR1-2, ABC71325); in the DFR group are Zea mays (ZmA1, CAA28734), Arabidopsis thaliana (AtDFR, NP_199094) and Medicago truncatula (MtDFR, AAR27014); in the ANR group are Arabidopsis thaliana (BAN, NP_176365), Medicago truncatula (MtANR, AAN77735), Vitis vinifera (VvANR, CAD91911), Camellia sinensis (CsANR, AAT68773) and Lotus corniculatus (LcANR, ABC71337); and in the ANS group are Perilla frutescens (PfANS, O04274), Arabidopsis thaliana (AtANS, Q96323), Zea mays (ZmA2, CAA39022) and Medicago truncatula (MtANS, ABU40983). The sequence alignment used to generate this figure can be found in Additional file 1: Figure S1.. . . . . . Expression profiles of TcANR, TcANS and TcLAR genes. To assess the involvement of TcANR, TcANS and TcLAR in PA biosynthesis in cacao, transcript levels were investigated in various tissues including leaves, flowers and pod tissues (Figure4A, tissue definition and collection are described in Methods). Gene transcripts levels were assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. TcActin was chosen as a reference to normalize gene expression because both cacao microarray analyses (Z. Shi and S. Maximova, unpublished data) and data from this study suggested a relatively constant spatial and temporal expression of this gene for all cacao tissues examined. PA synthesis genes, TcANR, TcANS and TcLAR were expressed in all tissues examined, with relatively higher expression levels in pod exocarp and seeds and lower expression in leaves and flowers. Moreover, their expression levels were relatively similar within each tissue except seeds, in which the expression level of TcLAR was much lower than TcANR and TcANS.. . Figure 4. . Expression analysis of key PA biosynthesis genes, and PA composition in various tissues of Theobroma cacao. A, Gene expression levels of TcANR, TcLAR1 and TcLAR1. Expression was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR normalized relative to the expression of TcActin in each sample. B, Levels of soluble PAs expressed as mg PA per g of dry weight.

F, Flavan-3-ol accumulation and composition analyzed by HPLC. All data are presented as means  SE, for gene expression data, n  3, for PA level data, n  5. DW, dry weight.. . . . . . PA levels in various cacao tissues. To determine the concentrations of PAs in different cacao tissues, samples were first extracted to obtain a soluble PA fraction. The residues left after soluble PA extraction were assayed using butanol-HCl (Yu-Guang [33]) to measure the amount of insoluble PAs represented as larger polymers. Because insoluble PA polymers will crystallize and bind to proteins and cell wall components, this interference may reduce the extraction efficiency of the insoluble PAs [24,34]. As a result, comparing the relative amount of these two fractions within the same tissue is difficult. However, the accumulation pattern of each fraction is comparable among different tissues. High levels of both soluble and insoluble PAs were detected in all tissues examined, ranging from approximately 40mg/g DW in seeds to more than 170mg/g DW in exocarp for soluble PAs (Figure4B) and ranging from approximately 1.2mg/g DW in seeds to 8mg/g DW in exocarps for insoluble PAs (Figure4C). The accumulation of both soluble and insoluble PAs were in good correlation with the expression patterns of PA synthesis genes, both of which showed highest levels in fruit exocarp. However, both soluble and insoluble PA levels were much lower in seeds than in other tissues, which correlated with TcLAR but not TcANR and TcANS.. To determine the composition of monomer PAs in cacao, soluble PAs extracts prepared from all four tissues were further separated and quantified by HPLC. The data are presented for catechin and epicatechin concentrations as mug of catechin or epicatechin per g of dry tissue (Figure4D-F). PAs consisted almost entirely of epicatechin with less than 2% catechin. In all tissues examined, the accumulation of both catechin and epicatechin were well correlated with the expression of TcLAR and TcANR. In exocarp, where both TcLAR and TcANR had the highest expression among all tissues tested, both catechin and epicatechin were also at maximal levels. In leaves and flowers, where TcANR expression was much lower, epicatechin was found at correspondingly lower levels. Likewise in seeds, which exhibited a much lower expression of TcLAR, catechin levels were also much lower.. . . Functional analysis of the TcANR gene. While the sequences and expression patterns of the candidate cacao PA biosynthesis genes were consistent with their candidate functions relative to enzymes from other species, we conducted in vivo functional analysis of each gene in transgenic plants to gain direct evidence for their functions. To investigate the in vivo function of TcANR, a genetic complementation experiment was performed by transferring the TcANR coding sequence under the control of an enhanced expression promoter (E12omega, a modified CaMV35S promoter having the omega arrangement derived from tobacco mosaic virus) into the Arabidopsis banyuls (ban) mutant, which is defective in the gene encoding ANR [22]. ban mutant seeds are pale yellow due to a lack of PAs, and there is more purple anthocyanin pigment deposited in hypocotyls compared to Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) control plants due to increased metabolic flux into this branch of the pathway. From eight independent transgenic TcANR-overexpressing lines tested, five lines showed white hypocotyls, and 3 lines showed reduced pigmentation in hypocotyls as compared to banyuls mutants. The lines with white hypocotyls also produced seeds exhibiting the wild-type phenotype that stained blue with DMACA reagent, suggesting the deposition of PAs in the seed coat (Figure5A). After PA extraction and quantification, all lines showed significantly increased levels of PAs (Figure5C). RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of TcANR, and the expression levels positively correlated with PA accumulation (Figure5B).. . Figure 5. .

B, Analysis of TcANR and AtUbi transcripts in total RNA from leaves of plants shown in (A) by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. PCR products from TcANR-pGEM plasmid were loaded on the last lane acting as a positive control for the TcANR primer set and a negative control for the AtUbi primer set. C, PA levels in mature seeds of plants shown in (A). PA levels were determined by extraction and DMACA reaction with procyanidin B2 as standards. All data are presented as mean valuesSE, n=3. *P<0.05 versus ban; **P<0.01 versus ban.. . . . . . Functional analysis of TcANS gene. To investigate the in vivo function of TcANS, two model plants, tobacco and Arabidopsis were utilized. We used an Arabidopsis ans (ldox) mutant to perform tests of transgenic complementation. We used tobacco as a model system for metabolic flux analysis of the equilibrium between PA and anthocyanin synthesis. Introduction of functional ANS genes into tobacco can result in flower petal color changes reflecting alterations in ANS activity.. ANS is involved in both PA synthesis and anthocyanin synthesis, as cyanidin, an anthocyanin precursor, can also be reduced to epicatechin by ANR (Figure1). This was demonstrated in a recent study describing that down regulation of MtANS in Medicago resulted in decreased levels of both PAs and anthocyanins [24]. Based on these results, we reasoned that if the putative cacao ANS protein is truly a functional ANS, over-expression of TcANS in tobacco should result in increased accumulation of both anthocyanins and PAs. The ORF of TcANS, driven by the E12omega promoter, was introduced into wild-type tobacco (cv. Samsun) for constitutive ectopic expression. Twelve independent hygromycin-resistant lines were generated, of which nine showed a visible increase in pink color intensity in flower petals. The two lines displaying the greatest increase in petal color were chosen for further analysis. RT-PCR analysis confirmed high TcANS transcript levels in these two tobacco transgenic lines, which positively correlated with the color of the petals (Figure6A and B). Amplification of the tobacco ribosomal RNA gene NtrRNA, which served as an internal control, showed a relatively similar expression level in both wild-type control and transgenic tobacco plants. As predicted, anthocyanin levels increased in the two transgenic lines (Figure6C).. . Figure 6. . Characterization of transgenic tobacco flowers constitutively expressing TcANS or TcLAR.

Flavan-3-ol accumulation and composition in flowers of wild type (Samsun, ss) tobacco plants and two independent lines of 35S:TcLAR transgenic (LAR7C1, LAR9A2) tobacco plants. Anthocyanin levels were determined by extraction and UV absorption with cyanidin 3-glucoside as standards. Total soluble PA levels are determined by extraction and DMACA reaction with procyanidin B2 as standards. Flavan-3-ol levels were determined by extraction, HPLC separation, and quantification. All data are presented as mean valuesSE,7.*Pn<0.05 versus WT; **P<0.01 versus WT.. . . . The levels of PAs in the petals of transgenic lines, quantified by DMACA assays, were also significantly higher as compared to untransformed Samsun plants (Figure6D). On average, a two-fold increase of PA was observed in the two lines compared to wild type.. The 35S-TcANS transgene was also introduced into the Arabidopsis ans (ldox) T-DNA mutant, which produces hypocotyls that appear white to light green due to lack of anthocyanins, and seeds that appear light yellow due to lack of PAs. Eighteen independent hygromycin resistant transgenic T1 seedlings were selected. From these, 2 lines developed wild-type purple colored hypocotyls (Additional file 1: Figure S2) and produced wild-type brown-colored seeds that stained blue after reacting with the DMACA reagent. The color suggested deposition of PAs in the seed coat, however the color intensity was lower than in wild type. RT-PCR using RNA extracted from T2 seedlings confirmed expression of TcANS genes (data not shown).. . . Functional analysis of the TcLAR gene. Because the LAR gene is not present in Arabidopsis [15], we cannot obtain direct evidence of the in vivo function of TcLAR through genetic complementation analysis in Arabidopsis. Therefore, to functionally characterize TcLAR, we used tobacco as a model system. As over-expression of the ANR gene can divert the metabolic flow from anthocyanin synthesis to PA synthesis [17], we predicted that over-expression of the cacao LAR gene in tobacco would result in a decrease in anthocyanin pigment and an increase in PA accumulation in flower petals. Transgenic tobacco plants were generated that constitutively expressed the ORF of TcLAR under the control of the E12omega promoter. Twenty-two independent transgenic lines that are resistant to hygromycin were generated. Nine of these exhibited a decrease in intensity of the visible pink color of petals. Two lines (Lines LAR7C1 and LAR9A2) exhibited virtually white petals (Figure6E). RT-PCR showed that both lines expressed high levels of TcLAR transcripts (Figure6F). Quantification of soluble PA and anthocyanin levels indicated that anthocyanin levels in these two lines were about half those of WT controls, and that total PAs accumulated to an approximately 5-fold higher level than in controls (Figure6G and H).. Moreover, the levels of PAs in transgenic tobacco petals were inversely proportional to the concentrations of anthocyanin, indicating diversion of metabolic flow from anthocyanin to PA synthesis. Insoluble PA levels were also estimated, but the levels were insignificant (data not shown). To confirm the increased accumulation of catechin, as it is the predicted product of TcLAR, we separated and quantified the PA extracts using HPLC. The HPLC analysis showed that there is indeed an approximately 2-fold increase of catechin levels in both transgenic lines. Surprisingly, there is also a significant increase of epicatechin levels (Figure6I).. We also took advantage of the Arabidopsis ans (ldox) T-DNA mutant to examine LAR function. Because Arabidopsis lacks an LAR gene [12,14,15] and the ldox mutant is deficient in cyanidin (the substrate for ANR), the ldox mutant exhibits a significant decrease of epicatechin and PA synthesis. We reasoned that since the ldox mutant accumulates leucoanthocyanidin which can provide the substrate for a heterologous LAR protein, the ldox mutant was potentially a good in vivo model to analyze LAR function. We predicted that over-expression of TcLAR should result in the synthesis of catechin in developing siliques of the ldox mutant Arabidopsis, even if PAs were not produced due to lack of epicatechin synthesis. HPLC separation and quantification of PA extracts from Arabidopsis transgenic lines over-expressing TcLAR gene in the ldox mutant background revealed not only a significant increase of catechin, but also surprisingly, a modest increase of epicatechin (Figure7). Quantification of total PAs extracted from mature seeds also revealed significant PAs increases in all transgenic lines compared to the ldox mutant (Additional file 1: Figure S4).. . Figure 7. .

The data are presented as meansSE, n=3. *P<0.05 versus ldox; **P<0.01 versus ldox. FW, fresh weight; EU, emission units.. . . . These unexpected results prompted us to check the possibility that TcLAR may carry a dual enzymatic activity, capable of converting leucoanthocyanidin to both catechin and epicatechin. Thus, recombinant TcLAR protein was expressed in E. coli, purified and assayed using 3H -labeled leucocyanidin as substrate in the presence of NADPH, followed by analysis of products by HPLC-UV and radioactivity detection. The negative control reaction (boiled protein) showed no product formation (Figure8A and C), whereas a peak with the same retention time and UV-spectrum as that of the pure (-)-catechin standard (Figure8E and F) was detected when TcLAR protein was incubated with 3H -labeled leucocyanidin (Figure8B and D). However, no epicatechin product was detected (the retention time of 26-27min), suggesting that TcLAR does not exhibit duel functionality in this in vitro assay.. . Figure 8. .

PMC3512138	Resultsdms4-1 suppressor screen: dominant intragenic suppressor mutations in M1 plantsThe scheme for the suppressor screen is illustrated in Figure 1A. Here we focus on mutations that restore both RdDM/GFP silencing and normal development (dominant sdm mtuants, Figure 1A). For the screen, we used the dms4-1 allele, which has a mutation in the splice site acceptor of the sixth intron. This mutation disrupts the open reading frame, leading to an altered amino acid sequence in the final third of the DMS4 protein (Kanno et al. 2010). Approximately 14,400 dms4-1 seeds (BC1F3 generation) were treated with EMS according to standard protocols and sown on soil. As the M1 plants were bolting, flowering and setting seed, we noticed nineteen that had wild-type characteristics, being taller than dms4-1 mutants and displaying normal leaves, phyllotaxy, and flowers (Figure 1B). Several of these M1 plants appeared chimeric, containing both wild-type and dms4-1 sectors (Figure 2, A-C).Figure 1Flow chart of dms4 suppressor screening and phenotype of M1 suppressor mutant. (A) The dms4-1 mutant is GFP+, due to loss of RdDM at the upstream target enhancer, and displays a distinctive developmental phenotype. Seeds of the dms4-1 mutant were treated with 1% EMS and sown on soil. Wild-type-looking (WT) M1 plants were identified as dominant suppressors and M2 seeds obtained from self-fertilization were harvested from individual WT-appearing plants. All other M1 plants were pooled into batches and the M2 seeds harvested in bulk from each batch (see details in Materials and Methods). M2 seedlings were germinated on plates and screened for GFP- and GFP+ phenotypes, and these groups were further subdivided based on their developmental phenotype (WT-like or dms4-1-like). The sdm (suppressor of dms4) mutants are GFP- and have a WT phenotype; sdr (suppressor of dms4, RdDM) mutants are GFP- but have a dms4-1-like phenotype; and sdd (suppressor of dms4, development) mutants are GFP+ but have a WT phenotype. In this article, we describe four sdm mutants that contain dominant, intragenic suppressor mutations. (B) An M1 suppressor mutant (strain 32-3a) containing the dms4-1s2 suppressor mutation has a WT phenotype, being much taller than the surrounding dwarf dms4 mutant plants and displaying normal flowers and spiral phyllotaxy.Figure 2Chimeric M1 suppressor plant. (A) Photographs of the wild-type (WT) T+S line, the dms4-1 mutant, and an M1 plant that is chimeric for a dominant intragenic suppressor mutation (dms4-1s1). This plant comprises a dms4-1-like sector (bottom red box) and a WT sector with normal flowers (top red box). Close ups of boxed regions are shown in B and C, respectively. (D) Sequencing chromatograms of the DMS4 gene in the WT sector (top) and dms4-1-like sector (bottom) of the chimeric M1 plant shown in A. Arrows indicate positions of the recessive dms4-1 mutation, which is homozygous in both sectors, and the dominant dms4-1s1 mutation, which is heterozygous in the WT sector.To rule out that these wild-type-appearing M1 plants were due to contamination by wild-type seeds, we sequenced the dms4 gene in DNA isolated from leaves of 7 of these plants (the dms4 gene was sequenced in the remaining 12 in the M2 generation) (Table S2). All of the wild-type-appearing plants were homozygous for the original dms4-1 mutation and in addition, each was heterozygous for a second mutation within the dms4 gene. Four different G to A intragenic suppressor mutations, all within 200 bp of the original dms4-1 mutation, were identified (Figure 3A). Chimeric plants containing wild-type and dms4-like sectors were found to be genetic mosaics in which the heterozygous suppressor mutation was detected only in the wild-type leaves (Figure 2D).Figure 3Positions of dms4-1 intragenic suppressor mutations and effects on transcription and translation. (A) Schematic structure of DMS4 gene. Boxes in light blue and blue indicate UTRs and coding regions, respectively. Horizontal arrows indicate positions of primers used for RT-PCR. Black and red vertical arrows indicate, respectively, positions of the dms4-1 mutation and the four dominant intragenic suppressor mutations: dms4-1s1 to dms4-1s4. (B) cDNA sequences of DMS4 transcripts from the WT T+S line, dms4-1, and three suppressor mutants. The blue and red letters/dashes indicate changes caused by the dms4-1 mutation and suppressor mutations, respectively. (C) Predicted amino acid sequences of the DMS4 protein in the region affected by mutations (beginning at N121) in the dms4-1 mutant and three suppressor mutants. Red letters indicate changed amino acids and black letters indicate amino acids that are identical to the WT sequence. (D) Detection of the DMS4 protein by Western blotting in WT T+S, dms4-1, and the four suppressor mutants. In the dms4-1s4 suppressor mutant, the DMS4 protein is somewhat larger and much less abundant, which is consistent with the additional 48 nucleotides in the relatively rare cDNA containing a restored reading frame (Figure S2). Bottom shows the stained membrane as a loading control.Because EMS-induced mutations in the M1 generation are still heterozygous, all of the intragenic suppressor mutations that restore a wild-type phenotype act as dominant mutations. We named the suppressor mutations dms4-1s1, dms4-1s2, dms4-1s3, and dms4-1s4 (Figure 3A). These four intragenic suppressor mutations were recovered multiple times in the M1 population (Table 1). None of the suppressor mutations were observed following a mock treatment of dms4-1 seeds, confirming they did not preexist or occur spontaneously in the mutagenized seed population. Because each M1 plant was derived from an individually mutagenized seed, we could conclude that the suppressor mutations were induced independently multiple times during EMS mutagenesis.Table 1Mutation frequencies of suppressorsAlleleM1 generationM2 generationTotalMutation frequencyPoissonFirst mutagenesis (10,599)dms4-1s11017272.5  10-33.1E-43dms4-1s246109.4  10-41.0E-12dms4-1s34487.5  10-41.0E-09dms4-1s41565.7  10-46.7E-07Total193251Second mutagenesis (3575)dms4-1s17182.2  10-32.1E-13dms4-1s21012.8  10-49.0E-02dms4-1s34041.1  10-33.7E-06dms4-1s42241.1  10-33.7E-06Total14317Two rounds of EMS mutagenesis were carried out on dms4-1 seeds of the BC1F3 and BC2F4 generations, respectively.

The number of times each suppressor mutation was identified in the M1 and M2 generations is indicated together with the mutation frequencies (calculated as the total number of plants having a mutation divided by the size of the M1 population). The average mutation frequencies in the first and second round are 1.2  10-3 and 1.17  10-3, respectively.

Consistent transmission to the M2 generation indicated that the dms4-1 suppressor mutations were present in germ cell progenitors in the L2 layer of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of M1 plants.Figure 4GFP signal and DNA methylation. (A) GFP is silenced in WT T+S seedlings, reactivated in the dms4-1 mutant (Kanno et al. 2010), and resilenced in suppressor mutants dms4-1s1 to dms4-1s4. The suppressor mutant seedlings also show a wild-type phenotype compared to the dms4-1 seedling, which is delayed in germination and development (seedlings were photographed on the same day after sowing on MS medium; the dms4-1 mutant is delayed in development relative to the other genotypes and shows GFP expression in the hypocotyl at this stage (Kanno et al. 2010). (B) Percentages of DNA methylation in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG, CHH, where H is A, T, or C) in the target enhancer region in WT T+S, dms4-1, and suppressor mutants as analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. Following loss of methylation in the dms4-1 mutant, methylation is essentially restored to wild-type levels in the suppressor mutants. (C) Chop-PCR analysis to detect methylation in endogenous targets of RdDM. Genomic DNAs digested by HaeIII were used as templates. Presence or absence of the amplification product in HaeIII panels indicates the presence or absence of methylation, respectively.M2 plants: inheritance of intragenic suppressor mutations and restoration of GFP silencingScreening for GFP- seedlings in the M2 progeny of the remaining M1 plants (approximately five to seven M2 seedlings per M1 plant were sampled) identified additional cases of one of the four previously identified intragenic suppressor mutations (Table 1, Table S3). When transferred to soil and grown to maturity, all of the GFP- M2 plants lacked the developmental defects associated with the dms4-1 mutation. In addition to restoring normal development and GFP silencing, the dms4-1 suppressor mutations fully reestablished DNA methylation of the target enhancer driving GFP expression (Figure 4B) and several endogenous targets of RdDM (Figure 4C).Because the intragenic suppressor mutations were identified in plants grown from separate batches of M2 seeds that did not contain seeds from the suppressor mutants identified in the M1 generation, they are believed to have arisen independently during EMS mutagenesis. In principle-given the dominant nature of the suppressor mutations-the parents of these M2 suppressor mutants could have been detected in the M1 generation but they were apparently overlooked at that time, perhaps owing to the high density at which the M1 plants were grown.Nature of dms4-1 intragenic suppressor mutationsThree of the suppressor mutations, dms4-1s1, dms4-1s2, and dms4-1s3, created new splice site acceptors that were predicted to reestablish the wild-type DMS4 open reading frame (Figure 3B). Sequencing of dms4 cDNAs synthesized from mRNA isolated from each suppressor mutant confirmed that the new splice site acceptors were used, although there was some sequence variability among the cDNA clones due to alternative splicing (Figure S2). Despite minor variations in the amino acid sequence arising from use of the new splice site acceptors (Figure 3C), the DMS4 proteins translated from the resulting cDNAs could be detected on Western blots using a DMS4 polyclonal antibody (Figure 3D) and were fully functional in RdDM/GFP silencing and development, as demonstrated by the phenotypic analyses described above. One suppressor mutation, dms4-1s4, did not create a new canonical splice site acceptor site (Figure 3A) although a rare cDNA that has a nearly wild-type open reading frame was detected in this strain (Figure S2). Accordingly, trace amounts of protein interacting with the DMS4 antibody were observed on the Western blot (Figure 3D). Thus, all phenotypes conditioned by the dms4-1 mutation are corrected by the four intragenic suppressor mutations, which reestablish the correct reading frame of the DMS4 gene.High frequency of suppressor mutationsA total of 51 independent cases of the four dms4-1 suppressor mutations were recovered from an initial population of 10,600 M1 plants (Table 1). The individual mutation frequencies (the number of times a mutation is observed divided by the size of the M1 population) (Jander et al. 2003) ranged from 2.5  10-3 for dms4-1s1 to 5.7  10-4 for dms4-1s4. The average mutation frequency was 1.2  10-3 (Table 1). These frequencies can be compared to those found in a previous case of saturation EMS mutagenesis in Arabidopsis, where the average frequency of mutations in the CSR (CHLORSULFURON/IMIDAZOLINONE RESISTANT 1) gene leading to herbicide resistance was determined (Jander et al. 2003). The CSR gene, which is 2700 bp in length and free of introns, encodes the catalytic subunit of acetolactate synthase (ALS). Four amino acid substitutions resulting from distinct point mutations in the CSR gene prevent binding of various ALS-inhibiting herbicides and hence confer herbicide resistance. The average mutation frequency observed in that study was 1.6  10-5 (Jander et al. 2003). The mutation frequencies we observed are thus 35-150 times higher than reported previously for a case of standard EMS mutagenesis in Arabidopsis.The high mutation frequencies of the dms4-1 suppressor mutations were reproduced in a second trial of EMS mutagenesis using a more advanced generation of dms4-1 seeds (BC2F4). In a population of 3575 M1 plants and their M2 progeny, we retrieved 17 plants containing one of the four dms4-1 intragenic suppressor mutations identified previously, again giving an average mutation frequency of 1.2  10-3 (Table 1).Mutation frequency is not elevated genome-wideThe high frequencies of dms4-1 intragenic suppressor mutations suggested the existence of a hypermutational process that affected the dms4 gene. To test whether a similar elevated mutation frequency would be observed genome-wide, we carried out Illumina whole-genome sequencing on two independently derived strains from the dms4-1s1 and dms4-1s3 suppressor mutants, respectively, and one strain from the dms4-1s4 suppressor mutant. For comparison, we sequenced the genome of the dms4-1 mutant from the BC1F3 generation, which was used for the first EMS mutagenesis treatment in the suppressor screen (Figure 1A), as well as the wild-type transgenic line containing the GFP target locus and silencer locus (T+S) that was used in the original forward screen that identified the dms4-1 mutant (Kanno et al. 2010).Once a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was established for each line, we subtracted SNPs present in the wild-type T+S transgenic line and in the dms4-1 mutant. The remaining SNPs were considered to be ones that were induced by EMS mutagenesis during the suppressor screen. From this analysis, the total number of mutations induced by EMS treatment of dms4-1 seeds ranged from 826 (dms4-1s1, strain 12-1-3) to 2140 (dms4-1s3, strain 3-2-3) (Table 2). These numbers are within the range reported previously for EMS mutagenesis in Arabidopsis (Jander et al. 2003) and hence do not support the occurrence of genome-wide hypermutation in the suppressor mutants. Indeed if hypermutation were occurring throughout the genome at the same frequency observed for the dms4-1 gene, then we should have detected 53,000 mutations in each suppressor mutant [average mutation frequency of dms4-1 suppressor mutations (1.2  10-3; Table 1) times 4.4  107, which is the number of base pairs susceptible to EMS mutagenesis in Arabidopsis (Jander et al. 2003)].Table 2Number of EMS-induced mutations in suppressor mutantsChr 1Chr 2Chr 3Chr 4Chr 5Totaldms4-1s1 (6-3-5)1691832192162661053dms4-1s1 (12-1-3)192123182170159826dms4-1s3 (3-2-3)4483314423625572140dms4-1s3 (3-4-2)2951512841431661039dms4-1s4 (26-4a)24294199160196891Average269.2176.4265.2210.2268.81189.8Whole-genome sequencing was performed on five suppressor mutants (strain number in parentheses) containing the indicated suppressor mutations (left). The number of G/C to A/T mutations on each chromosome as well as the total number of G/C to A/T changes genome-wide (ranging from 826 to 2140) is shown.The mutations were distributed throughout the genome and they affected different categories of sequences (e.g., genes, transposons, pseudogenes) at approximately the same percentage at which they are represented in the Arabidopsis genome (Figure 5). The neighboring nucleotides of the G-to-A transitions induced by EMS treatment are consistent with previously reported results (Greene et al. 2003), with purines being favored in the -1 position (Table S4). There was virtually no overlap among the sets of genome-wide mutations detected in each suppressor mutant; that is, each mutation was induced independently and only once in the M1 seed population. This contrasts to the suppressor mutations, which were induced independently multiple times (Table 1). We confirmed a subset of strain-specific SNPs by using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers (Figure S3).Figure 5Distribution of EMS-induced mutations in suppressor mutants. The positions of unique SNPs on the five chromosomes of suppressor strain dms4-1s1 (6-3-5) are indicated by vertical lines. Similar distributions of unique SNPs were observed in the other suppressor mutants subjected to whole-genome sequencing (not shown). SNPs are distributed among different types of sequences according to their approximate percentage of representation in the A. thaliana genome: genes (blue; 50%), intergenic (red; 40%), pseudogenes (green; 1%), and transposons (yellow; 8%). Red arrowheads indicate the position of centromeres. Some clustering of SNPs in transposons and intergenic regions is seen in centromeric regions.The dms4-1 allele is not a general target of enhanced mutagenesisThe four suppressor mutations were straightforward to detect because they led to reversion of dms4-1 mutant phenotypes (that is, the suppressor mutants were GFP- and had a normal developmental phenotype). To determine whether other G residues in the dms4-1 allele were mutated frequently even in the absence of phenotypic reversion, we sequenced the dms4-1 gene in 100 GFP+ M2 plants. No additional mutations were observed in the dms4-1 allele in any of these plants, indicating that the dms4-1 allele as a whole is not a preferential target of mutagenesis.Mutations in the GFP reporter geneWe also determined the frequency of recessive, loss-of-function mutations occurring in the GFP reporter gene. These mutants could be screened out because they were GFP- but had a dms4-1 developmental phenotype. Sixteen independent GFP- mutants resulting from mutations in the GFP coding sequence were obtained in the initial screen of M2 progeny from 10,600 M1 plants resulting from the first EMS treatment. Although most mutations were observed only once, two were observed multiple times. The resulting mutation frequencies (1.9  10-4 and 2.8  10-4, respectively) are somewhat elevated over previously reported average values (Jander et al. 2003) but do not reach the higher frequencies observed with the dms4-1 allele (Figure S4)..
PMC4566974	Results. . The fdl1-1 mutation causes abnormal seedling development. The fused leaves1-1 (fdl1-1) recessive mutation, originally isolated in the F2 generation of a cross between a En/Spm line and a maize inbred line, was maintained by outcrossing fdl1-1 homozygous plants to different inbred lines (A188, W64A, H99 and B73) for two or three generations. In all genetic backgrounds F2 progeny carrying the fdl1-1 mutation segregated 3:1 for seedlings with abnormal morphology, which could be macroscopically distinguished from wild-type seedlings (Fig. 1).. . Fig. 1.. . Seedling phenotypes and developmental profile of fdl1-1. Representative wild-type (A-D) and mutant (E-H) seedlings were photographed at successive stages of development: coleoptile (A, E), first leaf (B, F), second leaf (C, G) and third leaf (D, H). The developmental profile of fdl1-1 mutant (m) and wild-type (wt) seedlings is presented as percentage of seedlings in each stage at a specific time after initiation of cultures (I). Between 30 and 40 seedlings were analysed for each time point. 0, coleoptile presence; 1, first leaf presence; 2, second leaf presence, 3, third leaf presence; 4, fourth leaf presence; DAC, days after initiation of cultures.. . . . The fdl1-1 mutation specifically affected the early stages of seedling development, from germination to the 3-4 leaf stage, causing a general delay in germination and seedling growth as well as phenotypic abnormalities (Fig. 1E-G). An evident trait in mutant seedlings was the presence of a slightly thicker coleoptile (Fig. 1E). In contrast with wild-type leaves that elongated straight following their emergence from the coleoptile tip (Fig. 1A, B), mutant leaves emerged from the coleoptile in a warped manner, and appeared rolled and twisted (Fig. 1F, G). Moreover, regions of adhesion between the coleoptile and the first leaf, and between the first and the second leaf were observed and interfered with leaf expansion, causing bending of seedlings (Fig. 1G). After the third leaf stage, most of the mutant plants resumed normal phenotypic development and were indistinguishable from the wild-type plants (Fig. 1D, H).. The phenotypes of the fdl1-1 mutants were rather variable. The most severe phenotypes exhibited extremely stunted growth and heavily rolled (Supplementary Fig. S1A) or fractured (Supplementary Fig. S1B) leaves. In most of the mutant seedlings the first and second leaves appeared fused (Supplementary Fig. S1C) and showed remnants of the fusion at later stages (Supplementary Fig. S1D, E). To compare mutant and wild-type growth rate, seedlings belonging to the same F2 progeny were allowed to germinate on wet filter paper and, at succeeding time points, classified according to their stage of development into specific classes: presence of coleoptile (stage 0, Fig. 1A, E), first leaf (stage 1, Fig. 1. B, F), second leaf (stage 2, Fig. 1. C, G), third leaf (stage 3, Fig. 1D, H) and fourth leaf (stage 4). Ten days after culture initiation (DAC), the majority of wild-type plants had reached stage three, whereas the majority of the mutant seedlings were in stage one (Fig.1. I). Similarly, at later times (12 and 14 DAC), a substantial percentage of wild-type plants had already reached stage four, whereas mutant plants were at earlier stages. At 16 and 18 DAC, the discrepancy between wild-type and mutant was less consistent.. The strongest phenotypes, i.e. seedlings at stage one after 18 days of culture, representing 21.05 % of the mutant seedlings, arrested their growth, whereas the rest of the mutants, after the emergence of the third/fourth leaf, resumed almost normal growth, except for a reduction in their height. They could be grown to maturity and were fertile.. To better examine the effect of the mutation on seedling organization, mutant germinating shoots were analysed by scanning electron microscopy. Mutant coleoptiles appeared thicker and variably misshapen (Fig. 2B-F) compared to wild-type (Fig. 2A). Soon after emergence wild-type coleoptiles exhibited an aperture at the top from which leaves easily emerged (Fig. 2A); in contrast, mutant coleoptiles often showed a lateral subapical slit (Fig. 2B). Mutant leaves did not emerge from the tip but from the side of the coleoptile by forcing and breaking its tissues (Fig. 2C, D), apparently because the upper leaf region was joined with the coleoptile apex (Fig. 2E). Finally, leaf detachment occurred through apical tissue tearing. In some greatly deformed mutant seedlings, coleoptile and first leaf were not easily distinguishable (Fig. 2F).. . Fig. 2.. . Scanning electron microscope micrographs of wild-type (A) and fdl1-1 mutant (B-F) germinating seedlings. (A) The first leaf emerges from the aperture at the top of a wild-type coleoptile.

To ascertain if the fdl1-1 phenotype was detectable prior to germination, both SEM and histological analysis were carried out on wild-type and homozygous mutant immature seeds from segregating F2 ears.. SEM analysis revealed that in immature 18 DAP wild-type seeds (Fig. 3A) the embryo shoot was enveloped by the scutellum, from which only the apical region of the coleoptile emerged. By contrast, in mutant seeds (Fig. 3B) the scutellum is less curved, leaving the embryo shoot uncovered. Moreover, the embryo shoot exhibited external malformations with incomplete surfaces and irregular openings of coleoptile and first leaf. At the same stage light microscope observations of thin transversal sections disclosed the presence of wide areas of coleoptile and first leaf fusion in the mutant embryo (Fig. 3E, F) that were absent in wild-type embryos (Fig. 3C, D). In the fused regions the two organs were not clearly distinguishable, since attribution of cells to the coleoptile or leaf was not feasible (Fig. 3F). In addition, the sections showed that, contrary to wild type, the mutant scutellum did not extend towards the adaxial face of the embryo shoot and that the coleoptile and first leaf had incomplete and opened surfaces.. . Fig. 3.. . Scanning electron microscope (A, B) and light microscope (C-F) micrographs of the shoot region of 18 DAP embryos. (A) A wild-type embryo with the coleoptile enveloped by the scutellum.

Taken together, these observations indicate that the effect of the fdl1-1 mutation is exerted prior to germination. Accordingly, mutant seedlings cultivated through embryo rescue exhibited morphological defects. Seedlings showing all the typical fdl1-1 traits were detected, with the expected segregation ratio, in cultures obtained from immature embryos deriving from the same F2 ear (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Moreover, mutant seedling growth was reduced and delayed in comparison with that of wild-type siblings (Supplementary Fig. S1G). After 20 days of in vitro growth, most of the mutant seedlings (90%) from 12 DAP old embryos were at stage zero, whereas the majority of wild-type seedlings (80%) had already reached stage one. In cultures initiated from 18 DAP embryos the developmental profiles were less divergent. Among wild-type seedlings, stage two and three were the most represented (37.5% and 57.5% respectively); among mutant seedlings 55.2% reached stage three, while the growth of the remaining seedlings was at earlier stages.. . . Analysis of tissues identities and cuticle and epicuticular wax deposition in mutant seedlings. To better examine the effect of the mutation on the early phases of plant development, apical and basal cross-sections of wild-type (Fig. 4. A, B) and mutant (Fig. 4C, D) seedlings at the coleoptile stage were compared through light microscopy analysis. In the wild-type sections, leaves were enclosed and regularly rolled within the coleoptile and always appeared as distinct structures (Fig. 4A, B). In contrast, in the mutant apical sections, the inner surface of the coleoptile was fused with masses of a presumed first leaf tissue, lacking organization and exhibiting unclear cell identity (Fig. 4C). In the basal sections wide regions of fusion between coleoptile and first leaf epidermises and between epidermises of adjacent leaves were present (Fig. 4D).. . Fig. 4.. .

In areas involving coleoptile and first leaf fusion, epidermal cell shapes were frequently altered, whereas fused epidermal cells between two leaves assumed a more regular shape.. . Fig. 5.. .

(C) The tissue organization of fused blades from succeeding leaves does not show significant alterations. In the more differentiated leaf, xylem vessels are regularly distributed in the parallel bundles, the epidermises are recognizable and have stomata (arrow head) in the free regions. co, coleoptile; lf, leaf. Bars, 50 mum.. . . . Fluorescence microscopy analysis of fused regions revealed that in the merged zone between leaf blade and edge of coleoptile lateral opening, cells of the two organs were indistinguishable and the boundary was no longer clearly recognizable (Fig. 5B). By contrast, the blades of adjacent leaves had recognizable epidermises with fused areas and free regions. The latter also showed well-differentiated stomata as evidenced by the intense autofluorescence of their cell walls (Fig 5C).. TEM analysis revealed that, within zones of fusion between two organs, mutant cells were joined by an apparent single cell wall (Fig. 6A), the cell wall proper of each of them being undistinguishable. While a thick, continuous cuticle layer could be seen on the cell walls of separated epidermises in adjacent zones (Fig. 6B, D, F) covering the free surfaces of the two organs even in the initial point of separation (Fig. 6D, E), cuticular material was not detectable between joined cell wall zones even at higher magnification (Fig. 6C). Moreover, the cuticle was always detectable along free epidermises (Fig. 6F) and fusion was never found between cutinized surfaces of leaves or other plant organs.. . Fig. 6.. .

(F) The cuticle overlays the surfaces of two unfused leaf epidermises. co, coleoptile; cu, cuticle; lf, leaf. Bars: 1 mum (A, B); 0.5 mum (C, F); 0.25 mum (D, E).. . . . Toluidine blue stained roots and seeds (which are devoid of cuticular material), whereas it did not stain aerial parts of wild-type or mutant seedlings, with the exception of mutant coleoptile fractured edges (Supplementary Fig. S2) since this dye permeates epidermal surfaces only if the cuticle is absent or defective. According to this assay (Tanaka et al., 2004), the cuticle covering the free surfaces of mutant leaves displayed a waterproofing property.. It was also observed that, if mutant seedlings are misted with water, they retain water beads on their surface (Fig. 7D). SEM analysis suggested that this trait could be attributable to the alterations in epicuticular wax deposition, which was less homogenous on the mutant (Fig. 7E), than wild-type (Fig. 7B) surfaces. Indeed, mutant leaf surfaces exhibited a patchy distribution of epicuticular waxes, with some areas evenly covered and others completely devoid (Fig. 7E). This trait, similarly to the other fdl1-1 traits, was confined to the first two leaves, since later leaves show a regular distribution of epicuticular waxes that was indistinguishable from that of wild-type leaves (data not shown).. . Fig. 7.. . Second leaf of wild-type (A) and mutant (D) misted with water and micrographs of epicuticular waxes at scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The epicuticular waxes are regularly distributed on the upper surface of the second leaf of wild-type (B) while they show a patchy deposition on the same leaf of fdl1-1 (E). An irregular distribution of epicuticular waxes can be seen on the second leaf of an RNAi transformed seedling (F) if compared with the second leaf of an untransformed seedling (C). (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . . . The fdl1-1 mutant phenotype is linked to the insertion of a En/Spm element in a R2R3-MYB transcription factor. Chromosomal arm location of fdl1-1 was first established by means of TB-A translocations. Heterozygous +/fdl1-1 females were crossed with a set of heterozygous or hyperploid B-A translocation males. Only the F1 obtained from crosses involving the TB-7L male parent uncovered the mutant phenotype, indicating that fdl1 lies on the long arm of chromosome 7. A more refined position for fdl1 was achieved through analysis of SSR marker distribution in a segregating F2 population obtained by crossing homozygous fdl1-1/fdl1-1 females with H99 inbred male parents. Polymorphism for the markers UMC1125 and UMC1342 allowed the positioning of fdl1 at 6.3 cM from the former and 5.4 cM from the latter. Since no similar mutants have so far been located in this genomic region, it was assumed that the fdl1 phenotype defines a novel gene. The fdl1-1 mutant had been isolated from an active En/Spm line, therefore a co-segregation analysis was performed to identify whether the insertion of an En/Spm element in the fdl1 locus was causing the mutant phenotype. Genomic DNA was extracted from single individuals from F1 and F2 segregating progenies, including homozygous fdl1-1/fdl1-1 mutants, fdl1-1/+ heterozygous and +/+ homozygous wild-types and compared by gel blot analysis. Hybridization of genomic DNAs with the En/Spm-specific probe pbx1, revealed a BamH1 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of approximately 2.6kb co-segregating with the mutant phenotype (Fig. 8A). Cloning of the RFLP highlighted the presence of 78bp of genomic sequence flanking the En/Spm element. When used as a probe against the BamH1 blot, this fragment identified the same 2.6kb mutant RFLP in fdl1-1/+ and fdl1-1/fdl1-1 individuals (Fig. 8B) as well as a 10kb restriction fragment ascribable to the wild-type allele of fdl1-1/+ and +/+ individuals (Fig. 8B). Co-segregation analysis, performed with both the En/Spm probe and the genomic probe on a total of 50 individuals (data not shown) indicated that the element was inserted either in the fdl1 gene itself or in a closely linked locus. Alignment of the 78bp flanking sequence with the maize genome sequence (www.maizesequence.org) placed the En/Spm insertion in the GRMZM2G056407 gene model corresponding to the ZmMYB94 gene, which is located on chromosome 7L in the region delimited by the UMC1125 and UMC1342 markers where the fdl1 gene was mapped.. . Fig. 8.. . . ZmMYB94 gene structure and expression analysis. Southern analysis of fdl1-1 and wild-type alleles (A, B). DNAs from homozygous wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-) and homozygous mutant (-/-) seedlings were cleaved with BamH1.

Bars represent means SD. DAP, days after pollination; cc, inside the closed coleoptile; co, emerging from the open coleoptile; i, immature. Tissue samples are listed in Supplementary Table S2.. . . . . To experimentally validate the gene model, overlapping amplification products were obtained with gene specific primer sets reported in Fig. 8C (5UTR-F and E3-R, ConsFdl1 and 3UTR-R), from wild-type genomic DNA and cDNA and sequenced. Sequences were assembled to generate a contig showing 100% identity with the GRMZM2G056407 gene prediction comprising three exons separated by two introns (Fig. 8C), whose putative product consists of 330 amino acids. Sequence analysis of mutant DNA confirmed that the En/Spm element insertion was within the GRMZM2G056407 coding sequence (data not shown).. To verify the results obtained from the Southern-based co-segregation analysis, a PCR-based analysis was performed on 100 mutant and 40 wild-type F2 individuals, whose genotypes were ascertained by selfing. The two products, of 309bp and 625bp respectively, which are specific for the mutant allele (Supplementary Fig. S3C, D), were always and exclusively present in all mutant samples, whereas the third amplification product of 692bp, was only yielded by wild-types (Supplementary Fig. S3B). No recombination was detected between the fdl1-1 allele and the En/Spm insertion in the ZmMYB94 gene, indicating a tight linkage between this insertion and the fdl1-1 mutation.. Mutant cDNAs were also amplified by using the same primer sets (Consfdl2-F, Spm1-R; and Spm3-F, AW-R) and produced amplicons of the same size as those obtained from genomic DNA (data not shown). Sequence analysis showed that the fdl1-1 mutant transcript retains the En/Spm element and is predicted to encode a non-functional protein carrying a frameshift mutation at amino acid position 278 and a premature stop codon at position 298.. Seed progeny obtained from crossing fdl1-1 with a waxy (wx) endosperm line homozygous for the wx-m8 allele (Shure et al., 1983), which contains a defective En/Spm element, did not highlight any Waxy revertant sector, suggesting that the element inserted in the fdl1 locus is a non-autonomous element. A similar conclusion arose from the PCR based analysis of DNA extracted from homozygous entire mutant leaves fractionated in sectors. The primer set specific for the mutant allele, i.e. ConsFdl2-F and Spm1-R, gave the expected product, whereas the primer set specific for the wild-type allele, i.e. ConsFdl2-F and AW-R, did not produce an amplicon (data not shown).. Attempts to generate germinal revertants by crossing the mutant line with a line containing an autonomous En/Spm element, as well as to isolate novel transposon-induced alleles through Mutator-targeted mutagenesis were unfruitful (data not shown). Proof of gene identity was thus obtained using an alternative approach consisting of an RNAi experiment, in which ZmMYB94 as well as the closely related paralogue ZmMYB70 (GRMZM2G139284), were targeted. Six independent transformants were obtained and T1 progenies, which showed 50% segregation of transgenic individuals, as expected for single locus insertion, were visually scored for mutant phenotypes. Although the mutant phenotype was very mild and rather sensitive to environmental conditions, transgenic seedlings of two transformants grown at 23C showed some typical fdl1-1 mutant traits consisting of curly leaves and regions of adhesions between the first two leaves (Supplementary Fig. S4B, C, D). In these two transformants the relative expression level of ZmMYB94 in the third leaf was 4% and 5% respectively of that observed in wild-type.. Moreover, SEM analysis of a transformed mutant second leaf revealed an uneven epicuticular wax distribution on its epidermal surface (Fig. 7F) resembling that of the fdl1-1 mutant epidermal surface (Fig. 7E). This pattern was not detected on the second leaf of an untransformed sibling plant (Fig.7C).. . . The expression profile of the ZmMYB94 gene in the seedling overlaps with the pattern of mutant phenotype expression. The spatial and temporal expression profile of the ZmMYB94 gene was analysed by qRT-PCR in different maize tissues (Fig. 8D; Supplementary Table S2), using the AW-F and AW-R ZmMYB94 specific primers. The ZmMYB94 mRNA was detected in all organ/tissues analysed, except in the primary root, and the expression pattern obtained (Fig. 8D) did not deviate from that described in the work of Sekhon et al., (2013). The highest expression (5-fold higher than other tissues) was observed in ear silks. Within the seed, ZmMYB94 was more expressed in the embryo than the endosperm. In the seedling, higher expression levels were observed in the coleoptile and in the first leaf, with a progressive decrease of expression in the second and third leaf. We note that in seedlings, the expression profile detected by qRT-PCR analysis matches the pattern of fdl1-1 phenotypic expression observed (Fig. 1).. . . Phylogenetic analysis. Preliminary phylogenetic reconstructions considering 104 unambiguously alignable amino acid residues from the highly conserved MYB domains of all annotated R2R3-MYB proteins from Z. mays, O. sativa, B. distachyon, A. thaliana and V. vinifera indicate that ZmMYB94 falls within a well supported clade containing representatives of all species considered (Fig. 9A), but did not allow confident assignment of an exact phylogenetic placement. Consideration of only sequences within this clade allowed a subsequent phylogenetic reconstruction including 166 aligned amino acid sites (Fig. 9B), which, while failing to unambiguously resolve all relationships within the MYB subclade, provided strong support for co-orthology of ZmMyb94 and ZmMyb70 with functionally uncharacterized Brachypodium and rice genes and as part of a monocot-specific gene family expansion. Our analyses recover no support for direct orthology between ZmMyb94 or ZmMyb70 and any dicot homologue. Indeed, the most closely related dicot MYBs were V. vinifera MYB30, an additional uncharacterized V. vinifera MYB and a clade of recently duplicated Arabidopsis MYBs (AtMYB30/94/96). The absence of direct dicot orthologues of ZmMyb94 notwithstanding, it is interesting to note that MYB30, MYB94 and MYB96 have all been implicated in the regulation of cuticular wax biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Shepherd et al., 2006; Raffaele et al., 2008; Seo et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2014).. .

PMC2551617	Results. Here, we explored the extent of naturally-occurring variation in NOR DNA methylation among accessions of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. DNA methylation in coding regions of rRNA genes was positively correlated with copy number of 45S rRNA gene and DNA methylation in the intergenic spacer regions. We investigated the inheritance of NOR DNA methylation patterns in natural accessions with hypomethylated NORs in inter-strain crosses and defined three different categories of inheritance in F1 hybrids. In addition, subsequent analysis of F2 segregation for NOR DNA methylation patterns uncovered different patterns of inheritance. We also revealed that NOR DNA methylation in the Arabidopsis accession Bor-4 is influenced by the vim1-1 (variant in methylation 1-1) mutation, but the primary effect is specified by the NORs themselves..
PMC3777163	Results. . 2D-PAGE profiling of hcn-midi RNAs from Arabidopsis leaves. To determine how variable is the profile of hcn-midi RNAs accumulation in fully developed plant tissue, we examined RNA that was isolated from mature, developmentally stable Arabidopsis rosette leaves. Three sets of plants were grown under the same conditions (for details, see Materials and methods), and after 5weeks, rosette leaves were collected and frozen at -80C. Three samples of RNA, which were enriched in molecules that were shorter than 200 nt, were isolated from each harvest. As a result, we obtained 9 RNA samples that were then 5-end labeled with 32P and subjected to 2D-PAGE analysis. After 1D-separation, the fraction of RNA that migrated slower than the 18-nt-long radiolabeled RNA marker but faster than the majority of tRNAs was subjected to 2D-separation. Upon autoradiography, hcn-midi RNAs and si/miRNAs were visualized (Fig.1a). The latter localized to the bottom of the 2D-gel and formed a cluster of unseparated spots (Fig.1a). Subsequently, the amounts of individual midi RNAs were quantified using Multi Gauge software, and comparative analysis of all nine autoradiograms showed that the results were highly reproducible. Consequently, we selected 70 individual spots that were characteristic of all autoradiograms (Fig.1b). Each of these spots was present in all autoradiograms and displayed a similarly high intensity. Together, all of the selected spots represented a characteristic pattern of midi RNA accumulation in Arabidopsis leaves. We also found that the total intensity of the 70 selected spots was higher than that of the cluster of unseparated spots that corresponded to si/miRNAs. Based on this observation, we assumed that all hcn-midi RNA molecules that were characteristic of Arabidopsis leaves accumulated in cells to similar or higher levels than si/miRNAs. Fig.12D-PAGE analysis of the midi RNA fraction that was isolated from Arabidopsis rosette leaves. The directions of electrophoresis in the first and second dimension are indicated by arrows. Characteristic pattern of RNA accumulation in Arabidopsis leaves (a); blue arrow indicates a group of spots that correspond to si/miRNAs. Seventy leaf-specific spots are indicated by red circles (b). Gel fragments that correspond to the marked spots were used for 2D-library construction. . . Identification of hcn-midi RNAs from Arabidopsis leaves. To identify Arabidopsis rosette leaf-specific hcn-midi RNAs, 70 gel fragments corresponding to spots that represented the characteristic pattern of midi RNA accumulation in Arabidopsis leaves were excised from the 2D-gels (Fig.1b), RNA was extracted from those fragments and pooled. In parallel, an entire fraction of RNA that migrated slower than the 18-nt-long RNA marker but faster than the majority of tRNAs was extracted from 1D-gel slices. Both RNA pools were used to generate cDNA libraries (for details, see Materials and methods). The first library was named the 2D-library because its elements were selected based on the 2D-gels. The second library was named the 1D-library because it contained RNA that was extracted from 1D-gels (i.e., the fraction that after separation in a 1D-gel was usually subjected to electrophoresis in a 2D-gel). Thus, the 2D-library represented a subset of the 1D-library. The obtained cDNAs were concatemerized, cloned and sequenced. To prepare the libraries, 3- but not 5-adapter ligation was performed (see Materials and methods). Therefore, all RNA molecules that possessed 3-hydroxyl groups and non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated 5-ends were cloned.. . 2D-library. Five hundred concatemers, each comprising 2-3 individual molecules, were sequenced, and as a result, we identified 67 unique molecules. In several cases, the sizes of these molecules varied by a few nucleotides at the 3- or 5-end. All of these size variants were grouped together, and only the longest molecule from each group was considered for further analyses. The sizes of the identified molecules ranged from 17 to 118 nt. Comparison of the obtained sequences with the Arabidopsis genome database revealed that the majority of the cloned molecules (i.e., at least 59 hcn-midi RNAs) represented fragments of larger RNA species. Accordingly, these molecules could be classified as intermediates of RNA degradation that accumulated in plant cells (see Online Table1). Three molecules were classified as unknown transcripts (or fragments of those transcripts) from intergenic regions and 5 were identified as intact tRNA molecules (tRNAGlu, tRNAGln, tRNAArg and 2 tRNAAsp). Of 59 putative degradants, 32 molecules were derived from tRNA (47.8%) and 25 were derived from rRNA (37.3%) (Fig.2, Online Figs.1 and 2). Only 1 mRNA and 1 snRNA fragment were identified. Exclusively for RNAs that were derived from tRNA, several single nucleotide mismatches to the Arabidopsis genomic sequence were detected during the BLAST search. The comparison of the mismatch locations with the pattern of Arabidopsis tRNA modifications revealed that single nucleotide mutations occurred at positions that were normally occupied by a modified adenosine (m1a). Accordingly, one can assume that these mutations were introduced during reverse transcription.. Fig.2Composition of 2D-(black) and 1D-libraries (gray). Cross hatched square represents full-sized tRNAs. Further analysis revealed that tRNA degradants were derived from only 12 different types of nuclear tRNAs and 10 types of organellar tRNAs (including 2 tRNAs which could hypothetically originate from nuclear as well as organellar genes). We also analyzed how particular tRNA isoacceptors contributed to the degradome. We found fragments of 4 tRNALeu and 4 tRNAGly isoacceptors and fragments of 3 tRNAGlu and 3 tRNAArg isoacceptors (Table1 and Online Fig.1). Interestingly, the majority of the identified tRNA fragments (75%) corresponded to the 3 portion of the full-length molecule. Among these fragments, we found 3 halves and 3 quarters of tRNAs, degradants that were comprised of three-quarters of the full-sized molecule and nearly complete, 5-trimmed tRNAs (Table2). Almost all of these degradants (83.3%) contained an intact CCA sequence (or trimmed -CC or -C nucleotide variants) at their 3 ends. Moreover, none of the tRNA degradants contained 5 leader, 3 trailer or intronic sequences. Degradants that corresponded to the 5 portion of tRNAs were less frequent (25%) and included 5 halves that were predominantly trimmed at their 5 ends (Table2). In two cases, fragments that represented both halves of the same tRNA (tRNAGly and tRNALeu) were identified in the 2D-library..

The second most abundant class of RNA degradants in the 2D-library (25 molecules) consisted of nuclear and organellar rRNA fragments. The vast majority of rRNA fragments were derived from 25S rRNA (10 molecules) and 18S rRNA (9 molecules). The remaining fragments corresponded to 5S rRNA (3 molecules), 23S rRNA (1 molecule) and 16S rRNA (2 molecules) (Online Fig.2). One hcn-midi RNA from the 2D-library was identified as a derivative of the U2.3 small nuclear RNA, and only one sequence was identified as a fragment of an mRNA. The latter was a fragment of the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA that encodes a RING/U-box superfamily protein (AT4G39140).. . . 1D-library. Each of the 350 sequenced concatemers from the 1D-library contained 2-7 individual molecules. As a result, 154 unique RNAs were identified and the size variants were grouped as described above for the 2D-library. The length of these molecules ranged from 15 to 47 nt, and as expected, nearly all of the cloned molecules (except for 7 (4.5%) si/miRNA molecules) were the putative products of RNA degradation (Online Table2). Once again, most of these fragments were classified as tRNA (37%; 57 molecules) or rRNA (30.5%; 47 molecules) derivatives (Fig.2). Additionally, we identified fragments of unknown transcripts that were encoded in the intergenic regions (14.9%; 23 molecules), fragments of mRNAs (9.7%; 15 molecules), and transcripts that originated from transposable elements (2.6%; 4 molecules) and snRNAs (0.7%; 1 molecule) (Fig.2).. . . Comparison of 1D- and 2D-libraries. The 1D-library included high and low copy number midi RNAs, but the 2D-library contained only hcn-midi RNAs. If the same mechanisms are involved in high and low copy number midi RNA formation, the compositions of both libraries should be similar. It means that the libraries should contain the same fractions of degradants that are derived from particular classes of RNA (e.g. tRNA, rRNA and mRNA). To verify this presumption we compared the structures of both libraries. More than half of the RNA degradants from the 2D-library (36 RNAs; including size variants) was also found in the 1D-library. Among these RNAs were fragments of 19 tRNAs, 15 rRNAs and 2 intergenic sequences (IGS). Two types of RNA: fragments of transcripts of transposable elements and si/miRNAs were present only in the 1D-library (Fig.2). In general, the 2D-library was dominated by fragments of tRNA, rRNA, and contained only minor amounts of other RNAs (together, approximately 15%). The composition of the 1D-library was more balanced, and a significant portion of the library (approximately 30%) consisted of derivatives of molecules other than tRNA and rRNA.. . . . Inhibition of in vitro translation by selected tRNA degradants. One of the functions proposed for tRNA fragments is the inhibition of translation. Ivanov et al. (2011) demonstrated that in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate reporter mRNA translation was inhibited by tRNA degradants that: (1) had 5 oligo-guanine (TOG) motif and (2) were predicted by RNAfold to have a single stranded 5 region, followed by a stem-loop and a single stranded 3 region. We identified similar degradants in 2D- (degradants no. 68B and 112A) and 1D- (degradant no. 90) libraries (Fig.3a). To determine if they are also capable of affecting protein synthesis, we tested their influence on in vitro translation of reporter mRNA in a wheat germ extract. In addition, we used 5 fragments of human tRNAAla (Hs-5Ala, 30 nt) and tRNAMet (Hs-5Met, 31 nt). The former fulfilled both structural criteria mentioned above and was shown to be an effective translational inhibitor in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, while the latter lacked a 5 TOG motif and was unable to block translation in the same system (Ivanov et al. 2011). In our assay, uncapped firefly luciferase mRNA that encodes an active enzyme was translated in vitro in the wheat germ extract in the presence of selected degradants (chemically synthesized oligonucleotides). Subsequently, luciferase activity was quantitated. In case of all three degradants from Arabidopsis a significant drop in luciferase activity was detected as compared to a control reaction with no RNA degradant added (p<0.00005, Fig.3b), thus indicating translational arrest. This effect was observed at a relatively low concentration of degradants (1muM). The 5 fragment of human tRNAAla (effective inhibitor in a mammalian system) and the 5 fragment of human tRNAMet (inactive in a mammalian system) did not block translation in the plant in vitro system. Among the Arabidopsis degradants no. 112A (tRNALeu) was the strongest repressor and caused approximately 70% decrease in translation efficiency. The other two degradants reduced translation by c.a. 32% (no. 90, tRNAAla) and 26% (no. 68B, tRNACys). Fig.3Inhibition of in vitro translation by tRNA degradants. a Secondary structures of selected tRNA degradants identified in 2D- (At-112A, At-68B) and 1D- (At-90) libraries, predicted by RNAfold. b Uncapped firefly luciferase mRNA was translated in vitro using wheat germ extract in the presence of tRNA degradants from human cells (Hs-5Ala, Hs-5Met) and Arabidopsis leaves (At-90, At-112A and At-68B). Luciferase activity in the absence of added short RNA (control) is assigned as 100% and luciferase activity in the presence of degradants is relative to control. Means and SD are from three replicates in three independent experiments. RLU relative light unit. . . Examples of endogenous and exogenous factors that may affect the accumulation pattern of hcn-midi RNAs. After characterizing the specific accumulation patterns of hcn-midi RNAs in leaves, we attempted to determine the extent to which this pattern was organ-specific. To this end, RNA samples isolated from Arabidopsis roots and flowers were subjected to 2D-PAGE analysis in the same way as the rosette leaf samples. Subsequently, the obtained gel images were compared (Online Fig.3). In all performed comparative analyses the pattern of the previously selected 70 spots, which corresponded to hcn-midi RNAs from rosette leaves, was applied as a reference.. Quantitative analysis of leaf and root samples revealed that only 11 degradants displayed a significantly altered level of accumulation. All of them were more prevalent in leaves (Fig.4a). Comparison of leaf and flower samples demonstrated 24 significantly differentiating degradants-half of them accumulated to higher levels in leaves, whereas the other half in flowers (Fig.4b). Among the degradants that displayed significant changes in the levels of accumulation in both comparisons, 6 were common-5 of them were more abundant in leaves than in roots or flowers, and 1 had lowest level of accumulation in roots, higher in leaves and highest in flowers. Our results indicated that most degradants are constitutively present and similarly accumulate in different organs (leaves, roots and flowers). However, there exists a number of hcn-midi RNAs which display organ-specific differences in accumulation levels.. Fig.4The relative levels of hcn-midi RNA accumulation in Arabidopsis leaves, roots and flowers. Changes in the hcn-midi RNA accumulation levels: a roots versus leaves. (b) flowers versus leaves. The range of changes considered to be insignificant (lower than twofold) is marked with a gray box. Each spot is represented by a separate diamond symbol (spots 1-70 are arranged consecutively from left to right). In order to determine the fold changes of hcn-midi RNA accumulation levels, the relative spot counts obtained for roots or flowers were divided by corresponding relative spot counts obtained for leaves. Spots that displayed significantly higher relative intensity in leaf profile are colored green (a, b). Spots that displayed significantly higher relative intensity in flower profile (b) are colored blue. No spots that exhibited significantly higher relative intensity in root profile were detected (a). We also attempted to determine if the RNAi machinery is involved in the generation of hcn-midi RNAs. Therefore, we examined whether the biogenesis of these molecules is dependent on the presence of Dicer-like (DCL) ribonucleases. We performed 2D-PAGE analyses of RNA samples that were isolated from rosette leaves of four Arabidopsis mutants, each lacking one of the DCLs. Earlier, it was shown that these mutants display an aberrant accumulation of miRNAs, siRNAs and tasiRNAs because of defects in small RNA biogenesis pathways (Chapman and Carrington 2007). In addition, mutants devoid of DCL1 or DCL4 exhibit complex developmental defects (Xie et al. 2005; Schauer et al. 2002). Comparison of the hcn-midi RNAs of DCL mutants (dcl1-5, dcl2-1, dcl3-1 and dcl4-2) and wild type plants (Fig.5, Online Fig.4) revealed the following numbers of significantly differentiating degradants: 6 for dcl1-5 (Fig.5a), 3 for dcl2-1 (Fig.5b), 6 for dcl3-1 (Fig.5c) and 2 for dcl4-2 (Fig.5d). In case of dcl1-5, the majority (5) of these degradants displayed higher level of accumulation in mutant leaves than in wild type. Interestingly, in case of other analyzed mutants, all but one differentiating hcn-midi RNAs were less abundant than in wild type leaves. The only exception was one degradant more prevalent in dcl3-1 than in wild type. Moreover, although only a limited number of changes reached the threshold of significance, it was evident that in dcl2-1, dcl3-1 and dcl4-2 the majority of hcn-midi RNAs accumulated to lower levels than in wild type.. Fig.5The relative levels of hcn-midi RNA accumulation in wild type and mutant Arabidopsis leaves. Changes in the hcn-midi RNA accumulation levels: dcl1-5 versus wild type (a); dcl2-1 versus wild type (b); dcl3-1 versus wild type (c); dcl4-2 versus wild type (d). The range of changes considered to be insignificant (lower than twofold) is marked with a gray box. Each spot is represented by a separate diamond symbol (spots 1 to 70 are arranged consecutively from left to right). In order to determine the fold changes of hcn-midi RNA accumulation levels, the relative spot counts obtained for mutant leaves were divided by corresponding relative spot counts obtained for wild type leaves. Spots that displayed significantly higher relative intensity in wild type leaf profile are colored green (a-d). Spots that displayed significantly higher relative intensity in dcl1-5 and dcl3-1 are colored blue (a, c, respectively). No spots that exhibited significantly higher relative intensity in dcl2-1 and dcl4-2 profiles were detected (b, d, respectively). Until now, the accumulation of RNA degradants had mostly been studied in the context of stress-induced effects (Thompson et al. 2008; Haiser et al. 2008; Lee and Collins 2005; Li et al. 2008; Emara et al. 2010; Garcia-Silva et al. 2010). Therefore, we decided to test whether the accumulation pattern of hcn-midi RNAs may be influenced by abiotic stress. RNA samples, which were extracted from Arabidopsis rosette leaves and collected after a 6-h exposure to high salinity (150mM NaCl), were subjected to standard 2D-PAGE analysis. The resultant autoradiograms were compared with those that were obtained earlier for unstressed rosette leaves (Fig.6, Online Fig.5). The undertaken analysis revealed 10 significantly differentiating degradants. Interestingly, almost all of stress-induced changes (9) were associated with a decrease in the level of hcn-midi RNA accumulation.. Fig.6The relative levels of hcn-midi RNA accumulation in leaves of Arabidopsis exposed to salt stress and grown under standard conditions. The range of changes considered to be insignificant (change lower than twofold) is marked with a gray box. Each spot is represented by a separate diamond symbol (spots 1-70 are arranged consecutively from left to right). In order to determine the fold changes of hcn-midi RNA accumulation levels, the relative spot counts obtained for salinity-exposed leaves were divided by corresponding relative spot counts obtained for control leaves. Spots that displayed significantly higher relative intensity in control leaf profile are colored green, whereas a single spot that displayed significantly higher relative intensity in stressed leaf profile is colored blue.
PMC5181575	Results. . ABA promotes FT expression through CO. Mutants of aba1-6 were later flowering compared with the wild type under LDs (Fig. 1A-C). We confirmed a similar late flowering phenotype in aba2-1 mutants, defective in the final steps of ABA biosynthesis (Finkelstein, 2013). Soil applications of ABA could accelerate flowering in wild-type plants, reminiscent of DE response (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1) (Koops et al., 2011). Using this experimental set-up, we could also largely rescue the late flowering of aba1-6 and aba2-1 mutants, indicating a role for ABA as an activator of flowering (Fig. 1A, B).. We have previously demonstrated that ABA activates flowering under LDs but not SDs and that ABA affects photoperiodic signalling upstream of FT expression (Riboni et al., 2013). To understand how ABA interacts with photoperiod signalling to affect flowering, we generated combinations of ABA-deficient (aba1-6) and photoperiodic pathway mutants (Fig. 1C, D; Supplementary Table S1). Consistent with lack of flowering defects of aba1-6 under SDs (Riboni et al., 2013), double mutants of gi-2 aba1-6 displayed a similar flowering time compared with gi-2 single mutants under LDs (Fig. 1C, F). Since double mutants of ft-10 aba1-6 were later flowering than ft-10 single mutants, ABA could affect flowering time via other florigen genes, namely TSF (Fig. 1C, F). The tsf-1 ft-10 aba1-6 triple mutants were slightly later flowering than tsf-1 ft-10 double mutants (Fig. 1C, F). TSF thus contributes to the late flowering phenotype of ft-10 aba1-6 plants although ABA also appears to have an effect on other floral pathways, independent of FT and TSF. Interestingly, double mutants of co-10 aba1-6 were similar to co-10 single mutants, indicating that CO is also required for the late flowering phenotype of aba1-6 mutants (Fig. 1D).. Unlike gi, co mutants generate a DE response, indicating that high levels of ABA accumulation, as a result of drought stress, may eventually overcome CO function to activate flowering (Riboni et al., 2013). To test whether drought could activate the florigen genes in the absence of a functional CO protein we grew wild-type and co-10 mutant plants under control or water stress conditions in SDs before shifting to LDs to induce a photoperiodic response. As expected, in wild-type plants FT expression was strongly up-regulated during the photo-extension period and even further increased under low watering conditions (Fig. 2A). In the co-10 mutants, the levels of FT transcripts were barely detectable at any time point, independent of the watering regime, indicating that drought stress cannot cause FT up-regulation in the absence of a functional CO (Fig. 2B). The pattern of accumulation of TSF showed diurnal oscillations similar to those of FT in wild-type plants, peaking at dusk during the photo-extension period (Fig. 2A, B). Similar to FT, TSF expression was increased in coincidence with the photo-extension period under drought conditions. Furthermore in co-10 mutants, TSF levels were much lower compared with the wild type under normal watering conditions, confirming a role for CO in TSF transcriptional activation (Yamaguchi et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2009). Surprisingly, drought stress caused TSF up-regulation in the co-10 background, partially resuming its diurnal cycle with peaks at ZT8 under the SD part of the experiment and at ZT15 following a photo-extension. Slightly increased TSF levels were observed during SDs under drought conditions (on average 3.8  1.6-fold) but this was not correlated with a DE phenotype under SDs in co-10 mutants (Fig. 2B, D). Thus, unlike FT, TSF can be up-regulated under drought conditions in a CO-independent manner.. . Fig. 2.. . CO is required for the activation of FT under drought stress. (A-C) Real-time qPCR of CO, FT, and TSF transcripts in 3-week-old wild-type (Col-0) (A), co-10, (B) and hab1-1 abi1-2 pp2ca-1 (C) seedlings.

At each time point, values represent fold change variations of CO, FT, and TSF transcript levels relative to Col-0 under NW.

GI is required for DE downstream of CO transcriptional activation. Our experiments indicate that ABA promotes FT transcript accumulation through CO. However, CO transcript levels are not greatly affected by drought stress or when ABA level are reduced (Han et al., 2013; Riboni et al., 2014). Here we wanted to test whether drought could affect flowering downstream of CO transcriptional activation events, by analysing mutants of cdf1-R cdf2-1 cdf3-1 cdf5-1, hereafter referred to as cdf1235, characterized by constitutively elevated CO levels (Fornara et al., 2009). The cdf1235 mutants flowered early and produced a DE response quantitatively similar to that of the wild type under LDs (Fig. 3A). Despite their early flowering phenotype under SDs, cdf1235 plants did not produce any DE response (Fig. 3B), suggesting a requirement for LDs in DE response, even when CO levels are elevated (Fornara et al., 2009) (Fig. 3C). We therefore compared the flowering time and DE response of the quadruple cdf1235 mutant with that of gi cdf1235 quintuple mutants under LDs (Fig. 3A). As previously shown, mutants of cdf1235 are slightly earlier flowering than gi cdf1235 under normal watering conditions (Fornara et al., 2009). However, while the cdf1235 mutants produced a DE response, the gi cdf1235 did not (Fig. 3A). We next sought to ascertain if the lack of DE response in the gi cdf1235 mutants was correlated with impaired transcriptional up-regulation of the florigen genes under drought stress. Control and water-stressed wild-type, cdf1235 and gi cdf1235 plants were grown under SD conditions for 2 weeks before shifting to LDs, and transcript levels were analysed at ZT8 (corresponding to dusk in the SDs) and ZT12 (4 h after the photo-extension) (Fig. 3C-E). As expected, the levels of CO transcript were generally higher in cdf1235 and gi cdf1235 mutants as compared with the wild type. Under drought conditions, we observed a small increase in CO transcript abundance in all the genotypes analysed at any time point, suggesting a contribution of drought stress in CO transcript accumulation (Fig. 3C). We finally determined how different patterns of CO transcript were correlated with accumulation of florigen genes (Fig. 3D, E). Under well-watered conditions, mutants of cdf1235 showed the largest FT and TSF transcript accumulations before and after the photo-extension period. Mutants of gi cdf1235 displayed levels of FT and TSF intermediate between the wild type and the cdf1235 mutants. This is probably as a result of residual CDF-mediated repression in cdf1235 on both CO and FT promoters (Fornara et al., 2009; Song et al., 2012). However, while both the wild type and the cdf1235 mutants showed a significant and similar up-regulation of FT and TSF under drought stress conditions at ZT12 (2- to 4-fold, respectively), no such up-regulation occurred in the gi cdf1235 mutants (Fig. 3D, E).. .

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . In a complementary approach, we asked whether ABA production might be required for FT transcriptional activation when GI levels are increased. Mutants of early flowering 3 (elf3) are extremely early flowering, accumulate high levels of FT, and present increased accumulation of GI transcript and GI protein (Fowler et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2008). This early flowering phenotype requires ABA since elf3-1 aba1-6 double mutants were significantly later flowering compared with elf3-1 single mutants (Fig. 3F, G). FT and TSF transcript levels were slightly but not significantly reduced in aba1-6 mutants compared with the wild type at this early developmental stage (Fig. 3J, K; Supplementary Table S2). However, double mutants of elf3-1 aba1-6 had a significant reduction in both FT and TSF levels compared with the elf3-1 single mutants (Fig. 3J, K; Supplementary Table S2). The reduced levels of FT and TSF in elf3-1 aba1-6 compared with elf3-1 mutants were not caused by diminished GI or CO transcript accumulations (Fig. 3H, I; Supplementary Table S2), indicating that ABA might be required for the activation of GI and CO signalling.. . . ABA signalling genes control FT transcript accumulation with little effect on CO. We analysed ABA-hypersensitive mutants plants hab1-1 abi1-2 pp2ca-1, impaired in three ABA-related PP2C phosphate genes, under different watering and photoperiodic conditions (Rubio et al., 2009). Consistent with previous observations, mutants of hab1-1 abi1-2 pp2ca-1 had much increased (up to 6-fold) levels of FT compared with the wild type under LDs (Riboni et al., 2013) (Fig. 2C). The experiment in Fig. 2C also shows that FT expression was even further activated under drought conditions compared with the wild type (up to 13.3-fold). In contrast, TSF expression was not clearly increased in hab1-1 abi1-2 pp2ca-1 plants compared with the wild type under any watering condition. No FT or TSF up-regulation occurred under SDs in the hab1-1 abi1-2 pp2ca-1 mutants under any watering condition.. Under control conditions the strong up-regulation of FT in hab1-1 abi1-2 pp2ca-1 plants was not caused by increased CO levels, which were comparable with those observed in the wild type (Fig. 2C). Increased levels of CO were, however, observed in the hab1-1 abi1-2 pp2ca-1 mutants under drought stress, indicating that high levels of ABA signalling can ultimately induce the transcriptional activation of CO (Koops et al., 2011; Yoshida et al., 2014).. To explore further the role of ABA signalling in the transcriptional control of FT, we analysed abi1-1 mutant plants (Ler background), carrying a dominant mutation in the PP2C phosphatase ABI1 (Koornneef et al., 1984) which results in severely reduced ABA responses. abi1-1 mutant plants did not show flowering defects under LDs, but exhibited an early flowering phenotype under SDs, consistent with previous observations (Martnez-Zapater et al., 1994; Chandler et al., 2000) (Fig. 4A, B). Ruling out an ecotype-specific effect for ABA action in flowering, the ABA biosynthetic mutants aba1-1 and aba1-3 (Ler background) showed a marginal late flowering phenotype compared with the wild type under LDs (ANOVA P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively), but no defects under SDs (Fig. 4A, B). The late flowering phenotype of these aba1 mutants was more pronounced under drought conditions and LDs, indicative of a reduced DE response (Fig. 4A). Mutants of abi1-1 were even more impaired in the DE response compared with the aba1 alleles, producing on average 14  2% more leaves (n = 8 independent experiments, 15 plants each), relative to the untreated control.. .

(A and B) Mean number of rosette leaves of the wild type (Ler) and ABA-deficient or signalling mutants grown under LDs and subject to normal watering (NW; black bars) or low watering (LW; grey bars) regimes (A), or under SDs in NW regime (B).

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . We next analysed the pattern of accumulation of the florigen genes in abi1-1 plants. As expected, in wild-type plants, the accumulation of FT was strongly induced under drought conditions in a photoperiod-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). TSF expression was instead down-regulated under drought conditions in the Ler background, revealing an ecotype-specific effect for TSF regulation under drought (Fig. 5A). Lower levels of FT and TSF were observed in the aba1-1 mutants compared with the wild type under both normal watering (TSF) and drought conditions (FT and TSF), confirming the contribution of ABA in both FT and TSF regulation (Fig. 5B) (Riboni et al., 2013). Strikingly, in abi1-1 plants the levels of FT were dramatically reduced compared not only with the wild type but also with aba1-1 plants, under any watering condition analysed (Fig. 5C). Such low expression of the florigen genes did not depend on reduced CO transcript accumulation in abi1-1 which was, if anything, up-regulated (Fig. 5C). Taken together, our data point to a model where ABA affects accumulation of florigen genes without an effect on CO expression.. . Fig. 5.. . ABA activates GI signalling and florigen expression with little effect on CO transcript accumulation. (A-E) Real-time qPCR of CO, FT, and TSF transcripts in 2-week-old wild-type (Ler) (A), aba1-1 (B), abi1-1 (C), 35S::GI (D), and 35S::GI abi1-1 (E) seedlings.

Scale bar=1 cm. (H) Higher magnification of LW 35S::GI and 35S::GI abi1-1 plants shown in (G). Note the appearance of a bolt in 35S::GI but not in 35S::GI abi1-1.. . . . Loss of PP2C function (as in hab1-1 abi1-2 pp2ca-1) results in increased FT transcript accumulation, while expression of a gain-of-function form of ABI1 (as in abi1-1) leads to reduced FT activation. To determine whether the negative regulation of ABI1 on FT expression could be exerted in the cells expressing FT, we fused a 2.2 kb promoter region of ABI1 to the GUS reporter. We detected GUS staining in several independent transgenic T2 plants (n = 6) with comparable results, at ZT8, where ABI1 transcript accumulation is highly abundant according to a publicly available data set (http://diurnal.mocklerlab.org; Mockler et al., 2007). For comparison, we also studied the pattern of GUS activity in Arabidopsis transgenic lines marking the FT expression domain; the ABA2 (Lin et al., 2006; Kuromori et al., 2014) and the FT promoter itself (Notaguchi et al., 2008). Histochemical detection in young seedlings revealed that ABI1 expression (Fig. 4E) occurred in the vasculature of cotyledons in a pattern similar to ABA2 and FT (Fig. 4C, D), demonstrating an overlap between ABA biosynthesis and signalling genes in the tissue known to be the source of FT protein production. Broadly distributed GUS staining was also observed in the apical region of ABI1::GUS transgenic plants (Fig. 4H). This pattern of expression may also indicate a role for ABA signalling in the shoot apex.. . . Impaired ABA signalling negatively affects GI action. Whether impairing ABA signalling affects GI action was tested by generating abi1-1 35S::GI plants. As previously observed, 35S::GI plants had increased levels of FT under both SDs and LDs compared with the wild type (Mizoguchi et al., 2005). Under drought conditions, FT expression was generally less responsive to drought in the 35S::GI background compared with the wild type (Fig. 5D). The levels of TSF were much more increased in 35S::GI plants compared with the wild type during the SD part of the experiment. However, no further up-regulation of TSF occurred as a result of drought stress compared with normal watering (Fig. 5D). The overaccumulation of FT observed in 35S::GI plants was strongly rescued in the abi1-1 35S::GI mutants under any watering conditions (Fig. 5E). The levels of TSF transcript fell even more severely in abi1-1 35S::GI plants compared with 35S::GI. Such reductions in florigen accumulation in abi1-1 35S::GI plants were not related to decreased CO levels as these were much higher than in the wild type (Fig. 5A, E). Interestingly the levels of CO in abi1-1 35S::GI plants were only mildly reduced compared with 35S::GI, which could suggest that the negative role exerted by abi1-1 protein on GI signalling is more related to FT and TSF regulation rather than to CO (Fig. 5D, E).. Our data describe a regulatory role of ABA in GI signalling. Such ABA-mediated post-transcriptional activation of GI is consistent with previous observations on 35S::GI plants showing a DE-responsive phenotype under SDs (Riboni et al., 2013). In contrast, no DE response occurred in abi1-1 35S::GI mutants, which flowered much later compared with well-watered plants of the same genotype, although still earlier than abi1-1 plants (Fig. 5F). Under normal watering conditions, double mutants of abi1-1 35S::GI had a similar flowering phenotype to 35S::GI plants, despite showing reduced accumulation of the florigen genes (Fig. 5E, F). A similar observation could be made for abi1-1 plants, which did not show flowering defects under LDs compared with the wild type, but had reduced florigen expression (Fig. 5A, C). We conclude that late flowering of abi1-1 or abi1-1 35S::GI plants under drought stress cannot be solely ascribed to reduced florigen up-regulation.. . . A negative role for ABA signalling in flowering. The early flowering of abi1-1 plants under SDs (Fig. 4B) implies that ABA signalling also exerts a negative role in flowering, which is usually undetectable under LDs or in ABA biosynthetic mutants (Fig. 4A). Supporting this model, we have previously reported a delay of flowering time under SDs in mutants of hab1-1 abi1-2 pp2ca-1 and observed a similar phenotype also in hab1-1 abi1-2 abi2-2 plants (Riboni et al., 2013) (Supplementary Fig. S2). abi1-1 mutants showed no increase in FT and TSF levels under SDs (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the accumulation of another floral integrator, SOC1, was increased in abi1-1 plants as compared with the wild type under any photoperiodic condition (Fig. 6A). Mutants of abi1-1 also had strongly reduced levels of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) (Fig. 6B), a transcriptional repressor of SOC1 which contributes to delaying flowering under drought condition (Riboni et al., 2013; Y. Wang et al., 2013; Shu et al., 2016). Since SOC1 integrates different floral pathways in the SAM (Moon et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2009; Song et al., 2012, 2014) which promote flowering under SDs we created the abi1-1 soc1-1 double mutants. Under SDs, these plants displayed a flowering time similar to the soc1-1 single mutants. With respect to flowering time, soc1-1 is thus completely epistatic to abi1-1, indicating that SOC1 activity is required for the early flowering of abi1-1 mutants under SDs (Fig. 6C).. . Fig. 6.. . The inhibitory role of ABA in flowering requires SOC1. (A and B) Real-time qPCR of SOC1 (A) and FLC (B) transcripts in 2-week-old wild-type (Ler) and abi1-1 seedlings.

A representative experiment of two biological replicates is shown. (C and D) Mean number of rosette leaves of the wild type (Ler) and mutants grown under SDs (C) or LDs (D).

(E) Model summarizing the proposed modes of ABA action in flowering. In the leaves, under LDs, drought promotes ABA accumulation leading to enhanced GI signalling and activation of florigen genes. CO protein is required for FT up-regulation, but not TSF. At the same time, at the shoot apex ABA represses flowering, downplaying SOC1 signalling, independent of photoperiodic conditions.. . . . Under LDs, abi1-1 soc1-1 double mutants were later flowering than soc1-1 single mutants (Fig. 6D). Thus, the knocking out of SOC1 produces a novel flowering phenotype in the abi1-1 background, consistent with ABA being able to affect flowering differentially in different domains of the plant; by promoting FT expression in the leaves and negatively regulating floral stimuli in the SAM (Fig. 6E)..
PMC2803217	Results. . Cloning of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cDNAs. In silico analyses of the Arabidopsis genome revealed five open reading frames (ORFs) for transporters with significant homology to the previously characterized Arabidopsis plasma membrane polyol transporter AtPMT5 (At3g18830; Klepek et al., 2005). Two of these genes, AtPMT1 (At2g16120) and AtPMT2 (At2g16130), are located on chromosome 2 with their start ATGs being separated by 6881 nucleotides. Both genes are interrupted by 2 introns, and in both genes these introns are inserted at identical positions (after nucleotides 127 and 474 of the open reading frame) yielding exons that encode identical numbers of amino acids (Fig. 1). The first of these two introns is conserved in all AtPMT genes, the second only in AtPMT1, AtPMT2, and AtPMT5. The high degree of similarity in the coding regions of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 (93.6% identity on the amino acid level) is conserved also within their intron sequences that are 83.3% (1st intron; 91 bp in AtPMT1 and 94 bp in AtPMT2) and 68.7% identical (2nd intron; 88 bp in AtPMT1 and 92 bp in AtPMT2). Moreover, the first 500 nucleotides of the 5-flanking sequences share 76.60% identity. Together, these data suggest that AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 are the result of a gene duplication in the recent history of Arabidopsis evolution. As a result of this high degree of sequence similarity, microarrays do not discriminate between AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 expression. They do show, however, that AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 are the PMT genes with the lowest expression levels in Arabidopsis (https://www.genevestigator.com/).. . Fig. 1.. . Comparison of the six Arabidopsis PMT proteins. Schematic alignment of the deduced protein sequences (black bars) of AtPMT1 to AtPMT6 based on the intron positions (arrows) in the respective genes. Grey vertical bars (I-XII) indicate the positions of the predicted transmembrane helices, thin lines show two small gaps in the AtPMT4 sequence. Numbers of amino acids encoded by the different exons are indicated (white).. . . . AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cDNAs were obtained from whole-plant RNA preparations by RT-PCR. The resulting protein sequences (both 511 amino acids) confirmed predicted protein sequences (GenBank accessions: AtPMT1=NP 179209 and AAD26954; AtPMT2=NP 179210 and AAD26955). The proteins have similar molecular masses and isoelectric points (AtPMT1: 54.76 kDa, isoelectric point=9.72; AtPMT2: 54.93 kDa, isoelectric point=10.12), and these values are in the same range as those of three other AtPMTs (AtPMT3: 54.81 kDa, isoelectric point=10.16; AtPMT5: 58.10 kDa, isoelectric point=10.39; AtPMT6: 52.92 kDa, isoelectric point=9.85).. . . Expression of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cDNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To determine the functional properties of the two transporters, their cDNAs were cloned into the unique NotI site of the yeast expression vector NEV-N (Sauer and Stolz, 1994). Constructs harbouring the cDNAs in sense or antisense orientation [pMV-Y (AtPMT1 sense), pMV-Y-as (AtPMT1 antisense), pYK34 (AtPMT2 sense) and pYK35 (AtPMT2 antisense)] were used to transform yeast strain EBY.VW-4000 (Wieczorke et al., 1999) that has no background of monosaccharide transporter activity. The resulting strains were named VMY15 (AtPMT1 sense), VMY21 (AtPMT1 antisense), YKY6 (AtPMT2 sense), and YKY7 (AtPMT2 antisense).. In a first approach, VMY15 and YKY6 cells were used for competition analyses. To this end, the transport of 14C-sorbitol was tested first, and as sorbitol was transported by both cell lines, the uptake rates for 14C-sorbitol (0.1 mM) in the presence of several potential competitors, all at a 100-fold molar excess (=10 mM; Fig. 2A) were determined. In both strains, uptake of sorbitol was strongly reduced in the presence of xylitol, several pentoses, inositol, erythritol, inositol, and unlabelled sorbitol, with xylitol being the best competitor in both cases. Fructose was also an excellent competitor of AtPMT1-driven sorbitol uptake; mannitol and several other compounds were only poor or no competitors. This result suggested that, like AtPMT5 and PMT-type transporters from polyol-translocating species, AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 are broad-spectrum sugar/polyol transporters with a preference for xylitol and fructose.. . Fig. 2.. . Functional characterization of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 in the monosaccharide transport-deficient yeast strain EBY.VW-4000. (A) AtPMT1-driven (top; strain VMY15) or AtPMT2-driven (bottom; strain YKY6) uptake of 14C-sorbitol (0.1 mM) into transgenic baker's yeast in the presence of different potential competitors that were added at a 100-fold molar excess (n=3; SD). (B) Transport of the indicated compounds into AtPMT1-expressing yeast strain VMY15 (open symbols) and into the strain VMY21, that expresses the AtPMT1 cDNA in antisense orientation (closed symbols; n=3; SD). (C) Transport of the indicated compounds into AtPMT2-expressing yeast strain YKY6 (open symbols) and into the strain YKY7, that expresses the AtPMT2 cDNA in antisense orientation (closed symbols; n=3; SD). (D) pH-dependence (left) and sensitivity to the uncoupler CCCP (right) of AtPMT1 (VMY15) and AtPMT2 (YKY6; n=3; SD).. . . . Direct transport assays were performed next with a selected set of radiolabelled substrates, including sorbitol, glucose, galactose, fructose, xylose, and xylitol (Fig. 2B, C), ribose and inositol (not shown). All transport tests were performed at an initial substrate concentration of 0.1 mM. Although the maximal transport rates determined for AtPMT2 in YKY6 cells (Fig. 2C) were about 50% lower than those of AtPMT1 in VMY15 cells (Fig. 2B), the relative transport rates were quite similar for both transporters. The relative permeability sequence (xylitol>fructose>sorbitol or glucose>ribose>inositol>xylose>galactose) demonstrated that xylitol and fructose represented the preferred substrates of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. Uptake of the different substrates was also studied in the antisense yeast strains VMY21 and YKY7 (antisense controls are better than untransformed yeast cells, as they carry the same gene defect. Antisense controls are better than empty vector controls as the multicopy sense and antisense plasmids have identical sizes, which excludes that differences result from plasmid copy numbers). The rates determined in these strains were negligible (Fig. 2B, C).. pH-dependence and uncoupler-sensitivity of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 appeared similar. Transport rates increased with decreasing pH-values, but the pH-dependence was steeper for AtPMT1 than for AtPMT2 (Fig. 2D). In agreement with this, a strong sensitivity to carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an uncoupler of proton gradients, was found for both transporters. The CCCP effect on AtPMT1 was more pronounced than on AtPMT2 (Fig. 2D). Both sets of experiments suggested that AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 function as H+-symporters.. When determining the Km-values of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 for their putatively best substrate xylitol, almost identical affinities were obtained, with 0.140.02 for AtPMT1 and 0.180.01 for AtPMT2 (Fig. 3). In addition, the Km of AtPMT1 was determined for sorbitol [0.770.12 mM (graph not shown)] and the Km of AtPMT2 was determined for glucose [1.250.4 mM (graph not shown)]. These results confirm that xylitol is the best substrate of both transporters.. . Fig. 3.. . Determination of the Km-values for xylitol for AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics for xylitol uptake were determined (A) in AtPMT1-expressing (strain VMY15) and (B) AtPMT2-expressing (strain YKY6) yeast cells. Inserts show Lineweaver-Burke plots of the same data sets (SD; n=3).. . . . . . Expression of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cDNAs in X. laevis oocytes. Xenopus laevis oocytes had been used for the successful expression of cRNA of the plasma membrane H+-symporter AtPMT5 (Klepek et al., 2005; Reinders et al., 2005) and of several other H+-symporters (Aoshima et al., 1993; Schneider et al., 2006, 2007). Therefore, this system was used to analyse the putatively electrogenic transport mechanisms of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. Following the injection of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cRNAs into Xenopus oocytes, xylitol-dependent ion currents were monitored. These currents were not affected by K+, Na+ or N-methylglucamine (NMG+) ions in the bath medium (Fig. 4A, C) pointing to protons as the symported ion species. No xylitol-induced currents were detected in water-injected controls (not shown).. . Fig. 4.. . Characterization of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. (A) AtPMT1-expressing oocytes mediate H+-inward currents in response to xylitol (10 mM) application. The presence of KCl and NaCl (left) or of N-methylglucamine chloride (NMGCl; right) in the external bath solution did not effect the characteristics of xylitol-induced currents. Measurements were recorded at a membrane potential of -60 mV and pH 6.5 (one of nine experiments with identical results). (B) H+-currents elicited by xylitol (10 mM) were recorded at the indicated membrane potentials. The external solution contained 30 mM KCl and 65 mM NaCl and was adjusted to pH 6.5 (one of four experiments with identical results). (C) Experimental design as in (A) but with AtPMT2-expressing oocytes (one of eight experiments with identical results). (D) Same conditions as in (B) but with AtPMT2-expressing oocytes (one of five experiments with identical results).. . . . Currents induced by the polyol appeared strongly voltage-dependent. Steps in membrane potentials from 0 mV to -40 mV and -90 mV (Fig. 4B, D) elicited gradually increasing inward currents. Thereby, membrane hyperpolarization increased the electrochemical force for protons to enter the transporter and together with the polyol released the co-transported solutes into the cytoplasm. Together these data demonstrate that AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 catalyse the electrogenic, voltage-dependent symport of protons with xylitol.. . . Transient expression of AtPMT1-GFP and AtPMT2-GFP fusion-constructs. Although the transport activities of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 in yeast and Xenopus plasma membranes (Figs 2, 3, 4) provided indirect evidence that these proteins might be transporters of the plasma membrane, targeting of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 to other membranes in planta cannot be excluded. To identify the subcellular localization of both transporters in Arabidopsis, the open reading frame (ORF) for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was attached to the 3-ends of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 cDNAs and the resulting constructs were used for transient expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts or in intact Arabidopsis epidermal cells. All cells transformed with these constructs (pMV-L for AtPMT1-GFP expression; Fig. 5A, B; pYK26 for AtPMT2-GFP expression; Fig. 5C) showed strong and specific labelling of their cell surfaces. Chloroplasts (recognized by their red autofluorescence) are clearly located inside this labelled structure. This localization supports the plasma membrane as the origin of the signal rather than the tonoplast or the endoplasmic reticulum.. . Fig. 5.. . Subcellular localization of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2.

Bars are 50 mum (A, B), 60 mum (C).. . . . . . Analysis of the tissue-specific expression in AtPMT1 promoter/reporter and AtPMT2 promoter/reporter plants. For each gene two separate reporter gene constructs with the ORFs of GUS (beta-glucuronidase) or GFP were generated. Promoter fragments were obtained from PCR amplifications that introduced HindIII cloning sites at the 5-ends and NcoI cloning sites at the transcriptional start sites. Promoter/reporter cassettes were generated, inserted into pAF16 (Stadler et al., 2005), and used to transform Arabidopsis plants. For each construct (pAtPMT1/GFP; pAtPMT1/GUS; pAtPMT2 /GFP; pAtPMT2/GUS) 20-30 transformants were analysed.. During the analysis of 30 pAtPMT1/GUS plants, GUS staining was found in the hydathodes and in pollen grains germinating on stylar papillae or on agar medium (Fig. 6B, C) in seven plants. No staining was detected in pollen grains inside the anthers (Fig. 6A) or in released but yet ungerminated pollen grains (Fig. 6B, C). One pAtPMT1/GUS plant showed weak staining in the vasculature of its flower stalks. Analysis of embedded cross-sections showed that this staining resulted from very low GUS activity in the cambium and from slightly stronger GUS activity in young xylem cells (Fig. 6D-F).. .

Analysis of 30 pAtPMT2/GUS plants confirmed the already described GFP expression in pollen (Fig. 7A, B). In contrast to the GUS staining observed in pAtPMT1/GUS pollen (Fig. 6B, C), however, this staining (i) was much stronger and (ii) was detected in pollen grains of still closed anthers (Fig. 7B). Moreover, our analyses also revealed GUS activity in hydathodes and (weakly) in minor veins of several plants (Fig. 7D). Finally, one pAtPMT2/GUS plant showed staining in the vasculature of the flower stalks. The latter signal resulted from low GUS activity in the cambium and from stronger GUS activity in young xylem cells (Fig. 7E).. . Fig. 7.. .

(B) Higher magnification of an anther with very strong GUS staining in fully developed pollen grains (arrows) and in germinated and ungerminated pollen on agar medium (insert). Staining of cells in the anther surface results from the diffusion of excess stain out of the pollen grains and can even reach the sepals and petals of stained flowers (see A). (C) GFP-fluorescence (epifluorescence) in pollen grains on an opened anther from a pAtPMT2/GFP plants. No fluorescence is seen in WT anthers (insert).

(E) Cross-section of a flower stalk with GUS staining in young xylem cells (ca, cambium; ph, phloem; xy, xylem). A bar indicates the region where the single-celled row of cambial cells is located. The cambial cells themselves cannot be identified. Bars are 2 mm (A, D), 200 mum (B, insert of C), 20 mum (insert of B), 100 mum (C), 25 mum (E).. . . . While GFP fluorescence could not be detected in any of the pAtPMT1/GFP plants (not shown), 100% of the pAtPMT2/GFP plants showed intense fluorescence in their mature pollen grains (Fig. 7C). This fluorescence was detected only during the late stages of pollen development, i.e. in still closed anthers of just opening flowers. The signal increased further with ongoing anther dehiscence. No other sites of GFP fluorescence were detected. This GFP signal was absent from wild-type (WT) pollen (insert of Fig. 7C).. . . Immunohistochemical analyses of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 localization. The observed expression of AtPMT2 in pollen is supported by data from publicly accessible microarray analyses that show strong expression of AtPMT2 exclusively in mature pollen (stage 12). However, as already mentioned, these microarray data show identical data for AtPMT1, as they do not discriminate between these two almost identical genes (https://www.genevestigator.com/; http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi). Moreover, the data presented do not show expression of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 in any other tissue, which could result from weak promoter activities in only a limited number of cells of a given organ, for example, in young xylem cells of the flower stalk.. To test this possibility and to confirm or confute the GUS stainings observed in flower stalks, antisera were raised against a mixture of two peptides (peptide 1: NH2-KVLDKTSNTKEEAISR-COOH; peptide 2: NH2-SYTANKKNNSMSKDNEV-COOH) predicted to represent immunogenic regions in AtPMT1. These peptides corresponded to the regions 223-238 (central cytoplasmatic loop) and 491-507 (C-terminus) of AtPMT1. The respective regions of AtPMT2 are either identical (peptide 1) or very similar (peptide 2: NH2-YSANKKNNVMSKGKQV-COOH), and resulting antibodies were, therefore, not expected to discriminate between these proteins. Peptides for the production of potentially monospecific antibodies could not be identified.. The quality of the antisera was first tested in AtPMT1-expressing or AtPMT2-expressing yeast cells. Sera from two immunized rabbits (alphaAtPMT1/2-R1 and alphaAtPMT1/2-R2) recognized AtPMT1 in detergent extracts of enriched plasma membranes from yeast cells expressing the AtPMT1 cDNA (Fig. 8A). Most importantly, however, immunolocalizations with sections from yeast cells expressing AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 either in a sense or in an antisense orientation (i) labelled AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 equally well in sense but not in antisense sections, and (ii) labelled the cell surface exclusively, most likely the plasma membranes of these cells (Fig. 8B). This demonstrated that, as expected, the sera do not discriminate between AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. The sera, however, appeared to be suitable to detect these proteins in immunohistochemical analysis of plant tissue.. . Fig. 8.. . Characterization of the alphaAtPMT1/2 antisera in AtPMT1-expressing and AtPMT2-expressing yeast cells. (A) Western-blot (2 mug of protein per lane) of SDS-solubilized, enriched plasma membranes from AtPMT1-expressing yeast cells (s) or from cells expressing the AtPMT1 cDNA in antisense orientation (as). alphaAtPMT1/2 antisera from two rabbits (R1 and R2) were used at dilutions of 1:5000 and yielded prominent signals only in extracts from AtPMT1-expressing (s) cells. (B) Decoration of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 proteins at the cell surfaces of AtPMT1-expressing (AtPMT1-s) or AtPMT2-expressing (AtPMT2-s) yeast cells with alphaAtPMT1/2-R1 (1:1000). An overview with many cells is shown for AtPMT1, a single cell is shown for AtPMT2. No fluorescence was seen in antisense controls (AtPMT1-as and AtPMT2-as). Bars are 50 mum for the AtPMT1 sections and 3 mum for all AtPMT2 sections. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . Based on these results, immunohistochemical analyses of cross-sections from Arabidopsis WT flower stalks were performed with unpurified alphaAtPMT1/2-R1 antiserum. Figure 9A shows that this serum labelled the same cell layers that were stained by the GUS histochemical stainings shown in Fig. 6D-F (pAtPMT1) and in Fig. 7D (pAtPMT2). No fluorescence was detected, when preimmune serum was used for these analyses (Fig. 9B, C). The use of affinity-purified alphaAtPMT1/2-R1 improved the signal intensity, but did not alter the specificity of the labelling (Fig. 9D, E). This confirmed the observed GUS staining that pointed to pAtPMT1 and pAtPMT2 activities in young xylem cells (Figs 6D-F, 7E) although this staining was only seen in a very few transgenic plants.. .

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.). . . . . . Analysis of mutant plants with potentially reduced AtPMT1 and/or AtPMT2 expression levels. In publicly available T-DNA insertion libraries (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress) mutants with T-DNA insertions in an exon or intron of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 could not be found, but four lines (SALK_035269, SALK_035929, GABI_141A06, GABI_204C03) were identified that had insertions in the intergenic region between the AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 start ATGs. In three of these lines, the predicted insertions seemed to be too far upstream from the translational start sites to affect the expression of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2. Therefore, only one mutant (Salk_035269), that was predicted to carry an insertion near the translational start ATG of the AtPMT1 gene, was analysed. Figure 10A demonstrates that the insertion in this Atpmt1-1 mutant was 559 bp upstream from the ATG, a distance that might still be long enough to allow expression of the downstream AtPMT1 coding region. In fact, when the AtPMT1 mRNA levels were compared in three WT and three Atpmt1-1 plants (insert of Fig. 10A) by RT-PCR, similar levels were found in all the plants analysed.. . Fig. 10.. . Characterization of T-DNA and antisense lines. (A) Genomic organization of the Atpmt1-1 mutant allele (SALK_035269) that carries a T-DNA insertion in the 5-flanking region (grey) 559 nucleotides upstream from the start ATG. Arrows show the position of the primers used for the characterization of the mutant. The upper right corner shows RT-PCR analyses with cDNAs from three homozygous Atpmt1-1 plants and from three WT plants. AtPMT1 bands can be amplified from the Atpmt1-1 and from the WT cDNAs. Amplified bands of ACTIN2 (ACT2) are shown as controls. (B) Representative RT-PCR analysis of five independent AtPMT1/2-antisense lines (1-5) and of a WT plant. Transcripts of ACT2, AtPMT1, and AtPMT2 were amplified with gene-specific primers (S, molecular weight standard). Only the AtPMT2 transcript is absent from all AtPMT1/2-antisense lines.. . . . In a second approach, an RNAi construct was used that was designed to reduce AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 mRNA levels simultaneously. This construct carried the region with the highest sequence conservation between AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 (nucleotides 719-1191 in the two ORFs; 96.6% identity) in opposite directions under the control of the 35S promoter. After transformation of Arabidopsis plants with this construct, a large number of independent transgenic lines was identified (pMV-RNAi1 plants). The AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 mRNA levels in these plants were then compared with the corresponding mRNA levels in WT plants. Thereby AtPMT2 expression was found down-regulated or absent from most of these plants, whereas that of AtPMT1 was not affected (Fig. 10B). Therefore, neither the Atpmt1-1 mutant nor the pMV-RNAi1 plants were used for further analyses..
PMC3878228	Results. . Heterologously produced CLV3 fusion protein is active in vitro. For the production of the CLV3 proprotein (without the secretion signal peptide), a construct was made in which tandem aligned Trx and His tags were fused to the N-terminus of CLV3 (named TH-ProCLV3). The construct was transformed to E. coli strain BL21(DE3) to produce the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein with a total molecular mass of 23.8 kD. The TH-ProCLV3 was then purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA agarose column (Figure1A), and quantified by Bradford assay [53] after dialyzed using a 7-kD cut-off dialysis bag.. .

Bar in D=50 mum for D, E, H and I; Bar in F=1 cm for F and G; Bar in J=50 mum for J to M.. . . . In vitro activity assays of the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein in SAMs were performed using clv3-2 and clv1-1 (both in Ler background) mutants of Arabidopsis, as described previously [28]. We observed that the incubation of clv3-2 seedlings with 1 muM TH-ProCLV3 for 8 days led to significant reduced sizes of SAMs (Figure1B, H, and I), while no evident reduction was observed in SAMs of clv1-1 seedlings (Figure1B, D, and E), suggesting that the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein produced in E. coli is active in restricting SAMs in a CLV1-dependent manner.. Similarly, in vitro root assays [17] were performed in Ler and clv2-1 (in Ler background) seedlings. We observed that root growths in Ler seedlings treated with TH-ProCLV3 were inhibited greatly (Figure1C, F, and G), as previously reported in the CLV3 peptide treatment [31], while Ler seedlings grown on media without the fusion protein showed normal root growth (Figure1C, F, and G). In contrast, no evident growth inhibition was observed in clv2-1 seedlings grown on media with TH-ProCLV3 (Figure1C, F, and G). Microscopic examinations revealed that the TH-ProCLV3 treatment resulted in termination of RMs in Ler, but not in clv2-1 (Figure1J-M). These results together suggest that the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein produced in E. coli is active in regulating the sizes of SAMs and RMs.. . . Detection of cleavages in CLV3 fusion protein. To analyze the cleavage of CLV3, we developed a MALDI-Tof MS-based method to profile peptide fragments produced in vitro. Pre-germinated Ler seedlings were inoculated with the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein in a liquid medium, then the media were harvested at different time points and subjected directly to MALDI-Tof MS analyses. The fusion protein inoculated in the same medium without seedlings was used as a control. We observed that the optimal time for analyzing peptide cleavage was 24 hr after the incubation with Ler seedlings, when abundant small peptides with different molecular masses were detected (Additional file 1).. To obtain exact sequences of these fragments, Q-Tof MS/MS analyses were performed in these samples. SEQUEST searches for peptide sequences matching the CLV3 proprotein allowed us to identify over 20 peptides (Figure2). Among them, both the CLV3p12 and the CLV3p13 peptides, the backbones of two candidate forms of mature CLV3 peptides [29,30], were included (Figure2). After alignment of these fragments with the CLV3 proprotein, two most frequently occurring termini, N-terminal Met39 and Arg70, were detected (Figure2), suggesting internal cleavage sites located before Met39 and before Arg70. The cleavage before Arg70 has been previously reported [36], however, the one before Met39 is novel. Since Met39 is located in the non-functional region [28], the cleavage might be not functional relevant.. . Figure 2. . Peptide fragments produced from ProCLV3 after incubations. Matching fragments detected are shown below the ProCLV3 sequence, as identified with Q-Tof MS/MS analyses. The core CLE motif (corresponding to the CLV3 peptide) of CLV3 is shown in blue. The CLV3p12 and CLV3p13 peptides are framed. Two internal cleavage sites, before Met39 and before Arg70, are indicated by arrowheads.. . . . It should be noted that, although peptides with C-terminal His81 and His82 were detected, no peptides with matching N-terminal His82 and Val83 were found. Instead, we detected peptides with variable C-termini. It is plausible that no specific internal cleavage site(s) are present in this region, while carboxypeptidases are involved in processing the C-terminus of the CLV3. Recently, Tamaki et al. showed that an endosome-localized SOL1 carboxypeptidase is responsible for removing the C-terminal Arg residue from the CLE19 proprotein [54]. Since intact Ler seedlings were used in our assay, the C-terminal processing activities detected may come from non-specific extracellular carboxypeptidases instead of SOL1.. . . N-terminal flanking sequence affected the cleavage of CLV3. To examine if residues flanking the N-terminus of the CLV3 peptide are required for internal cleavage, we chemically synthesized the CLV3p12 and peptides with additional 1, 3, 4 or 5 residues, namely L-CLV3p13, EEL-CLV3p15, HEEL-CLV3p16 and LHEEL-CLV3p17. These peptides were inoculated in liquid media with Arabidopsis (Ler) seedlings, and medium samples were harvested at different time points and subjected directly to MALDI-Tof MS analyses. We observed that the optimal time for analyzing the cleavage of these peptides was 3 d after the inoculation, when abundant cleaved fragments were detected (Additional file 2). For CLV3p12 and L-CLV3p13 we observed a gradual removal of residues from both N- and C-termini (Figure3A and B). For EEL-CLV3p15, removal of the C-terminal His residue was observed, but not N-terminal residues (Figure3C). No internal cleavages for CLV3p12, L-CLV3p13 and EEL-CLV3p15 were detected. In contrast, in addition to gradual removal of terminal residues for HEEL-CLV3p16 and LHEEL-CLV3p17, internal cleavages were also observed (Figure3D and E). In particular, for HEEL-CLV3p16, a cleavage before Thr71 was observed, producing an 11-AA peptide that is expected to be non-functional [28], while for LHEEL-CLV3p17, cleavages before Arg70 and Thr71 were detected, producing the functional CLV3p12 and a non-functional 11-AA peptide, respectively (Figure3E). As such, it is possible that the internal cleavage before Arg70 requires at least 5 flanking residues, while exopeptidases are involved in removing residues from both termini.. . Figure 3. .

Spectra of CLV3p12 (A), L-CLV3p13 (B), EEL-CLV3p15 (C), HEEL-CLV3p16 (D), LHEEL-CLV3p17 (E), and LHEEA-CLV3p17 (F) after 3-d incubations with Ler seedlings.

Original peptides, blue arrowheads; CLV3p12, red arrowheads. The Ala substitution in F is in red.. . . . . . CLV3 peptide with five additional N-terminal flanking residues showed similar activity as CLV3p12. To evaluate activities of above-mentioned synthetic peptides with various N-terminal extensions, we performed in vitro root assays using Ler seedlings. The lengths of primary roots were measured after 8-d inoculations with either CLV3p12, L-CLV3p13, EEL-CLV3p15, HEEL-CLV3p16 or LHEEL-CLV3p17 at concentrations of 10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM, or 1 muM (Figure4). The results showed that CLV2p12 was active at the concentration of 10 nM, EEL-CLV3p15 was active at 100 nM, while L-CLV3p13 and HEEL-CLV3p16 were not active even at 1 muM, suggesting that these additional N-terminal Leu, Glu-Glu-Leu or His-Glu-Glu-Leu residues caused severe damages to their activities, Strikingly, LHEEL-CLV3p17 was equally active as CLV3p12, i.e. functional at 10 nM. Together with the effective cleavage observed above, we believe that the additional 5 residues in LHEEL-CLV3p17 lead to effective release of CLV3p12, and hence the equivalent activity as CLV3p12.. .

Aligned sequences of all peptides are shown. The Ala substitution in the LHEEA-CLV3p17 is highlighted in red. Average root lengths with significant differences from the non-treated one (P<0.01 by Students t-test) are marked with asterisks.. . . . . . Leu69 is critical for the cleavage and activity in synthetic peptide. Previous studies suggest that PSK and RALF are produced through the cleavage after a Leu residue by endopeptidases in Arabidopsis[43,44]. To examine if the Leu69 adjacent to the N-terminus of the CLV3 peptide is involved in cleavage, we synthesized an Ala-substituted peptide, LHEEA-CLV3p17, and used MALDI-Tof MS to examine its cleavage after inoculation with seedlings in vitro. Interestingly, although removal of a C-terminal residue was observed, no internal cleavage was detected (Figure3F), suggesting that the Leu69Ala substitution had compromised the internal cleavage in the peptide. We also examined the activity of the LHEEA-CLV3p17 peptide in root assays, and observed that the substitution led to a significantly reduced activity in terminating RMs (Figure4). These results together indicate that the N-terminal flanking Leu69 is critical for the internal cleavage, and subsequently for the activity of the peptide.. . . Leu69 is important for the optimal activity of CLV3 fusion proteins. To evaluate if the Leu69 is also important for the TH-ProCLV3 fusion protein, we performed an Ala substitution to produce a TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala fusion protein in E. coli. The activity of TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala in restricting the size of SAMs was examined in vitro. The results showed that SAMs in TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala-treated clv3-2 seedlings were significantly larger than those treated with TH-ProCLV3 (Figure5B, C, and E). Of course compared to non-treated clv3-2 seedlings (Figure5A) they are still smaller. It is evident that the Leu69Ala substitution in TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala has partially compromised its activity in SAMs.. . Figure 5. . In vitro SAM assays using TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala or TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys.

Error bar= SD of 3 independent biological repeats. The asterisks in E and F indicate significant differences (P<0.01 by Students t-test) between TH-ProCLV3- and TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala-treated clv3-2 seedlings.. . . . The commonly known subtilase recognition site is Lys/Arg-Arg [40]. Although in most CLE members of Arabidopsis the residue located before the conserved Arg of the 12-AA CLE motif is Lys (Additional file 3), for CLV3 the residue is Leu. We examined if a Leu69Lys substitution hampered the activity of the fusion protein. TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys was produced in E. coli and applied to clv3-2 seedlings in vitro. As expected, no significant difference was observed between the sizes of SAMs treated with TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys and those treated with TH-ProCLV3 (Figure5B, D, and E), suggesting that the Leu69Lys substitution did not affect the activity. Additionally, we performed in vitro SAM assays in clv1-1, and observed no significant differences among samples treated with TH-ProCLV3, TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala, TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys, and non-treated ones (Figure5E), implying that the functions of TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala and TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys fusion proteins in SAMs are CLV1-dependent, as the CLV3 peptide [34].. To address if these fusion proteins are able to repress the WUS expression in SAMs, qRT-PCR analyses were performed with cDNAs from shoot apices after treatments with various fusion proteins. As shown in Figure5F, the expression level of WUS in shoot apices of TH-ProCLV3-treated clv3-2 seedlings was reduced to about 10% of those non-treated ones. A similar result was obtained in clv3-2 seedlings treated with TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys (Figure5F), confirming that the Leu69Lys substitution did not impair the activity of the fusion protein. In contrast, the expression level of WUS in the TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala-treated clv3-2 seedlings was only about 50% of the untreated ones (Figure5F). The fact that replacement of Leu69 by Ala, but not by Lys, damaged the activity of CLV3 suggests that, although the Leu69 is not part of the mature CLV3 peptide, it is important for the optimal activity in repressing the WUS expression in SAMs.. . . Leu69 is critical for the cleavage of CLV3 fusion proteins. To examine if the Leu69Ala and Leu69Lys substitutions in fusion proteins, namely TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala and TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys, respectively, led to compromised cleavages, Q-Tof MS/MS analyses were performed on medium samples collected after co-cultivations of these fusion proteins with wildtype seedlings. The TH-ProCLV3Leu69Lys showed a similar peptide profile as seen in the TH-ProCLV3 (Figure2 and Figure6A), producing expected CLV3p12 and CLV3p13, and peptides with a C-terminal Lys69. However, for TH-ProCLV3Leu69Ala, although both the CLV3p12 and CLV3p13 were detected, no peptide fragment with C-terminal Ala69 was detected (Figure6B), suggesting that the Leu69Ala substitution may have compromised the cleavage efficiency of the fusion protein or decreased the stability of peptides produced. These results together indicate that both the Leu-Arg and Lys-Arg junctions can be recognized and cleaved by enzymes released by Arabidopsis seedlings.. . Figure 6. .

To address if the requirement of 5-AA residues in the proper cleavage of CLV3 is generic to other CLE peptides, we synthesized CLE1 peptides with either 0, 1, or 5 N-terminal flanking residues: CLE1p12, M-CLE1p13 and FNESM-CLE1p17, respectively. CLE1 was selected as it complements the clv3-1 mutant phenotype when expressed under the control of CLV3 regulatory elements in transgenic plants [35]. Within the 5-AA N-terminal flanking sequence, only the Glu (E) residue is conserved between CLV3 and CLE1 (Additional file 3). After 3-d incubation with Ler seedlings, gradual trimmings of terminal residues were observed in both CLE1p12 and M-CLE1p13, while an internal cleavage was detected between Met (M) and Arg (R) in FNESM-CLE1p17, releasing CLE1p12 (Additional file 4). This suggested that the 5-AA motif is required for proper cleavage of CLE1. As expected, when in vitro activity assays were performed in clv3-2 seedlings, FNESM-CLE1p17 exhibited a similar activity as the CLE1p12 in restricting the sizes of SAMs, while M-CLE1p13 was about 100-fold less active (Additional file 5)..
PMC3254683	Results. . Identification of genes suppressed by insect OS. Insect feeding by chewing herbivores is a combination of mechanical wounding and contact with OS. It is, however, experimentally difficult to assess the contribution of each factor to gene expression changes. Indeed, in contrast to bacterial pathogens where genes responsible for the secretion of effectors can easily be mutated, generating insects that lack OS, for instance by ablating salivary glands, is technically challenging and does not necessarily remove all OS components (Musser et al., 2006). To identify Arabidopsis genes whose wound-induction might be suppressed by insect OS, a protocol was followed that has been successful in identifying OS-specific responses (Halitschke et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2008). To mimic wounding caused by feeding larvae, small holes were punctured manually in Arabidopsis leaves, whereas, to mimic insect feeding, S. littoralis OS was applied to the holes. We used a microarray containing 22473 Arabidopsis gene-specific tags (Hilson et al., 2004; Allemeersch et al., 2005) and analysed expression changes after wounding or treatment with insect OS. Genes that were significantly induced by wounding were first identified by comparing wounded leaves with untreated leaves (>1.5-fold, Students t test, P <0.05). Then, amongst wound-induced genes, a search was made for genes that were suppressed by OS application. Specifically, these genes were selected if their induction by wounding plus OS treatment was significantly lower than the induction by wounding alone (Students t test, P <0.05).. Overall, 274 genes were found that were significantly induced by wounding after 6 h and 47 genes after 24 h (see Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). According to our criteria, eight genes were suppressed after 6 h of OS treatment and five genes were suppressed after 24 h (Table 1). There are two protease inhibitors (At3g22600, At3g22620) that might interfere with proteases in the insect digestive tract and several cell-wall-associated proteins, including two glycine-rich proteins (At3g20470, At4g18280), an hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (At5g09530), an arabinogalactan protein (At4g09030), and a protein involved in wax biosynthesis (CER2, At4g24510). Finally, the list contains other proteins of diverse function, including a member of the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily B-4 of the ERF/AP2 transcription factor family (At5g61890).. . Table 1.. . Genes suppressed by Spodoptera littoralis oral secretions (OS) Genes induced by wounding after 6 h or 24 h were selected from microarray data (expression ratio >1.5 and P value <0.05, Students t test). Then, genes suppressed by Spodoptera littoralis OS were selected if the expression ratio in response to wounding was significantly larger than the expression ratio in response to OS treatment. Expression ratios (SE) are the average of six (wounding) and three (OS) independent experiments. Genes in bold were selected for further experiments. P values refer to the comparison between wounding and OS treatment (Students t test).. . . . . . . Expression ratio. . . AGI code. Description. Wounding. S. littoralis OS. P value. . . . . .

To confirm that the observed suppression has biological relevance, our data were compared with similar experiments carried out previously in our laboratory. Using a microarray containing c. 7200 Arabidopsis genes, expression changes in response to feeding by Pieris rapae or S. littoralis larvae, and in response to wounding, had been measured (Reymond et al., 2004). Six of the 13 suppressed genes identified in the present study had probes on this microarray. Although the experimental set-up was different, five genes had a significantly weaker induction in response to insect feeding than in response to wounding, providing an independent confirmation of our results (see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online).. . . OS application to wounds enhances insect performance. Our observation that OS application to wounds suppressed the induction of several genes potentially involved in defence suggested that chewing insects have evolved this mechanism to counteract the wound response of the plant. It was therefore tested whether OS treatment might enhance the performance of feeding larvae. Second-instar S. littoralis larvae were placed on Arabidopsis plants that were either intact, wounded, or treated with S. littoralis OS. Every day for three consecutive days, larvae were transferred to freshly treated plants. Larvae gained significantly more weight on intact plants than on wounded plants, confirming that plants activate defence genes in response to wounding. However, larvae grew significantly better on plants treated with OS than on wounded plants, suggesting that the suppression of wound-inducible genes was correlated with a higher insect performance (Fig. 1A).. . Fig. 1.. . Insect OS suppress Arabidopsis defences. (A) Weight gain of S. littoralis larvae feeding on control plants (white bar), wounded plants (black bar), or on plants treated with S. littoralis OS (dark grey bar) was measured after 3 d. Every day, 12 larvae were transferred to freshly treated plants. Values (SE) are the mean of eight independent measurements. Bars with different letters differ at P value <0.05 (Student-Newman-Keuls Method). (B) Weight gain of S. littoralis larvae feeding on wounded plants (black bar) or on plants treated with P. brassicae OS (light grey bar) was measured after 7 d. Values (SE) are the mean of three independent experiments. *P value <0.05 (Students t test).. . . . In a similar experiment, it was tested if OS from one insect reduces plant defences that are effective against another insect. Indeed, freshly hatched S. littoralis gained more weight after feeding for 7 d on plants that had been treated once with P. brassicae OS compared with larvae feeding on plants that had been wounded (Fig. 1B). Thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that insect OS reduce plant defences by interfering with the induction of wound-responsive genes.. . . Kinetics of OS-triggered gene suppression. To characterize the suppression of wound-responsive genes by insect OS further, two genes were selected from the list of suppressed genes (Table 1), an ERF/AP2 transcription factor (At5g61890, ERF/AP2 TF) and a protease inhibitor (At3g22620, PI). To test whether the difference in expression between wounding and S. littoralis OS application was really due to a suppression and not to a delay in gene induction between these two treatments, the effect of OS application was measured from 3 h to 48 h by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). OS from the specialist lepidopteran herbivore P. brassicae was also used in the same experiment. Suppression of ERF/AP2 TF was observed at all time points and was similar for both insect OS, with a marked effect 6 h and 10 h after treatment (Fig. 2A). For PI, suppression by both OS was relatively weak in the first 6 h but was significant from 10 h to 48 h (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that different insect OS suppress wound-induced gene expression in Arabidopsis.. . Fig. 2.. . Kinetics of suppression of wound-responsive genes by insect oral secretions (OS). Expression of ERF/AP2 TF (A) and Protease Inhibitor (B) was monitored for several hours after wounding (black bars), and after treatment with S. littoralis OS (dark grey bars), or P. brassicae OS (light grey bars) by qPCR. Untreated plants were used as controls (white bars). Values (SE) are normalized to the reference gene and each time point is the mean of at least three biological replicates. Statistical differences between wounding and OS treatment are indicated (Students t test, *P value <0.05, **P value <0.01).. . . . . . Suppression of wound-responsive genes is independent of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid pathways. Jasmonic acid (JA) plays a major signalling role in defence against chewing insects in different plant species (McConn et al., 1997; Kessler et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004; Reymond et al., 2004). In N. attenuata, OS from tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta elicits a JA burst that is responsible for the induction of defence genes (Halitschke et al., 2003; Diezel et al., 2009). To test whether ERF/AP2 TF and PI suppression requires a functional JA pathway, an Arabidopsis coi1-1 mutant that is insensitive to JA was used (Xie et al., 1998). OS from S. littoralis and P. brassicae suppressed the wound-induction of ERF/AP2 TF and PI to a similar extent in both wild-type and coi1-1 plants (Fig. 3A), indicating that the suppression of ERF/AP2 TF and PI is JA-independent.. . Fig. 3.. . Suppression of wound-responsive genes is independent of JA and SA pathways. Expression of ERF/AP2 TF and Protease Inhibitor was monitored by qPCR after wounding (black bars), and after treatment with S. littoralis OS (dark grey bars), or P. brassicae OS (light-grey bars) on the jasmonate-insensitive mutant coi1-1 (A) and the SA-deficient mutant sid2-1 (B). Untreated plants were used as controls (white bars). Values (SE) are normalized to the reference gene and are the mean of two biological replicates. Statistical differences between wounding and OS treatment are indicated (Students t test, *P value <0.05, **P value <0.01).. . . . Salicylic acid (SA) is a potent inducer of pathogenesis-related genes and is involved in resistance against biotrophic pathogens (Glazebrook, 2005). Recently, a study found that OS from beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) elicit SA accumulation in N. attenuata and that this might interfere with JA-mediated resistance (Diezel et al., 2009). Similarly, suppression of two defence genes by S. exigua OS was alleviated in Arabidopsis mutants of the SA pathway (Weech et al., 2008). It was therefore tested if suppression of ERF/AP2 TF and PI was affected in the SA-deficient mutant sid2-1 (Nawrath and Metraux, 1999). Again, S. littoralis and P. brassicae OS suppressed the wound-induction of ERF/AP2 TF and PI in both wild-type and sid2-1 plants, suggesting that SA was not required for the suppression of these genes (Fig. 3B).. . . Role of known OS elicitors in suppressing wound-responsive genes. Fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs) are present in the OS of several lepidopteran caterpillars (Pohnert et al., 1999) and modulate the expression of defence genes (Halitschke et al., 2003). The fatty acid moiety originates from plant membranes and is conjugated to either GLN or GLU in the insect midgut (Par et al., 1998). The FACs composition of S. littoralis and P. brassicae OS was analysed by HPLC. Major FACs found in S. littoralis OS were 18:3-GLN and 17-hydroxy-18:3-GLN (volicitin), while 18:2-GLN and 18:2-GLU were present at much lower levels (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). For P. brassicae OS, only a small peak corresponding to 18:3-GLN could be detected. To assess the contribution of 18:3-derived FACs in the suppression of ERF/AP2 TF, caterpillars were fed with Arabidopsis fatty-acid desaturase triple mutant fad3fad7fad8 that lacks 18:3 fatty acids (McConn and Browse, 1996). Consequently, OS from insects feeding on fad3fad7fad8 contained no 18:3-derived FACs, but had increased levels of 18:2-derived FACs (not shown). Suppression of ERF/AP2 TF by OS from insects fed with Col-0 or fad3fad7fad8 plants was similar, indicating that the absence of 18:3-derived FACs did not diminish OS suppressive activity (Fig. 4A). In addition, when purified FACs were applied to wounded leaves, no suppression of ERF/AP2 TF was observed, suggesting that these elicitors are not involved in this phenomenon (Fig. 4B). Similarly, fad3fad7fad8-derived OS also suppressed PI wound-induction whereas purified FACs did not (not shown).. . Fig. 4.. . Role of FACs in the suppression of wound-responsive genes. Expression of ERF/AP2 TF was monitored by qPCR after wounding (black bars), and after treatment with S. littoralis OS (dark grey bars), P. brassicae OS (light grey bars), or FACs (hatched bars) for 10 hr. Untreated plants were used as controls (white bars). (A) Larvae were fed with Col-0 or fad378 mutant plants lacking 18:3. (B) 1, 18:3-GLN; 2, 18:3-GLU; 3, 18:2-GLN; 4, 18:2-GLU. Values (SE) are normalized to the reference gene and are the mean of two biological replicates. Statistical differences between wounding and OS treatment are indicated (Students t test, *P value <0.05, **P value <0.01).. . . . Glucose oxidase (GOX) is found in the saliva of lepidopteran larvae and is involved in the suppression of herbivore-induced resistance in Solanaceous plants and in Medicago truncatula (Musser et al., 2002, 2005; Bede et al., 2006). GOX activity was detected in S. littoralis OS but not in P. brassicae OS (see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online), although both secretions equally suppressed wound-induced gene expression. When purified GOX was applied to wounded Arabidopsis leaves, no suppression of ERF/AP2 TF was observed (see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). In addition, P. brassicae OS that were boiled or filtered through a 3 kDa cut-off filter kept their suppressive activity (see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online), suggesting that it is caused by small non-enzymatic compounds.. Most lepidopteran larvae have an alkaline pH in the midgut. P. brassicae and S. littoralis OS used in our experiments have a pH of 8.5-9.0 and this could affect the expression of defence genes. However, intact P. brassicae OS and P. brassicae OS that were passed through an ion-exchange column and had a pH of 3.5 inhibited ERF/AP2 TF and PI expression to a similar extent, thus excluding that a pH effect was the cause of this suppression (not shown).. . . OS treatment attenuates wound-induced leaf water loss. An analysis of expression profiles of suppressed genes (Table 1) in publicly available microarray databases, carried out with the Genevestigator tool (http://www.genevestigator.com) (Zimmermann et al., 2004), indicated that some of these genes are induced in response to drought. It was therefore reasoned that the suppressive effect of OS might be related to a difference in water loss between wounded and OS-treated leaves. To test this hypothesis, the water loss of detached Arabidopsis leaves, that were either intact, wounded, or treated with OS, was measured. Whereas intact leaves lost only 312% of their initial fresh weight over a period of 6 h, wounded leaves lost 592% of their weight (Fig. 5). Interestingly, leaves treated with OS lost significantly less water than wounded leaves (472%), but still more than intact leaves, indicating that OS application on the wound site was attenuating leaf water loss. This effect was found with both P. brassicae and S. littoralis OS (see Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online).. . Fig. 5.. . Insect OS reduce wound-induced water loss. Leaves were wounded (open squares) or treated with P. brassicae OS (open circles). Untreated plants were used as controls (filled circles). Fresh weight of detached leaves was measured for 6 h. Values (SE) are the mean of 30 leaves and are expressed relative to the initial fresh weight..
PMC2785485	Results. . Overexpression of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 Confers Semi-Dwarf Phenotypes. The SOFL proteins exist in both dicots and monocots [27]. Overexpression of SOB5 in Arabidopsis confers a dwarf phenotype [27].To investigate whether the two Arabidopsis SOFL genes, AtSOFL1 (At1g26210) and AtSOFL2 (At1g68870), have similar functions, each was overexpressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Transgenic plants expressing 35S:AtSOFL1 and 35S:AtSOFL2 showed similar adult phenotypes (Figure 1A-C). The overexpression of either gene generated semi-dwarf plants with reduced apical dominance. Compared with wild-type plants, they had smaller leaves as well as underdeveloped root system and their life cycles were approximately 2 weeks longer (Figure 1A-C, F). These are characteristic phenotypes observed for transgenic plants expressing the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ipt gene, which encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway [28], [29], [30]. Although sob5-D, an activation-tagging mutant overexpressing the SOB5 gene, also shows similar phenotypes [27], there were clear differences between sob5-D and 35S:AtSOFL1, 35S:AtSOFL2 transgenic plants. When the AtSOFL1, AtSOFL2 and SOB5 genes were overexpressed at similar levels, 35S:AtSOFL1, 35S:AtSOFL2 transgenic plants still maintained some degree of apical dominance and were obviously much taller than sob5-D, which almost totally lost its apical dominance (Figure 1A, D) [27]. sob5-D plants have curled-down adult leaves [27], which were rarely observed for 35S:AtSOFL1 and 35S:AtSOFL2 transgenic plants (Figure 1A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0008236.g001.

D, RT-PCR analysis of 35S:AtSOFL-expressing plants. Total RNA was isolated from rosette leaves of seven-week-old Col-0 (D1) and transgenic plants expressing 35S:AtSOFL1 (D2) and 35S:AtSOFL2 (D3). PCR was performed on cDNA using primers specific for the AtSOFL1 or AtSOFL2 gene for 28 or 26 cycles, respectively. The ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) cDNA, amplified for 22 cycles, was used as control to normalize the amount of cDNA in each of the samples. E, Six-day-old Col-0 and transgenic seedlings expressing the 35S:AtSOFL1 or 35S:AtSOFL2 construct as well as Col-0 seedlings grown on medium with 0.1 M benzyladenine (BA) are shown from left to right. F, Six-day-old vertically-grown Col-0 (F1) and transgenic seedlings expressing the 35S:AtSOFL1 (F2) or 35S:AtSOFL2 (F3) construct as well as Col-0 seedlings grown vertically on medium with 0.01 M BA (F4) are shown from left to right. All the seedlings were grown on half-strength MS medium with or without BA. Scale bar =10 mm.. . . . The data presented above suggest that the phenotypic changes of 35S:AtSOFL1 and 35S:AtSOFL2 expressing plants are caused by the increase of endogenous cytokinin levels. To test this hypothesis, we grew 35S:AtSOFL1, 35S:AtSOFL2 and wild-type seedlings on medium with or without cytokinin. The results indicated that the transgenic seedling phenotypes caused by overexpressing AtSOFL1 or AtSOFL2 could largely be phenocopied by supplying wild-type seedlings with exogenous cytokinin (Figure 1E, F). Both transgenic seedlings and cytokinin-treated wild-type controls showed epinastic cotyledons (Figure 1E) and inhibited root development, including shorter main roots and fewer lateral roots (Figure 1F, Table S1).. . . The 35S:AtSOFL1 and 35S:AtSOFL2 Transgenic Plants Have Elevated Endogenous Cytokinin Levels. To investigate whether the endogenous cytokinin levels of 35S:AtSOFL1 and 35S:AtSOFL2 transgenic plants were increased, cytokinin content was measured in the aerial parts and roots of transgenic seedlings overexpressing AtSOFL1 or AtSOFL2. Results from three independent experiments showed that both 35S:AtSOFL1 and 35S:AtSOFL2 transgenic seedlings accumulated higher amounts of trans-zeatin riboside (tZR) in the whole seedling and iPRMP in the aerial tissue. Levels of the cytokinin N-glucosides trans-zeatin 7-glucoside (tZ7G) and cis-zeatin 7-glucoside (cZ7G) were increased mainly in the roots of both 35S:AtSOFL1 and 35S:AtSOFL2 seedlings, whereas the level of N6-(delta2-isopentenyl)adenine 7-glucoside (iP7G) was increased in both aerial and root tissue of transgenic seedlings (Table 1). In these samples, the levels of tZ, cZ, iP, cis-zeatin riboside (cZR) and N6-(delta2-isopentenyl)adenosine (iPR) were below the detection limit. These data suggest that AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 are involved in regulating specific cytokinin levels in Arabidopsis. The 35S:AtSOFL1 and 35S:AtSOFL2 seedlings showed similar, but different altered cytokinin patterns (Table 1), suggesting that the functions of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 are not exactly the same.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0008236.t001.

The SOFL Domains Are Necessary for AtSOFL2's Overexpression Phenotypes. There are two conserved domains, SOFLI and SOFLII, among SOFL proteins. The regions outside the SOFL domains are diverged, especially at C-terminal ends of the proteins. To investigate the function of different SOFL domains, we generated a series of constructs including AtSOFLN, AtSOFLD, AtSOFLCD and AtSOFLC, which expressed different N-terminal or C-terminal regions of AtSOFL2, respectively (Figure 2A, B). All the constructs were expressed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and separately transformed into wild-type Arabidopsis plants. The resulting transgenic plants expressing AtSOFLN, AtSOFLC and AtSOFLCD showed the phenotypes of wild-type plants (Figure 2, B3, B5-B6), suggesting that both SOFLI and SOFLII domains are needed for the overexpression phenotype of AtSOFL2. Transgenic plants expressing AtSOFLD showed similar (Figure 2, B4), but less severe mutant phenotypes compared to the 35S:AtSOFL2 transgenic plants, implying that the C-terminal end of AtSOFL2 is also required for its function.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0008236.g002.

The wildtype (C1), 35S:AtSOFL2 plants (C2) and transgenic plants overexpressing AtSOFL2 gene with point mutations T21I (C3), D80N (C4) and D52N (C5) were grown for one month in the greenhouse. Scale bar =1.5 cm.. . . . To further examine the requirement of some highly conserved residues for AtSOFL2's function, site-directed mutagenesis experiment was performed. A series of site-directed point mutations were generated for the AtSOFL2 gene. Transgenic plants overexpressing the AtSOFL2 gene with mutations in the conserved SOFL domains, T21I and D80N, exhibited wild-type phenotype (Figure 2, C3-C4), suggesting that these conserved amino acid residues are important for AtSOFL2's function. When the less conserved amino acid residue, D52N, was mutated, the transgenic plants overexpressing the mutated gene exhibited mutant phenotypes similar to those observed for 35S:AtSOFL2 transgenic plants (Figure 2, C5), suggesting that this amino acid residue is less important for AtSOFL2's overexpression phenotype.. . . Expression Patterns of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2. The expression patterns of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 in wild-type plants were analyzed via translational fusions with the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were transformed with constructs encoding AtSOFL1-GUS or AtSOFL2-GUS translational fusion proteins that were expressed using the corresponding promoter region of the AtSOFL1 or AtSOFL2 gene. Histochemical analysis of both AtSOFL1:AtSOFL1-GUS and AtSOFL2:AtSOFL2-GUS transgenic plants showed that GUS activity was mainly present in the vascular tissues of leaves, flowers and siliques, but barely detectable in roots and stems (Figure 3). These results are consistent with the expression data for AtSOFL1 in the massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at/) that was constructed by Nakano et al. [31]. No MPSS expression data is available for AtSOFL2.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0008236.g003. Figure 3. . Histochemical localization of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 in Arabidopsis.. Transgenic plants expressing the AtSOFL1:AtSOFL1-GUS (A-F, H-N) or AtSOFL2:AtSOFL2-GUS (G) constructs were grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium for one (L-N) or two weeks (C) or in soil for four (A-B), six (D-J) or eight weeks (K) in the greenhouse.

Scale bar =500 m.. . . . For AtSOFL1:AtSOFL1-GUS-expressing transgenic plants, GUS activity was strong in the midrib of leaf veins of developing leaves, but was relatively weak in the hydathode regions (Figure 3A-C). GUS activity was undetectable in young flower buds, but was present in pistil tips and the vascular tissue of stamens and sepals of developing flower buds (Figure 3D-F). In fully opened flowers, GUS activity was detected in the vascular bundles between the two anther locules, the central vascular cylinders of the filaments, tips and bases of the pistils, and sepal vascular tissue (Figure 3H, I). In pistil tips, GUS activity was stronger in vascular tissues (Figure 3I). GUS activity was also observed at the tips and bases of developing siliques (Figure 3J). When the siliques matured, GUS activity was still present at these positions, but it was restricted to the vascular tissues at the silique tips (Figure 3K).. The expression pattern of AtSOFL1:AtSOFL1-GUS and AtSOFL2:AtSOFL2-GUS was also examined in 6-day-old seedlings. For both AtSOFL1:AtSOFL1-GUS and AtSOFL2:AtSOFL2-GUS, GUS activity was strong in the hydathode region of cotyledons as well as the upper part of hypocotyls and was weak in the vascular tissue of cotyledons. No GUS activity was detected in the roots (Figure 3L-N).. The AtSOFL2:AtSOFL2-GUS translational fusion showed an expression profile similar to that of the AtSOFL1:AtSOFL1-GUS during plant development except that no obvious GUS activity was detected in the anthers and pistil bases of opened AtSOFL2:AtSOFL2-GUS flowers (Figure 3G). Both AtSOFL1:AtSOFL1-GUS and AtSOFL2:AtSOFL2-GUS transgenic plants mainly showed GUS activity in the vascular tissue (Figure 3), suggesting that the function of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 may have some connection with cytokinin transport.. . . Isolation of an Insertion Mutant for AtSOFL2. To study phenotypes conferred by loss-of-function mutations in the SOFL genes, we screened the existing collection of insertion mutants of AtSOFL1 or AtSOFL2. We could not identify any insertions in AtSOFL1, but obtained a mutant (sofl2-1) carrying a T-DNA insertion in the AtSOFL2 open reading frame from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). This mutant is likely to be a null allele because no full-length AtSOFL2 transcript was detected by RT-PCR analysis in RNA samples from sofl2-1 (Figure S1). No obvious mutant phenotype, however, was observed for the sofl2-1 mutant (data not shown), suggesting that there may be functional redundancy between AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2.. . . Silencing of AtSOFL1 Gene in the sofl2-1 Mutant Background. To further investigate the function of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 in Arabidopsis, we generated a RNA interference (RNAi) construct to silence the AtSOFL1 gene in the sofl2-1 mutant background. A 471-bp region of the AtSOFL1 gene containing 3 coding and untranslated region was amplified by PCR and cloned into a binary vector pKANNIBAL in a hairpin manner, resulting in the RNAi construct pRNAi-SOFL1. This construct was first transformed into wild-type Arabidopsis plants. RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression level of AtSOFL1 was dramatically reduced in the T1 transgenic plants, but no reduction was detected for the expression of the AtSOFL2 gene (Figure S2). No obvious mutant phenotype was observed for the resulting SOFL1-RNAi lines (data not shown) and no obvious change was detected for its endogenous cytokinin content (Table S2).. The pRNAi-SOFL1 construct was then transformed into the sofl2-1 mutant and multiple homozygous lines with reduced expression of the AtSOFL1 gene were isolated (Figure 4). Since multiple SOFL1-RNAi sofl2-1 lines showed similar mutant phenotypes (Table S3), we describe below the SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 as a representative line.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0008236.g004. Figure 4. . RT-PCR analysis of SOFL1-RNAi sofl2-1 lines.. Total RNA was isolated from seedlings grown under continuous white light for 5 days. PCR was performed on cDNA by amplifying with AtSOFL1-specific primers for 32 cycles and AtSOFL2-specific primers for 30 cycles. The UBQ10 cDNA, amplified for 22 cycles, was used as control to normalize the amount of cDNA in each of the samples.. . . . . . The SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 Line Has Reduced Endogenous Cytokinin Levels. It has been shown that the overexpression of AtSOFL1 or AtSOFL2 results in higher endogenous cytokinin content (Table 1). To further explore the role of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 in cytokinin metabolism, the content of isoprenoid cytokinins were measured in 7-week-old SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 and wild-type plants. Although the SOFL1-RNAi lines showed no obvious change for their endogenous cytokinin content (Table S2), clear changes were detected for the SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 mutant. Based on three independent experiments, the most significant changes in the SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 mutant was the decreased content of trans-zeatin riboside monophosphate (tZRMP) and iPRMP, which was about 5% and 3% of the wild type content, respectively (Table 2). There was also a slight increase (less than 2.5-fold) in the levels of cZ, cis-zeatin 9-glucoside (cZ9G), iP7G and N6-(delta2-isopentenyl)adenine 9-glucoside (iP9G) (Table 2). No statistically significant differences were detected for the content of other cytokinin metabolites. Other SOFL1-RNAi sofl2-1 lines exhibited similar changes for their endogenous cytokinin content (Table S3).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0008236.t002. Table 2. .

To investigate the potential role of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 in cytokinin-mediated development, the sensitivity of the SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 to exogenous cytokinins was examined with both callus-formation [32] and inhibition-of-hypocotyl-elongation assays [33]. Analysis of AtSOFL1:AtSOFL1-GUS and AtSOFL2:AtSOFL2-GUS indicated that AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 were expressed in the upper part of hypocotyls, but not in roots (Figure 3). Thus, a callus formation assay was performed with segments from the upper part of hypocotyls for the double mutant and the wild type control. The SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 explants produced smaller callus than control explants at 25 and 50 ng ml-1 kinetin in this assay (Figure 5), suggesting that the double mutant exhibited less sensitivity to exogenous cytokinins.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0008236.g005. Figure 5. . Response of SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 and wild-type plants to exogenous cytokinins.. Response of root explants from SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 and wild-type seedlings to different cytokinin concentrations. The upper-part hypocotyl segments were cultured for 24 days on medium containing 10 ng ml-1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and different concentrations of kinetin (A) or at the concentration of 25 ng ml-1 and 50 ng ml-1 kinetin (B).. . . . Hypocotyl elongation of wild-type plants in the dark is inhibited in the presence of cytokinin [34]. To further investigate the function of AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 in this cytokinin response, we measured hypocotyl elongation of the double mutant and control seedlings grown in the dark in the presence and absence of cytokinin (Figure 6). As was seen for wild-type seedlings, hypocotyls of the SOFL1-RNAi62 sofl2-1 seedlings were shorter in the presence of cytokinin, but a reduced response was observed when compared to the wild type (P<0.05, Figure 6). This result is consistent with the decreased sensitivity shown by the double mutant in the callus formation assay.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0008236.g006. Figure 6. .

PMC5156837	Results. . Isolation of a novel CBL10 interactor, TOC34. To identify a novel interaction partner(s) of CBL10, we extensively screened the Arabidopsis cDNA expression libraries CD4-10 and CD4-22 obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center via a yeast two-hybrid system using CBL10 as a bait. The CBL10 bait (pGBTCBL10 or BDCBL10) was made by cloning the open reading frame (ORF) of CBL10 cDNA into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT9.BS (BD). We obtained a total of 38 positive clones from this screening and found out that most of them derived from the CIPK members such as CIPK6 and CIPK24, which are previously known CBL10 interactors (Kim et al., 2007; de la Torre et al., 2013). Isolation of these genes indicated that the yeast two-hybrid screening had been performed efficiently and successfully. Among the positive clones, we were also able to discover a novel gene that does not belong to the CIPK family. Sequence analysis via GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) showed that this gene is TOC34 (Translocon of the Outer membrane of the Chloroplasts; At5g05000) encoding a polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 34.7 kDa. It was reported to act as a GTP-dependent receptor at the chloroplast surface (Andrs et al., 2010).. To test whether the full-length TOC34 protein interacts with CBL10 in yeast cells, we constructed the pGADTOC34 (ADTOC34) plasmid by cloning the ORF of TOC34 cDNA into the yeast expression vector pGADGH containing the GAL4 activation domain (AD). As shown in Figure 1, the Y190 yeast cells carrying both ADTOC34 and BDCBL10 grew well on the selection medium (SC-HLW) and exhibited a blue color in the filter-lift assay, indicating expression of the HIS3 and LacZ reporter genes, respectively. However, a vector-swapping analysis showed that the yeast cells harboring ADCBL10 and BDTOC34 did not express the two reporter genes, suggesting that the interaction between TOC34 and CBL10 occurs in a vector-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the yeast cells cotransformed with the empty vectors (either with BDTOC34 and AD, or with BD and ADTOC34), which were used as negative controls, failed to express the reporter genes. Together, these results clearly indicated that TOC34 interacts with CBL10 in the yeast two-hybrid system.. . Figure 1. . A yeast two-hybrid assay showing that TOC34 interacts with CBL10 in a vector-dependent manner. The first panel at left shows the arrangement of the Y109 yeast cells harboring the indicated BD and AD plasmids. The second and third panels display yeast growth on synthetic complete medium lacking Leu and Trp (SC-LW) and synthetic complete medium lacking His, Leu, and Trp (SC-HLW), respectively. The last panel shows beta-galactosidase activity using filter-lift assay.. . . . . . TOC34 interacts with cbl10 and cbl7 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Because the CBL family members consist of 10 genes in Arabidopsis genome (Luan et al., 2002; Kolukisaoglu et al., 2004), we also investigated whether or not the TOC34 protein could interact with other members of the CBL family using the yeast two-hybrid system. To do this, we first cloned each of the 10 CBL ORFs into the BD vector (Ok et al., 2015) and then introduced them into the Y190 yeast cells harboring ADTOC34. As shown in Figure 2, TOC34 was able to also interact with CBL7 besides CBL10, but not with other CBL family members. However, it should be noted that TOC34 interacted with CBL7 at much lower strength than with CBL10, indicating that TOC34 possesses different binding interaction affinities toward the two CBL members. This finding strongly suggests that each CBL family member can have distinct interacting partners in addition to the previously reported targets, CIPK and AtMTAN proteins (Oh et al., 2008; Luan, 2009; Ok et al., 2015).. . Figure 2. . Interaction specificity of TOC34 with CBLs in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Yeast cells (Y190 strain) were cotransformed with the combinations of the BD and AD constructs as indicated and selected on the synthetic complete media lacking Leu and Trp (SC-LW). Cotransformed yeast cells were cultured, serially diluted, and spotted onto the indicated media. Yeast growth on the synthetic complete media lacking His, Leu, and Trp (SC-HLW) indicates interaction.. . . . . . The C-terminal region of TOC34 is required for interaction with cbl10. To delimit the TOC34 region necessary for the interaction with CBL10, we created a series of deletion constructs by cloning TOC34 fragments into the AD vector. These constructs were then introduced into the Y190 yeast cells carrying either BD or BDCBL10. Interactions were determined by monitoring whether or not the transformed yeast cells grow well on the selection medium (SC-HLW). As shown in Figure 3, removal of the last 54 amino acids from the C-terminal end of TOC34 (ADTOC34-N) completely disrupted its interaction with CBL10, whereas the N-terminal deletion down to 260th amino acid residue containing small GTP-binding domain of TOC34 (ADTOC34-C1) maintained the interaction with CBL10. However, a further deletion down to 283th amino acid residue (ADTOC34-C2) containing a transmembrane domain (267 to 283 amino acid residues) resulted in abolishing the interaction. These results indicated that the 23-amino acid residues of TOC34, spanning from 261 to 283, are critical and necessary for the interaction with CBL10.. . Figure 3. . Identification of the TOC34 region responsible for the interaction with CBL10.

Numbers in the white boxes indicate the beginning and the ending positions of each protein fragment. Black boxes denote the activation domain of the GAL4 transcription factor. Numbers indicate the beginning and the ending positions of each protein fragment.. . . . . . CBL10 forms a complex with TOC34 in vitro. We performed pull-down assays in order to verify in vitro the CBL10-TOC34 interaction demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system (Figures 1, 2). To do this, we expressed and purified both TOC34 and CBL10-cMyc proteins from E. coli using the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion system. Figure 4A shows an approximately 35 kDa TOC34 protein band that was originally purified as a GST-fusion form and subsequently digested with thrombin to remove the GST protein. In the same way, the CBL10-cMyc protein was also prepared (Figure 4A). For the pull-down assays, we incubated GST-TOC34 (bait) with CBL10-cMyc (prey) in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and examined whether GST beads pulled down the CBL10-cMyc prey protein with the immunoblot analyses using anti-cMyc antibody as a probe. As shown in Figure 4B, the GST-TOC34 bait protein successfully retrieved CBL10-cMyc in the presence and absence of Ca2+, indicating that Ca2+ does not have significant influence at least on the interaction strength between CBL10 and TOC34. In contrast, GST protein alone used as a negative control failed to pull down CBL10-cMyc in both conditions. These in vitro protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that CBL10 and TOC34 physically interact with each other regardless of Ca2+.. . Figure 4. .

The GST-TOC34 fusion protein was used as a bait to pull down the prey CBL10:cMyc in the presence (+, 1mM CaCl2) or absence (-, 2mM EGTA) of calcium. For a negative control, GST alone was used as a bait. The top panel shows a western blot probed with rabbit anti-cMyc antibody and the bottom panel shows a Coomassie Brillant Blue stained SDS-PAGE gel indicating the amount of bait proteins used in each pull-down assay.. . . . . . CBL10 and TOC34 associate with each other in plant cells. We also carried out the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to further confirm the CBL10-TOC34 interaction in vivo (Walter et al., 2004). To do this, we first created TOC34-YFPN and CBL10-YFPC chimeric constructs by fusing TOC34 and CBL10 to the N-terminal YFP fragment (YFPN) and the C-terminal YFP fragment (YFPC) in the binary vectors, respectively. Subsequently, these constructs were transiently expressed in the tobacco leaves via an Agrobacterium-infiltration method. As shown in the Figure 5A fluorescence images, YFP signals were observed strongly at the outer membrane of chloroplasts and weakly at the plasma membrane of the transformed tobacco cells, indicating a physical association between CBL10 and TOC34 in a living tobacco leaf cell. The fluorescent marker dye FM4-64 was used to visualize the plasma membrane. However, no yellow fluorescence was observed from the tobacco cells expressing either TOC34-YFPN/YFPC or YFPN/CBL10-YFPC (a negative control).. . Figure 5. .

Furthermore, we also verified the CBL10-TOC34 interaction in Arabidopsis protoplasts transfected with pUC-TOC34-YFPN and pUC-CBL10-YFPC chimeric constructs. Similar to the result obtained from the tobacco leaf cells, strong YFP signals were detected around the chloroplast (Figure 5B). The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor 63, bZIP63 (At5g28770), was used as a positive control, because it is known to form a homodimer in the nucleus (Sibril et al., 2001). Taken together, these results clearly indicated that the physical interaction of CBL10 with TOC34 occurs primarily at the chloroplast in vivo.. . . Expression patterns of TOC34 and subcellular localization of TOC34. Our results above clearly indicated that CBL10 associates with TOC34 when they exist in the same space. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the spatial expression patterns of the CBL10 and TOC34 genes in order to determine whether the CBL10-TOC34 association indeed occurs in Arabidopsis plant cells. We performed qRT-PCR analysis using total RNA prepared from the various organs of 6-week-old Arabidopsis plants [ecotype Columbia (Col-0)], which include leaves, stems, flowers, and roots. As shown in Figure 6A, both TOC34 and CBL10 genes were broadly and significantly expressed in the vegetative and reproductive organs with some differences in their expression patterns and levels. TOC34 transcripts were most abundantly expressed in roots, and to a lesser extent, in flowers, stems, and leaves, which coincides with the published result (Gutensohn et al., 2004). In the case of CBL10, however, the highest expression level was observed in the leaves although the other organs also accumulated the transcripts at fairly high levels. This was also in good agreement with the previous findings (Kim et al., 2007; Quan et al., 2007). It should be noted that CBL10 was more strongly expressed in all organs tested in this study than TOC34. Anyway, TOC34 and CBL10 clearly displayed overlapping spatial expression patterns in Arabidopsis plants, and therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that the two proteins actually associate with each other in Arabidopsis cells.. . Figure 6. . Expression patterns of TOC34 and subcellular localization of TOC34. (A) Expression patterns of TOC34 and CBL10 using qRT-PCR analysis. The expression levels of TOC34 and CBL10 in roots were set to 1.0 to show relative abundance differences. Actin2 gene was employed as an internal control. Error bars denote standard deviation (SD) of three technical replicates. Significance was calculated using the Student's t-test: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (B) Localization pattern of TOC34. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with 35S::GFP (left two columns) or 35S::TOC3-GFP (right two columns), and GFP fluorescence was examined. GFP, Auto-F, Bright, and Merge indicate GFP fluorescence signal, auto-fluorescence signal, bright field image, and merged image, respectively. Scale bars 15 mum (left two columns) and 20 mum (right two columns).. . . . We further examined the subcellular localization of TOC34 in Arabidopsis cells, although our BiFC results indicated that TOC34 can be localized at the outer membrane of the chloroplasts and the plasma membrane when co-expressed with CBL10 in plant cells. To this end, we first fused GFP to the C-terminal end of TOC34 and created a TOC34-GFP chimeric gene, which is driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (pMDTOC34). TOC34-GFP fusion protein was then transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts and visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy. According to the fluorescence images (Figure 6B), TOC34-GFP appeared to be predominantly localized at the chloroplasts (probably, the outer envelope membrane) and to a much lesser extent at the plasma membrane, which is generally consistent with the previous report (Dhanoa et al., 2010). The GFP control, however, exhibited similar intensities of fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm.. . . Ca2+-bound CBL10 significantly inhibits the GTPase activity of the TOC34 protein. Because TOC34 acts as a GTP-dependent receptor at the outer membrane of the chloroplast (Jarvis et al., 1998), we attempted to empirically determine whether the recombinant GST-TOC34 protein prepared from E. coli is able to hydrolyze GTP into GDP and inorganic phosphate. As shown in Figure 7A, GST-TOC34 successfully yielded free phosphate (~10 U/mug), whereas GST alone did not. These enzyme assays clearly suggested that the TOC34 protein indeed possesses the GTPase activity in vitro. Because TOC34 can form a complex with the Ca2+-binding protein CBL10, we also examined the effect of CBL10 on the GTPase activity of the TOC34 protein in the presence or absence of Ca2+. As shown in Figure 7B, the GTPase activity of TOC34 was most significantly decreased when both CBL10 and Ca2+ were present together. Without either Ca2+ or CBL10, however, such a strong inhibitory effect was not detected. Furthermore, it is also important to noted that CBL4, which is another member of the CBL family and does not associate with TOC34, did not exert any substantial effect on the TOC34 enzymatic activity regardless of Ca2+. Together, these results clearly indicate that the GTPase activity of TOC34 can be specifically inhibited by the association with Ca2+-bound CBL10.. . Figure 7. . Inhibition of GTPase activity of TOC34 by Ca2+-bound CBL10. (A) The GTPase activity of purified GST-TOC34 protein.

PMC3266875	Results. . Pathogen infection and elicitor treatment alter the expression of cytokinin signaling components in Arabidopsis. We examined the expression of Arabidopsis genes encoding elements involved in cytokinin signal transduction (Figure 1A) in response to pathogen treatment. Publicly available microarray data deposited at AtGenExpress (http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/plantphys/AFGN/atgenex.htm) were analyzed using the e-northern tool of the Bio-Array Resource for Arabidopsis Functional Genomics (http://bar.utoronto.ca/) [22] (Figure 1B). Among the genes encoding two-component elements, the expression levels of type-A ARR genes were most affected by pathogen treatment. This is similar to what is observed after treatment of plants with exogenous cytokinin [16], [23]. While the expression of genes encoding two-component elements was clearly altered by pathogen treatment, there was no direct correlation between the pattern of gene expression and pathogen lifestyle with respect to biotrophic (G. orontii), hemibiotrophic (P. syringae ES2346, P. infestans) or necrotrophic (B. cinerea) pathogens, or elicitors derived from biotrophic pathogens. These results are consistent with a role for two-component elements in the response to a variety of plant pathogens.. . . Cytokinin treatment alters susceptibility of Arabidopsis plants to Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis isolate Noco2. Due to contrasting reports regarding the role of cytokinins during plant immune system responses [18], we examined the effect of a range of concentrations of exogenous cytokinin on the responses of wild-type Arabidopsis plants (accession Col-0) to the virulent oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis isolate Noco2 (Hpa Noco2). Hpa Noco2 is a well-adapted obligate biotrophic pathogen of Arabidopsis that is able to overcome defense responses of wild-type plants and establish an intimate relationship with its host. Two-week-old plants were treated with increasing concentrations of the cytokinin benzyl adenine (BA) or a vehicle control (DMSO) 48 hours prior to pathogen treatment (Figure 1C). We observed distinctive effects of cytokinin on the susceptibility of wild-type plants to Hpa Noco2 at the different concentrations tested. Treatment with low concentrations of exogenous cytokinin led to enhanced susceptibility to Hpa Noco2, indicating that cytokinin-dependent processes contribute to the susceptibility to this pathogen (Figure 1C). In contrast, treatment with higher levels of cytokinin (>10 M) led to decreased susceptibility to Hpa Noco2, indicating a threshold above which the action of cytokinin has a negative impact on the susceptibility of Arabidopsis to Hpa Noco2 (Figure 1C).. . . Treatment with high concentrations of cytokinin primes SA-dependent defense responses in Arabidopsis. We further investigated the effect of cytokinin on plant immunity. Pre-treatment of wild-type plants with high concentrations of cytokinin led to decreased susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 (Figure 2A). The added cytokinin induced a cytokinin response as shown by the up-regulation of the cytokinin-inducible gene ARR7 (Figure 2D). The effect of high levels of cytokinin on the growth of Hpa Noco2 was not due to off-target effects of BA or direct effects on Hpa Noco2 growth as it was abrogated by disruption of the AHK2 and AHK3 cytokinin receptors (Figure 2B). Comparable levels of cytokinin have been shown to elicit biologically relevant levels of cytokinin signaling in other assays for cytokinin responses [24], [25]. Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that could account for this effect of cytokinin on Hpa Noco2 susceptibility are: 1) changes in host metabolism that could result in poor pathogen growth; or 2) increased activation of defense responses. Because SA plays a significant role in plant immunity [26], [27], we tested if this response to high concentrations of cytokinin was a result of activation of SA-mediated responses by examining the eds16 mutant in which the ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1 (ICS1) gene required for SA biosynthesis [28], [29] is mutated. eds16 plants displayed a substantially reduced response to high concentrations (100 M) of cytokinin (Figure 2C) as compared to wild-type plants. This indicates that the effect of high concentrations of cytokinin is largely dependent on SA biosynthesis, which is consistent with a role for cytokinin upstream of SA during activation of defense responses by Hpa Noco2. Interestingly, there is a slight decrease in pathogen growth in the eds16 plants at lower cytokinin concentrations (1 M) that is not observed in wild-type plants, suggesting that eds16 plants are hypersensitive to cytokinin (Figure 2C; see also below).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002448.g002. Figure 2. . High concentrations of cytokinin prime defense responses via SA accumulation.. Susceptibility of cytokinin-treated wild-type (A), ahk2,3 (B) or eds16 (C) plants to Hpa Noco2.

Error bars represent SE from three technical replicates and correspond to upper and lower limits of 95% confidence intervals. At least three independent biological replicates of the experiment were conducted with similar results. Data from one representative independent biological replicate are shown. (F) Defense gene expression is enhanced by pre-treatment with cytokinin. Two-week-old wild-type and eds16 plants were pre-treated with the indicated concentration of BA or DMSO control 48 hours prior to inoculation with water or Hpa Noco2. RNA was extracted from tissue harvested at 3 dpi. Transcripts levels were determined by qRT-PCR relative to the respective DMSO-treated genotypes. Error bars represent SE from three technical replicates and correspond to upper and lower limits of 95% confidence intervals. At least three independent biological replicates of the experiment were conducted with similar results. Data from one representative independent biological replicate are shown.. . . . To further understand the relationship of high concentrations of cytokinin and plant immunity, we analyzed the expression of SA-responsive genes in response to cytokinin treatment and inoculation with Hpa Noco2 (Figure 2E, 2F). While much defense transcriptional reprogramming generally occurs early after pathogen recognition [30], [31], we chose to look at gene expression changes three days post inoculation (dpi) when an estimated 40% of plant mesophyll cells are in contact with Hpa hyphae and/or haustoria [32]. The SA-responsive genes tested were marginally up-regulated by cytokinin treatment alone in wild-type plants (Figure 2E). This increase in expression in response to cytokinin was partially dependent on SA biosynthesis as it was generally diminished in eds16 plants. As expected, the defense genes examined were markedly up-regulated by inoculation with Hpa Noco2 in the wild-type, but to a reduced extent in eds16 plants (Figure 2F). While cytokinin treatment alone only led to a slight induction in defense gene expression, pre-treatment with cytokinin followed by Hpa Noco2 inoculation led to a further enhancement of the expression of the defense genes tested (Figure 2F). These results suggest that cytokinin acts by priming defense-gene expression in Arabidopsis. This potentiation of defense gene expression by cytokinin was partially dependent on SA as revealed by gene expression analysis of similarly treated eds16 plants (Figure 2E, 2F).. . . SA negatively regulates cytokinin signaling. Treatment of wild-type plants with low concentrations of cytokinin (100 nM), which are sufficient to induce expression of the cytokinin-regulated gene ARR7 (Figure 3C), results in increased susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 (Figure 1C, Figure 3A). We examined if the effect of low concentrations of cytokinin on susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 was dependent on endogenous SA, as was observed for higher levels of cytokinin. eds16 plants did not show an increase in pathogen growth after cytokinin treatment (Figure 3B), suggesting that basal levels of SA may be required for the promotion of susceptibility by low levels of cytokinin. Alternatively, the hyper-susceptible phenotype of eds16 plants [28] may preclude quantification of marginal increases in the growth of pathogens.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002448.g003. Figure 3. .

Statistically significant differences from wild-type plants (one-tailed student's t-test) are represented by asterisks (*=p-value<0.05, **=p-value<0.075). (E) Primary root elongation assay for cytokinin sensitivity. Wild-type, eds16 or ahk2,3 seedlings were grown vertically on plates supplemented with the specified concentrations of BA or DMSO control under constant light conditions at 23C. Primary root elongation between days 4 and 9 was measured as described in Methods. Results shown were pooled from an experimental set of three independent samples of 10 to 15 individual seedlings each. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from the wild type at the given concentrations of BA (two-tailed student's t-test, P<0.05). Error bars represent SE (n22). This experiment was repeated twice with consistent results.. . . . We examined the effect of SA on cytokinin responsiveness by examining the expression of cytokinin-regulated genes [16] in untreated eds16 plants. The basal level of expression of genes positively regulated by cytokinin (ARR7, ATST4B, and to a lesser extent CKX4; [16]) were significantly elevated in eds16 plants relative to the wild-type. Conversely, the expression of XTR7 (XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE 7), which is negatively regulated by cytokinin, was further down-regulated in eds16 relative to the wild-type (Figure 3D). We also analyzed the response of eds16 plants to cytokinin using a primary root elongation assay [10], [33]. Wild-type seedlings showed inhibition of root elongation by BA concentrations above 50 nM, while ahk2,4 control plants were largely resistant to BA. eds16 plants displayed a significant and reproducible hypersensitivity to cytokinin at lower concentrations of cytokinin (Figure 3E). Together, these results suggest that SA negatively regulates cytokinin responsiveness, consistent with the hypersensitivity of eds16 mutants to cytokinin with regard to pathogen growth (Figure 2C).. . . Mutations in two-component elements alter susceptibility to Hpa Noco2. To further address the mechanism of cytokinin action in plant immunity, we examined the requirement for a host phosphorelay mechanism in the susceptibility of Arabidopsis to Hpa Noco2. Consistent with a role for cytokinin in plant immunity, disruption of the cytokinin receptors (AHK2, AHK3 or AHK4) resulted in enhanced susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 (Figure 4A). The ahk3,4 and ahk2,4 double mutants, but not the ahk2,3 double mutant, displayed an additive increase in susceptibility, indicating that the cytokinin receptors play partially redundant roles in defense responses to this pathogen, similar to their overlapping roles in other cytokinin-regulated physiological processes [34]-[36]. The triple receptor mutant was not used in this study due to its small, stunted phenotype, which precludes us from drawing any meaningful conclusions from pathogen assays in this background.. Unlike the other two-component elements, type-A ARRs are negative regulators of cytokinin signaling [7]-[10]. There are ten genes encoding type-A ARRs in Arabidopsis. Due to partial redundancy in this gene family, increased sensitivity to cytokinin is apparent only in quadruple and higher order multiple mutants. The type-A arr multiple mutants arr5,6,8,9 and arr3,4,5,6,8,9 showed decreased susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 (Figure 4B) as compared to wild-type plants. Similar to their roles in cytokinin signaling, the respective single mutations had no measurable effect on susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 (data not shown). Interestingly, the arr3,4,5,6 mutant, which has an equivalent hypersensitivity to cytokinin as the arr5,6,8,9 mutant in several response assays [10], did not exhibit any difference in susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 compared to wild-type plants, suggesting combinatorial specificity in this response (Figure 4B). Together, these results indicate that cytokinin signaling components play partially overlapping roles in plant immunity; the cytokinin receptors exert a mainly positive role, while the type-A ARRs have a negative regulatory effect.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002448.g004.

Two-week-old wild-type plants or transgenic lines overexpressing wild-type (ARR5, ARR6, ARR9), phospho-mimic (ARR5D87E) and phospho-deficient (ARR5D87A) forms of type-A ARRs were inoculated with Hpa Noco2 and spore production measured as described in Methods.

Levels of the indicated transcripts were determined by qRT-PCR relative to water-treated samples. Error bars represent SE from three technical replicates and correspond to upper and lower limits of 95% confidence intervals. At least three independent biological replicates of the experiment were conducted with similar results. Data from one representative independent biological replicate are shown.. . . . . . Type-A ARRs negatively regulate plant immunity in a phospho-dependent manner. To further explore the role of type-A ARRs in plant immunity, we examined the effect of overexpression of type-A ARRs on the susceptibility to Hpa Noco2. Consistent with the decreased susceptibility phenotype observed in the loss-of-function type-A arr multiple mutants, transgenic lines overexpressing type-A ARR genes under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter [33] showed enhanced susceptibility (Figure 4C). This suggests that susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 is correlated to the level of type-A ARRs. Phosphorylation of type-A ARRs on a conserved residue (Asp87) in the receiver domain is required for type-A ARR activation and function in cytokinin signaling [33]. Therefore, we tested whether this phosphorylation is required for the enhanced susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 seen in transgenic lines overexpressing type-A ARRs. Transgenic lines overexpressing phospho-mimic (ARR5D87E) and phospho-deficient (ARR5D87A) forms of ARR5 were tested for their susceptibility to Hpa Noco2. These lines have been characterized and shown to express similar protein levels, and the ARR5D87E and ARR5D87A proteins have been shown to retain their ability to interact with two-component elements in a yeast two-hybrid assay, indicating proper folding [33]. Similar to lines overexpressing wild-type type-A ARRs, overexpression of ARR5D87E also led to enhanced susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 (Figure 4C). Conversely, plants overexpressing ARR5D87A were not statistically significantly different from wild-type plants in their susceptibility to Hpa Noco2 (Figure 4C). Moreover, the expression levels of the defense genes tested were reduced in both unchallenged (Figure 4D) and Hpa-induced (Figure 4E) ARR overexpressing lines in comparison to wild-type plants. These results indicate that it is the phosphorylated form of type-A ARRs that play a negative role in regulating defense responses in both unchallenged plants and in response to Hpa Noco2.. . . Type-A ARRs negatively regulate SA-dependent basal immunity. The potential role of type-A ARRs in basal defense gene expression and Hpa Noco2-triggered responses led us to investigate transcriptional reprogramming in response to Hpa Noco2 in the type-A arr3,4,5,6,8,9 multiple mutant. Wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants were treated with either water or inoculated with Hpa Noco2 and tissue harvested three days after treatment. RNA from replicate samples from independent experiments was prepared and gene expression analyzed using ATH1 Affymetrix microarrays. Samples were normalized to the water-treated wild-type samples. The expression levels of 1583 genes were significantly altered in wild-type plants in response to inoculation with Hpa Noco2 (Figure 5A). Transcriptome changes were similar in wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants in response to Hpa Noco2, both in amplitude and in the set of genes regulated (Table S1). However, 292 of these regulated genes were expressed at levels 20-50% higher in water-treated arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants as compared to water-treated wild-type plants; hence they are under negative control by type-A ARRs. Representatives selected from the most markedly de-repressed cluster (Figure 5A, red asterisk) include several genes involved in SA-mediated defense signaling (e.g. FRK1, PAD4, FMO1 and WRKY18), SA biosynthesis (ICS1), and SA-mediated defense markers (e.g. PR5). Conversely, a subset of genes known to be down-regulated by SA, such as PDF1.2, displayed reduced basal expression in arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants (Figure 5B). We confirmed these results for a subset of genes in an independent experiment using qRT-PCR (Figure 5D). These results suggest that type-A arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants are primed for defense responses, exhibiting a slight elevation of SA-dependent defense gene expression even in the absence of applied biotic stress.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002448.g005. Figure 5. . Type-A ARRs negatively regulate SA-dependent gene expression.. (A) Transcriptome analysis of type-A arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants in response to Hpa Noco2. Two-week-old wild-type or type-A arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants were inoculated with either water or Hpa Noco2. Tissue was harvested at 3 dpi. For the analysis, wild-type water-treated samples were used as a baseline. Genes up- or down-regulated at least two-fold by Hpa Noco2 in wild-type plants were selected. Hierarchical clustering (K-means) of Hpa Noco2-regulated genes in wild-type plants is shown. See also Table S1. (B) Subset of Hpa Noco2-regulated genes with altered expression in the arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutants. Hpa Noco2-regulated genes from the most highly regulated cluster from (A) (red asterisk) that are differentially regulated in unchallenged arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants. (C) Representative cytokinin-regulated genes that are also Hpa Noco2-regulated. (D) qRT-PCR of select genes from (A). Two-week-old wild-type or arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants were inoculated with water. RNA was extracted from tissue harvested three days later. Levels of the indicated transcripts were determined by qRT-PCR relative to wild-type plants. Error bars represent SE from three technical replicates and correspond to upper and lower limits of 95% confidence intervals. Data from one biological replicate are shown.. . . . Previously described cytokinin-responsive genes [16] were also differentially regulated by Hpa Noco2 in wild-type plants (Figure 5C). The overlap between the suites of cytokinin- and Hpa Noco2-regulated genes supports a function for cytokinin in plant immunity and suggests a role for cytokinin-regulated processes in the pathogenicity of Hpa Noco2. The altered expression of both suites of genes in arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutants indicates that these processes converge at the level of type-A ARR function.. . . Type-A ARRs suppress defense gene expression downstream of SA. Among the genes induced by Hpa Noco2 and de-repressed in arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants is ICS1, which encodes an enzyme involved in SA biosynthesis. We hypothesized that the altered expression of SA-dependent genes observed in arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants is a direct result of altered regulation of ICS1 and SA metabolism, and subsequent activation of SA-dependent defense responses. We examined SA accumulation in the wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,8,9, and the contribution of Hpa Noco2 and high concentrations of cytokinin (100 M BA) to this response. SA levels in wild-type plants, regardless of treatment, remained at or below levels of detection of our assay. These results are similar to published results of SA levels in Arabidopsis plants after infection with virulent isolates of Hpa. [37] and reflect the relatively weaker defense responses elicited by virulent pathogens and the nature of the Hpa-Arabidopsis interaction, in which a limited number of plant cells are in contact with the pathogen at early stages of infection. The SA levels of arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants treated with DMSO, cytokinin or Hpa Noco2 were also at or below the detection limits of our SA assay (Figure 6A). In contrast arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants pre-treated with cytokinin and subsequently challenged with Hpa Noco2 showed a significant and reproducible increase in SA levels, well above the detection limits of our assay (Figure 6A). These results suggest that the increased defense responses observed in arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant plants are due to increased SA content.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002448.g006. Figure 6. . Type-A ARRs act in plant immunity downstream of SA.. (A) Total SA production in response to Hpa Noco2 after cytokinin treatment. Two-week-old wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants were pre-treated with the indicated concentration of BA or DMSO control 48 hours prior to inoculation with water or Hpa Noco2. Tissue was harvested at 3 dpi and total SA (SA+SAG) measured as described in Methods. Error bars represent SE (n4). The experiment was repeated at least three times independently. Data from one representative experiment are shown. (B) ICS1 expression in response to Hpa Noco2 after cytokinin treatment. Two-week-old wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants were treated as in (A). Tissue was harvested at 3 dpi. Levels of ICS1 were determined by qRT-PCR relative to water-treated samples pre-treated with DMSO. For simplicity, the relative change of all samples was normalized to the wild-type DMSO+Hpa Noco2 levels. Error bars represent SE from three technical replicates and correspond to upper and lower limits of 95% confidence intervals. The experiment was repeated at least three times independently. Data from one representative experiment are shown. (C) PR1 expression in response to Hpa Noco2 after cytokinin treatment. Two-week-old wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants were treated as in (A). Tissue was harvested at 3 dpi. Levels of PR1 were determined by qRT-PCR relative to water-treated samples pre-treated with DMSO. For simplicity, the relative change for all samples was normalized to the wild-type DMSO+Hpa Noco2 levels. Error bars represent SE from three technical replicates and correspond to upper and lower limits of 95% confidence intervals. The experiment was repeated at least three times independently. Data from one representative experiment are shown. (D) Trypan blue staining after Hpa Noco2 inoculation. Two-week-old wild-type and arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants were treated as in (A). Plants were harvested at 4 dpi and stained with lacto-phenol trypan blue to visualize pathogen structures.. . . . The results of our SA assays led us to examine the expression of ICS1 and the defense marker PR1 in these plants. As expected, ICS1 expression was elevated synergistically by Hpa Noco2 and cytokinin treatment in both genotypes. arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants showed even further up-regulation of ICS1, which could account for elevated SA levels observed in these plants (Figure 6B). Surprisingly, levels of PR1 were equally high in the arr3,4,5,6,8,9 mutant treated with cytokinin, or with cytokinin and Hpa Noco2, even though levels of SA and ICS1 differed (Figure 6C). These results indicate that in the absence of functional type-A ARRs, cytokinin can bypass the requirement for recognition of Hpa Noco2 on the activation of defense responses, suggesting a role for type-A ARRs in the suppression of defense responses downstream of SA accumulation. Consistent with increased defense gene expression and SA content, arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants treated with cytokinin also exhibited increased resistance to Hpa Noco2 (Figure 6D). To better score susceptibility, plants were stained with lactophenol-trypan blue at 4 dpi. At this point during infection, wild-type plants pre-treated with DMSO showed widespread hyphal growth and sporulation, while wild-type plants pre-treated with cytokinin had not yet produced sporangiophores and displayed diminished hyphal growth. DMSO-treated arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants showed decreased susceptibility compared to similarly-treated wild-type plants, and this was even more apparent in arr3,4,5,6,8,9 plants pre-treated with cytokinin, which showed substantially reduced hyphal growth (Figure 6D)..
PMC2156172	Results. . A T-DNA mutation in AtS1P demonstrates a role for this subtilisin-like serine protease gene in salt stress responses. Some of the important components of the ATF6-related ER stress response in mammalian cells are the stress sensor ATF6, chaperones such as BiP, and Golgi-located protein processing factors (Chen et al., 2002; Shen et al., 2002). A key processing factor is S1P, a subtilisin-like serine protease or subtilase that initiates the processing of ATF6. Arabidopsis encodes a large family of subtilases (Rautengarten et al., 2005), and one of them, AtS1P, At5g19660, is surprisingly similar to human S1P (P = 4.4e-231; Figure S1). Like most other Arabidopsis subtilases, AtS1P has a preprodomain structure, in that it has an N-terminal signal peptide targeting it to the secretory pathway, and a subterminal prodomain that is processed upon activation of the proenzyme. However, AtS1P differs from other Arabidopsis subtilases by the presence of a long C-terminal tail with a transmembrane domain (TMD) near its C-terminus (Figure 1a).. . Figure 1. . Properties of AtS1P. (a) Map of AtS1P protein showing preprodomains and transmembrane segment. (b) Map of AtS1P gene (At5g19660) and T-DNA mutations s1p-1 (SALK_097923), with a T-DNA insertion in the 5 untranslated region (5-UTR), s1p-2 (SALK_111474) in the 5th exon, s1p-3 (SALK_020530) in the 7th exon, and s1p-4 (SALK_006592) and s1p-5 (SALK_006866) in the 8th exon. (c) RT-PCR analysis to detect AtS1P transcripts in RNA extracted from 7-day-old wild-type and s1p-3 seedlings. (d and e) Root growth in wild-type and s1p-3 seedlings under (d) normal and (e) salt stress (100 mm NaCl) conditions. Bars indicate 10 mm. (f-i) Dose responses of wild-type () and s1p-3 seedlings () to salt and mannitol. Data are expressed as the percentage inhibition in root growth after 7 days [(root length on indicated salt concentration at t = 7 days/root length on 0 salt at t = 7 days)  100]. Ten seedlings were scored in each of three repetitions and mean root lengths are plotted with  SE represented by error bars.. . . . To investigate the function of AtS1P, T-DNA insertion mutations in AtS1P (s1p-1 through s1p-5) were analyzed (Figure 1b). The mutant s1p-3, with a T-DNA insertion in the 7th exon, was considered a knockout mutation as no AtS1P transcripts were detected in the line (Figure 1c). None of the T-DNA mutants in AtS1P had observable seedling or mature plant phenotypes under normal conditions. However, it was found that s1p-3 was more sensitive to salt stress. In the absence of salt stress, s1p-3 and wild-type roots grew at about the same rate (Figure 1d), but s1p-3 root growth was reduced in comparison with wild type on 50 and 100 mM NaCl (Figure 1e,f). The mutant s1p-3 was also sensitive to other monovalent salts, such as KCl and LiCl, and to mannitol (Figure 1g-i). Thus, s1p-3 is sensitive to salt-induced osmotic stress. (For convenience we use the term salt stress throughout the paper.). To determine whether the T-DNA in s1p-3 was responsible for the salt sensitivity, the mutant was crossed with wild type, and salt sensitivity in the F2 generation co-segregated with the T-DNA (chi2 = 1.68, P = 0.20; Fig. S2a). A cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter:AtS1P cDNA construct rescued s1p-3 salt sensitivity in line S1P-9, confirming that AtS1P is responsible for the salt-sensitive phenotype (Fig. S2b). From these findings, we concluded that AtS1P functions in salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.. We examined other properties of AtS1P to better understand its role in salt tolerance, and to determine if this subtilase functions in ER stress responses in a manner comparable with mammalian S1P. An essential feature about the function of mammalian S1P in ER stress is its localization in the Golgi. To determine if AtS1P is similarly located, we fused the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to the C-terminus of AtS1P and expressed it in transgenic Arabidopsis using the 35S promoter. We found that the YFP signal was largely located in punctate structures of leaf epidermal cells co-localizing with a fluorescent marker, BODIPY TR ceramide, which has been used by others as a Golgi marker (Figure 2a-c; Vadaie et al., 2002; Egelund et al., 2006). From this, we concluded that AtS1P is also likely to be a Golgi-resident protein in Arabidopsis. To determine where AtS1P is expressed in Arabidopsis plants, AtS1P promoter:GUS constructs were developed and found to be expressed in the vasculature of roots, cotyledons and leaves of seedlings (Figure 2d, e).. .

Scale bars = 1 mm in (d and f) and 0.1 mm in (e and g).. . . . . . A membrane-associated bZIP transcription factor, AtbZIP17, mediates salt stress responses and is processed by AtS1P. The bZIP transcription factor, ATF6, is a target of S1P processing in ER stress responses in mammalian cells, and the transcription factor has a characteristic structure of a type-II membrane protein with an N-terminal bZIP domain, a transmembrane domain and a canonical (RXXL or RXLX) S1P cleavage site on the luminal side of the membrane (Figure 3a). We looked for bZIP factors with similar structures in the Arabidopsis genome and identified three, AtbZIP17 (At2g40950), AtbZIP28 (At3g10800) and AtbZIP49 (At3g56660), which we compared with AtbZIP60 (At1g42990) (Figure 3b). To determine whether any of these bZIP factors might be involved in salt tolerance, available T-DNA insertions in AtbZIP17 and AtbZIP28 were screened for salt sensitivity, and it was found that zip17 (SALK_104326, T-DNA insertion in the first exon of AtbZIP17; Figure 4a) was modestly salt sensitive (Figure 4b,c). The mutant was considered to be a knockout mutation because AtbZIP17 transcripts were not detected by RT-PCR (Figure 4d). The salt sensitivity trait co-segregated with the T-DNA (chi2 = 0.79, P = 0.37) in backcrosses to wild type (Figure S2c), and a 35S promoter:AtbZIP17 cDNA construct, used in developing line ZIP-4, rescued the salt-sensitive phenotype (Figure 4b,c; Figure S2d). These findings confirmed that the T-DNA insertion was responsible for the salt-sensitive phenotype.. . Figure 4. . Properties of the zip17 T-DNA insertion mutation in AtbZIP17.

To determine whether AtbZIP17 is processed in response to salt stress, an N-terminal myc-tagged AtbZIP17 construct was developed and introduced into transgenic seedlings. It was found that the 84-kDa construct was processed in vivo to a 46-kDa protein in salt-treated seedlings in a wild-type background (Figure 5a), consistent with cleavage in or near the TMD of AtbZIP17 (Figure 3a). The processing of AtbZIP17 did not occur in similarly treated s1p-3 seedlings (Figure 5a). We did not observe an intermediate corresponding to processing at the S1P site in vivo. However, processing intermediates of ATF6 have not been directly observed in mammalian cells either, suggesting that the S1P-cleaved intermediate is short lived (Ye et al., 2000). We did consistently observe that more 84-kDa precursor accumulated after salt treatment than before, and that more 46-kDa product was produced than expected from the quantity of precursor (Figure 5a). One explanation is that the precursor turns over in the ER membrane under normal conditions, and that both the precursor and product are stabilized following stress. An examination of that possibility is underway.. . Figure 5. . Processing of AtbZIP17 in vivo and in vitro. (a) Processing in vivo of a 35S:myc-AtbZIP17 construct in wild-type and s1p-3 seedlings incubated in high salt medium for the times indicated. (b) Processing in vitro of a His-tagged C-terminal form of AtbZIP17 by incubation with AtS1P-myc-HDEL in an anti-c-myc agarose bead pull-down assay. Reaction products were analyzed by western blot with anti-His antibody. Lanes showing lack of processing by an empty vector control (pSKM-myc) and by inhibition with 2 mm EGTA and 1 mm PMSF (phenymethylsuphony fluoride) are indicated.. . . . Processing of ATF6 in mammalian cells is a regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) process involving cleavage of the protein by S1P, followed by S2P digestion and release from the ER of the cytosolic component of the protein (Ye et al., 2000). RIP processing of ATF6 is thought to be dependent on prior S1P cleavage to remove the bulky lumenal domain, making the protein accessible to S2P digestion (Shen and Prywes, 2004). Although we did not directly observe S1P cleavage of AtbZIP17 in vivo, we wanted to determine whether AtbZIP17 is indeed a substrate for proteolysis by AtS1P. To do so, we tested whether AtbZIP17 could be cleaved by affinity-purified AtS1P in an in vitro pull-down assay. A myc-tagged form of AtS1P (AtS1P-myc-HDEL) produced in transgenic Arabidopsis was pulled down out of plant extracts with anti-myc agarose beads. (The AtS1P-myc-HDEL construct lacks a transmembrane domain to aid in solubilizing the protein and has an HDEL element to retain the protein in the ER.) The beads were washed extensively and incubated with a C-terminal His-tagged, lumen-facing fragment of AtbZIP17 (40 kDa; Figure 5b). The products of the in vitro reaction were analyzed on western blots, and a 10-kDa protein product consistent with cleavage at the canonical S1P site in AtbZIP17 was found. The product was not formed in controls when plant extracts from transgenic plants bearing an empty vector were used, or when the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) or the calcium chelator EGTA was added to the reaction. From this we posit that AtS1P directly targets AtbZIP17 for proteolysis, which makes the protein further accessible for cleavage by S2P-like processing activities. If AtS1P does indeed process AtbZIP17 in response to salt stress, then one would expect the two gene products to interact and be expressed in the same tissues. The expression pattern of AtbZIP17 promoter:GUS demonstrated that AtbZIP17 is expressed mainly in the vasculature (Figure 2f,g), similar to the tissue expression pattern for AtS1P (Figure 2d,e).. We were interested in understanding the consequences of proteolytic processing of AtbZIP17 with respect to the subcellular localization of the protein. We examined its subcellular localization under salt stress and non-stressed conditions using a 35S promoter:mGFP-AtbZIP17 construct. When grown on agar in the absence of added NaCl, mGFP fluorescence was located in cytoplasmic strands co-localizing with a fluorescent ER marker, ER-tracker DapoxyTM(DPX) (Figure 6a-c), and was excluded from nuclei (Figure 6d-f). However, after incubation of seedlings overnight on 100 mm NaCl, mGFP fluorescence from the N-terminal labeled fusion protein appeared in nuclei (Figure 6g-i). Nuclear relocalization happened on a time scale consistent with the observations on in vivo processing (Figure 5a). We observed substantial nuclear relocation of fluorescence 2 h after salt stress, and nearly maximal nuclear relocation after 4 h (Figure 6j-k). We interpret this to mean that the N-terminal component of AtbZIP17 relocates from the ER to the nucleus in response to salt stress. We have not yet observed intermediate stages in the nuclear relocation process, particularly whether AtbZIP17 moves through the Golgi. We found that AtbZIP17 is predicted to be Golgi-localized based on the attributes of its TMD (Yuan and Teasdale, 2002). However, further investigation will be needed to determine whether AtbZIP17 transiently relocates to the Golgi following salt treatment.. . Figure 6. .

The cytosolic-facing component of AtbZIP17 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of salt stress genes. To determine whether AtbZIP17 has transcription factor activity, and, if so, to identify where the activity is located, various elements of the N-terminal cytosolic-facing component of AtbZIP17 were fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain, and tested for transcriptional activation in yeast (Figure 7). Those constructs bearing the N-terminal 138 amino acids of AtbZIP17 activated the LacZ reporter gene in yeast, indicating that the N-terminal domain of AtbZIP17 is a transcriptional activator. Thus, the N-terminal cytoplasmic-facing segment of AtbZIP17, which is translocated to the nucleus during salt stress, bears bZIP DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains.. . Figure 7. . Identification of the transcriptional activation domain in AtbZIP17. Transcriptional activation domain in AtbZIP17 was identified by fusing various segments of the cytoplasm-facing component of the gene in yeast with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Indicated on the map of AtbZIP17 are the transcriptional activation domain (TAD), bZIP DNA binding domain (bZIP), proline-rich domain (PRD), transmembrane domain (TMD) and canonical S1P site. Transcriptional activity was demonstrated by X-Gal staining.. . . . To identify genes activated by AtbZIP17, we looked for salt stress responsive genes with altered expression in s1p-3. To do so, 1-week-old wild-type and s1p-3 seedlings were transferred to liquid media with or without 100 mm NaCl, and were harvested 4 h later for RNA extraction. Affymetrix Arabidopsis gene chips (ATH1) were used to profile gene expression, and significant changes in the estimated means of gene expression were determined while controlling for a false discovery rate of 1.00E-02 (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003). Genes were rank ordered by increases in expression under salt stress conditions in wild type compared with s1p-3, and those that differed in expression by more than 2.5-fold are shown (Table 1). To determine whether AtbZIP17 exercises control over these genes during salt stress, their expression was assessed in zip17 (T-DNA mutant) using semiquantitative RT-PCR (Figure 8). Exposure to 100 mM NaCl elevates the expression of these genes in wild type, but much less so in zip17. These findings are consistent with a model in which AtS1P initiates the activation of AtbZIP17, which either directly or indirectly upregulates genes such as ATHB-7. It is interesting that genes such as BiP1, BiP2 and BiP3, which are considered to be ER stress markers, were not significantly induced by salt stress.. . Table 1. .

PMC4506504	Results. . All core circadian clock genes oscillate in LR primordia. To identify novel genes and mechanisms regulating LR development, we initially generated a transcriptomic time course data set covering every stage of LR development. We previously showed that, following a 90 gravitropic stimulus, LRs develop in a highly synchronized manner at the outer edge of a bending root (Fig. 1a,b)14. In Col-0 roots, under our growth conditions, stage I LR primordia are detected at 15h post gravity induction (pgi) and LRs emerged 42h pgi (Fig. 1a,b). We took advantage of this regular LR primordium development by microdissecting root bends every 3h from 6 to 54h pgi (Fig. 1b,c). For this, Col-0 seedlings were grown without previous entrainment in constant light conditions for 3 days, before the gravity stimulus was applied. From four independent biological replicates of each time point, Affymetrix transcript abundance data were generated, encompassing every stage from pre-initiation to post-emergence (Fig. 1b; microarray data are publicly available at ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) under the accession number E-MTAB-2565; all data shown in this manuscript are averages from those four replicates). Initial quality control testing confirmed the ability of the data set to identify LR development regulatory genes. We examined the transcript abundance of several known key LR regulators: AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) 19, LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD) 16, 18 and 29, SHORT HYPOCOTYL 2 (SHY2), GATA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 23 (GATA23), CYCLIN B1;1 (CYCB1;1) and LIKE AUX1 3 (LAX3) (Supplementary Fig. 1), which were all significantly upregulated at previously published time points131516171819. In total, >8,000 genes were differentially expressed across all time points and principal component (PC) analysis revealed an oscillatory pattern in the third PC with a period of 24h (PC3; Fig. 1d)20. Clustering of transcript abundance profiles generated a set of 77 clusters, revealing a broad range of gene mRNA patterns during LR development (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 1). Consistent with PC3, 17 clusters exhibited an oscillatory pattern with a period ranging from 19.4 to 35.9h (Fig. 1d,e; Supplementary Fig. 2), and four oscillating clusters comprised well-characterized core circadian clock genes (blue in Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2; cluster 35 contains ELF3, cluster 60 GI and PRR7, cluster 66 CCA1 and LHY, cluster 73 TOC1, PRR5, PRR3 and ELF4; the individual transcript abundance patterns of these nine core circadian clock genes are shown in Fig. 2).. To validate that the LR transcriptome displays circadian oscillations under free-running conditions, we analysed the data set using the JTK_CYCLE algorithm21. Rhythmic components were identified in the mRNA patterns of 1,575 genes, including all the core circadian clock genes, with an average period length of 25.3h (Supplementary Data 2). As such a large proportion of genes were oscillating close to a 24-h period in the data set, we investigated the behaviour of the set of nine core circadian clock component genes in more detail (Fig. 2). All nine genes clearly showed oscillatory transcript abundance, and the period of rhythms in LHY and CCA1 mRNAs in the LR is similar to the period of their expression measured in whole roots8 (Supplementary Data 2). Morning loop genes including CCA1 and LHY were oscillating in anti-phase to the evening loop gene TOC1 (indicated by vertical red lines in Fig. 2), indicating that we are observing a fully operating circadian clock in LR development.. It has been previously described that only the day loop is fully operating in Arabidopsis roots, synchronized by photosynthetic signals derived from the shoot circadian oscillator8. The most likely difference with our observations is due to different growth conditions. In the cited work, plants were grown hydroponically in light-tight boxes. Therefore, under constant light conditions, the leaves were in constant light but the roots were in constant darkness. In our experiments, both roots and leaves are exposed to constant light. Another difference is that whole roots were analysed8, whereas here we follow the development of LR primordia. When entrained in light-dark cycles the day-loop reporter TOC1:LUC oscillates in primary and lateral roots while in constant dark conditions waves of circadian oscillations travel from the root tip upwards22. This principle is very similar to that of a non-circadian oscillation of auxin responsive gene expression, such as ARF7, along the longitudinal axis of the root that determines the priming of LR primordia sites23. In contrast, here we investigate the establishment of fully operating circadian rhythms, including all evening loop components, and coordination of circadian signals as new LR primordia develop in growing roots.. . . The circadian clock rephases during LR development. The observed circadian oscillations in the LR data set can be explained by two different hypotheses: (H1) circadian oscillations in the root bend are initiated at germination24 or, (H2) the root gravitropic stimulus or LR primordium initiation rephases the circadian clock in the root bends, possibly independent of other tissues. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we applied a gravitropic stimulus to a TOC1:LUC reporter line, and monitored luminescence from germination onwards in continuous light conditions (Fig. 3a-e). When no gravitropic stimulus was applied, root tip and stem initially oscillated in phase, but oscillations dampened after 2 days in all parts of the root (Fig. 3b), while oscillations still persist in leaf and stem tissue (Fig. 3c). After gravity stimulation, robust oscillations became visible in the root bend and root tip tissues and persist over the course of the experiment. Regions above the bend still dampened quickly, similar to the control data in absence of a gravitropic stimulus. When comparing the region at which root bending occurs to the robustly rhythmic root tip, it appears that the bending initially triggers an earlier phase (1-3h) and also a longer periodicity, suggesting that this region at the root bend is behaving differently to other parts of the root tissue and other parts of the plant (Fig. 3d,e). However, 48h after gravity stimulation the phases of the root bend and root tip synchronize. This finding can be explained by recent data showing that the vascular tissues of cotyledons, where the circadian clock is distinct and more robust than in mesophyll tissues, can regulate gene expression as well as physiological responses in the neighbouring mesophyll tissue7. In the case of a root bend, 48h after gravity stimulation the new LR has emerged (Fig. 1b) and its vascular tissues have differentiated. We hypothesize that this maturation of the LR vascular tissues could explain the rephasing of the LR clock to the primary root clock. Irrespective, these data indicate that the LR circadian clock initially oscillates in a phase independent of the circadian clock of other root tissues.. To validate that the LR circadian clock does indeed oscillate in a phase independent of the circadian clock in other tissues, we conducted another experiment. Again, all seedlings were grown in continuous light conditions, without previous entrainment, consistent with the growth conditions in the previous experiments. To prove that both the morning and evening loops of the circadian clock rephase during LR development, we measured expression levels of the morning loop gene CCA1 in this experiment. In contrast to the microarray experiment (Fig. 1), all seedlings were dissected at the same age (same duration in the growth chamber), but gravity-stimulated at different ages post germination (Fig. 3f). From these plants, cotyledons, root bends, meristems and root sections above the bending region were dissected and CCA1 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR; Fig. 3g-j). If the gravistimulus did not change the circadian clock phase in the investigated tissue, one would expect a flat expression curve, as all samples would be harvested in the same phase of oscillation. However, if the gravistimulus leads to rephasing of the oscillator, one would observe CCA1 oscillations when plotting the data against time after gravitropic stimulus'. Our results reveal that CCA1 transcript abundance starts to oscillate in the root bend itself (Fig. 3g), while in the other sampled tissues (Fig. 3h-j) the mRNA profile of CCA1 was flat, confirming that the circadian clock rephases at the root bend after the gravitropic stimulus, independent of other plant tissues.. . . TOC1 is auxin-inducible during LR initiation. At the start of the LR time course, transcripts of the morning genes CCA1, LHY and PRR7 are low, whereas mRNAs of afternoon and evening expressed genes PRR5, PRR3, GI, TOC1, ELF3 and ELF4 are high (Fig. 2). The first significant changes in circadian clock transcript abundance are a rapid decline of TOC1 and GI versus a small increase in LHY mRNA abundance from 9h pgi (Fig. 2). All other circadian clock genes start to oscillate later (Fig. 2), suggesting that TOC1, GI and/or LHY genes regulate rephasing of circadian clock oscillations in LRs. This pattern of transcript abundance is similar in dry seeds before imbibition24, which is believed to synchronize and set the phase of the clock in Arabidopsis25. Since TOC1, GI and LHY are candidates for regulating circadian clock rephasing, and given that the plant hormone auxin triggers LR initiation, we investigated whether their expression is regulated by this hormone. Seedling roots were first treated with auxin (indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)) and then apical meristem and elongation zones (the latter containing the basal meristem from which new LR primordia originate) were microdissected, then the RNA isolated and profiled (as described for root bends). In the transcriptomic data generated using wild-type (WT) (Col-0) root material, TOC1 transcript abundance was rapidly induced nearly twofold 15min after auxin treatment in the basal meristem where LRs are primed (Fig. 4a), while in the root meristem the induction is nearly absent (Supplementary Fig. 3a). To validate this observation, we transcript profiled equivalent auxin-treated root zones in the arf7arf19 mutant (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 3a). ARF7 and ARF19 are two (of a total of five) auxin response (transcription activating) factors in Arabidopsis that are required for LR initiation since arf7arf19 mutants do not form LRs121516. As the auxin response pathway and LR development are disrupted in arf7arf19, we employed this double mutant background as a control for the auxin transcriptomic experiment. We observed that while ARF7 and ARF19 are not required for the initial rapid auxin-dependent upregulation of TOC1, they were essential for the maintenance of high TOC1 transcript levels (Fig. 4a). In contrast to TOC1 and LHY, root transcript abundance was not significantly changed by auxin (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). It has been demonstrated that high auxin concentrations can affect, but do not rephase the circadian clock26 and that pulses of CCA1 or LHY expression can shift the phase of circadian rhythms, but pulses of TOC1 expression do not27. In addition, TOC1 expression decreased after IAA treatment26. However, these observations were made in whole seedlings. As other major differences have been described for root and shoot circadian clock regulation8, we cannot rule out that this mechanism might be different in roots or LR primordia in particular. The observed auxin induction of TOC1 gene expression cannot be seen in other auxin and LR time course data sets28293031. However, the time points sampled do not have the resolution to pick up the rapid induction of TOC1 (within 15min). In addition, whole seedlings or whole roots were sampled for those data sets, most likely resulting in a dilution of TOC1 induction, which is specific to the root basal meristem. Based on this data, we suggest that auxin controls the induction and maintenance of TOC1 expression, representing a novel role for auxin in LR circadian clock regulation.. . . The circadian clock is required for LR development. To determine whether a fully operating circadian clock is required for normal LR development, we compared LR densities in single mutants and overexpressing lines of the three core circadian clock genes CCA1 (cca1-1, CCA1-OX), LHY (lhy-21, LHY-OX) and TOC1 (toc1-1, TOC1-OX) (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Figs 4a,c and 5b-e)323334. For phenotyping, all plants were grown in continuous light conditions, without previous entrainment, consistent with growth conditions from the previous experiments. The strongest reduction in emerged LR and LR primordium density was found in toc1-1, CCA1-OX and LHY-OX lines (between 30 and 60%), whereas other lines displayed weaker LR developmental phenotypes (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Figs 4b and 5b). While the absence of LR phenotypes in TOC1-OX and lhy-21 mutants seems puzzling on the first glance, a similar variety of phenotypic occurrence has been described for various other circadian clock-associated phenotypes. For example, CCA1-OX, LHY-OX, elf3, prr7 and prr9 exhibit long hypocotyl phenotypes, while the toc1-1 mutant does not335. Similar phenotypic discrepancies among circadian clock mutants have been shown in the control of flowering timing3. In addition, we attribute the phenotypic differences between these lines to toc1-1 being a semi-dominant missense allele (in its DNA-binding domain)36 that disrupts the mutant toc1-1 protein binding to promoters such as CCA1 to repress their expression4, while CCA1 and LHY overexpression has been reported to be able to reset the phase of the circadian clock27. To determine whether this phenotype arose as a result of a defect in LR initiation or development, we profiled the stages of LR primordia in 10-day-old seedlings in toc1-1, LHY-OX and CCA1-OX and compared them to their respective WTs. The proportion of toc1-1 LR primordia between stages I and IV was increased threefold compared with the WT control (C24, Fig. 4d), although the overall primordia density, including emerged LRs, was similar (Fig. 4c). LHY-OX lines also displayed a threefold increase in stage IV primordia (Supplementary Fig. 5c), but the overall primordia density was still lower than WT (Supplementary Fig. 5b). CCA1-OX lines did not display a strong LR primordium phenotype. These data suggest that disrupting the circadian clock leads to strong defects in LR development or emergence, but not initiation (Fig. 4b-d, Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). The transition from stage II to V is an important phase in LR development, since the Casparian strip, a tough lignified barrier that effectively ropes together endodermal cells overlying new LRs, needs to be broken to allow the new root organ to emerge37. Auxin is a key signal promoting LR emergence113839. This hormone is transported from newly initiated LR primordia towards cells in overlying tissues, where it triggers the expression of genes including its own influx carrier, LAX3, and the cell-wall remodelling enzyme polygalacturonase111440.. . . The LR circadian clock gates auxin levels and response. Given the LR development or emergence defects exhibited by mutant and overexpresser lines of core clock components, we examined whether the circadian clock may gate auxin signalling during LR development. We observed that 49 auxin-related genes display circadian oscillations during LR development under our experimental conditions21 (see Supplementary Data 3 for oscillating auxin-related genes). Among these auxin-related genes is IAA14 (Fig. 4e), which is a key regulator of LR initiation41 and emergence9. Significantly, expressing IAA14 under the regulation of the 35S promoter blocks LR emergence42. Hence, replacing the native IAA14 gene's oscillatory pattern (Fig. 4e) with a constitutive mode of expression in 35S::IAA14 transgenic seedlings disrupts LR emergence42. IAA14 functions as a transcriptional repressor that interacts directly with ARF7 and ARF19 proteins. Hence, regulating IAA14 expression in a circadian manner (Fig. 4e) would serve to gate the activity of the IAA14/ARF7/ARF19 auxin response module and their downstream genes that include direct targets LBD16 and LBD29 (refs 43, 44). Consistent with this model, LBD29, and to a lesser extent LBD16, are among the auxin-related genes whose mRNAs display circadian oscillations during LR development in our transcriptomic data set (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 3).. AtDAO2 (AT1G14120) represents another strongly circadian oscillating auxin-related mRNA (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Data 3). AtDAO2 is orthologous to the rice DAO enzyme mediating degradation of the major plant auxin IAA to its biologically inactive form oxIAA45. Metabolic profiling of root tissues revealed that oxIAA levels display strong circadian oscillations under free-running conditions (after initial entrainment for 2 days), and which increases during the subjective day coincident with elevated AtDAO2 transcript abundance (Fig. 4f). In parallel, free IAA levels oscillate in anti-phase with AtDAO2 and oxIAA (Fig. 4e,f). The circadian patterns of AtDAO2 and IAA levels (Fig. 4e,f) would lead to the gating of auxin-inducible gene expression such as IAA14 during root development. Moreover, the turnover of the IAA14 protein is also auxin dependent4647 creating further opportunities to gate auxin response activity during LR development. Indeed, slowing the auxin-dependent dynamics of IAA14 degradation was recently demonstrated to cause a quantitative reduction in LR emergence48.. AtDAO2 exhibits a circadian oscillation in transcript abundance similar to CCA1 but in anti-phase to TOC1 (Fig. 4e). AtDAO2 mRNA is initially induced one time step before CCA1, suggesting that its circadian expression pattern is not dependent on CCA1. The AtDAO2 promoter contains nine TOC1 (T1ME) binding motifs and TOC1 has recently been reported to be a transcriptional repressor4. In addition, AtDAO2 induction coincides with TOC1 transcript abundance dropping and vice versa, suggesting that AtDAO2 is negatively regulated by TOC1 (Fig. 4e). TOC1 functioning to directly repress AtDAO2 expression could explain why the toc1-1 mutant exhibits such a severe LR phenotype (Fig. 4b-d, Supplementary Fig. 4) since expression of many other auxin regulated genes (in addition to AtDOA2) would be uncoupled from the circadian clock..
PMC3913773	Results. . RabGAP22 is Required for Immunity to V. Longisporum. The white cabbage accession line BRA723 was previously identified as highly resistant to V. longisporum infection [19]. Hence, this material was selected for a cDNA-AFLP approach to further explore defense responses in this plant-pathogen system. A number of differentially expressed transcripts in roots during fungal interaction were detected. At two days post inoculation (dpi), 104 transcript-derived fragments were isolated and sequenced (Table S1). When comparing the sequences with the Arabidopsis database, 32 of the differentially expressed genes were identified as potential defense gene candidates. Out of these, the most strongly up-regulated transcript, RR86 (Accession number: KF258677), was further examined. BLASTP analysis identified four Arabidopsis genes homologous to RR86: At3g49350 (E=3e-1), At5g24390 (E=2e-05), At5g41940 (E=2e-05) and At5g53570 (E=5e-52), corresponding to the earlier classified RabGAP11, 19, 20 and 22, respectively [24]. Phylogenetic analysis on amino acid sequences from all 24 Arabidopsis RabGAPs and RR86 also placed RR86 in the same cluster as these four RabGAP genes (Figure 1A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0088187.g001. Figure 1. . Arabidopsis RabGAP22 is required for defense to V. longisporum..

Data represent means  SE (n=3 pools of 5 plants). Asterisk indicates significant difference to Col-0. (Students t-test; *p0.05; **p0.01; ***p0.001; ns=not significant).. . . . To determine if any of the four RabGAP gene candidates were linked to plant immunity, their corresponding Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants (Figure S1A) were investigated. None of these showed any difference in developmental phenotype compared to wild-type Col-0. When screened for responses to V. longisporum, the homozygous rabgap22-1 plants showed a clear susceptible phenotype (Figure 1B), whereas the rabgap11-1, rabgap19-1 and rabgap20-1 mutants displayed responses similar to that of wild-type (Figure S1b). To validate theses phenotypic responses quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyzes were performed. All T-DNA insertion mutant plants were found to be significantly down-regulated in their target genes (Figure S1C), and only the RabGAP22 gene was triggered by the fungus in wild-type Col-0 (Figure 1C). These results, together with complementation analysis using a RabGAP22Pro:RabGAP22 construct that restored the susceptible rabgap22-1 phenotype to the resistant wild-type phenotype (Figure 1B), demonstrated the importance of RabGAP22 in defense to V. longisporum. Fungal growth in the plant roots was also monitored using GFP-tagged V. longisporum. At 14 dpi, the fungus was detected in roots of both Col-0 and mutant plants. In agreement with the earlier results the degree of colonization was found to be significantly higher in rabgap22-1 and rabgap22-1 plants (Figures 1D, E).. . . RabGAP22 is Expressed in Vascular Tissues and Stomatal Guard Cells. In order to monitor the tissue and organ-specific expression of RabGAP22, transgenic Col-0 plants harboring a RabGAP22Pro:GUS construct were made. GUS-staining revealed expression throughout the plant, most strongly in root meristems, vascular tissues, stomata, trichomes and flower tissues such as style and receptacle (Figures 2A, B and S2A-G). This gene expression pattern was only very subtly changed at 2 and 6 days post V. longisporum inoculation (data not shown). We further searched for the subcellular localization of RabGAP22. No information could be acquired by TargetP [27] but the search tools MultiLoc2 [28] and AtSubP [29] suggested a nuclear localization. To clarify this, Nicotiana benthamiana plants were infiltrated with a RabGAP22Pro:RabGAP22-GFP construct, which demonstrated a nuclear localization of the RabGAP22-GFP protein (Figure 2C). This observation was further supported by co-infiltration of N. benthamiana leaves with RabGAP22Pro:RabGAP22-GFP and the nuclear marker VirD2NLS-YFP construct, showing a clear co-localization of the GFP and YFP signals in the nucleus (Figure 2C).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0088187.g002.

Reconstituted GFP signal was detected in the peroxisomes and was verified with a peroxisome-targeted mCherry marker (px-mCherry). Confocal images were taken 4 days post inoculation, using a Zeiss 780 confocal scanning microscope.. . . . . . RabGAP22 Interacts with the Photorespiratory Protein AGT1. To gain further insight into the function of RabGAP22 in plant immunity, we looked for potential interacting proteins under stress conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring 35SPro:RabGAP22-His were made, and immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-His antibodies were performed. In leaves from mock-treated plants, only the 60 kDa band corresponding to the RabGAP22-His protein was observed, whereas in leaf samples from V. longisporum soil-inoculated plants, a protein of 45 kDa co-precipitated with the RabGAP22-His protein (Figure S3A). The amino acid sequence of this new protein (Accession number: KF242188) was identified by MALDI-MS/MS as SERINE:GLYOXYLATE AMINOTRANSFERASE 1 (AGT1, At2g13360) (Figure S3B), an enzyme in the photorespiratory pathway [30]. An AGT1 homolog is known to be indispensable for appressorium function in the Magnaporthe oryzae fungus [31], thus we found it important to clarify if the identified AGT1 protein was of plant or fungal origin. When AGT1 protein sequences from V. longisporum, M. oryzae and Arabidopsis were aligned, the protein fragments from MALDI-MS/MS showed a perfect match to Arabidopsis AGT1 verifying a plant origin (Figure S3C). qRT-PCR analysis also revealed an increase in AGT1 transcript levels in roots of V. longisporum inoculated plants at 2 dpi (Figure S3D). To generate more data along this line, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay [32] was performed to show if interaction of the two proteins occurs in planta. Two plasmids, in which RabGAP22 and AGT1 were fused to the GFP C- and N-termini respectively (pSITE-cEGFP-RabGAP22 and pSITE-nEGFP-AGT1) were constructed and infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. A clear fluorescence signal was detected in the peroxisomes, demonstrating interaction of the two proteins (Figure 2D). The peroxisomal localization was further supported by co-infiltrations of the two BiFC constructs and a mCherry-tagged peroxisomal marker (Figure 2D). As a control step, the pSITE-cEGFP-RabGAP22 and pSITE-nEGFP-AGT1 plasmids were infiltrated individually into tobacco leaves to check for potential interactions, but no fluorescence signals were detected from those samples. The observed peroxisomal localization of RabGAP22-AGT1 was not unlikely, as AGT1 is a peroxisome-localized protein [33]. Presence of RabGAP22 in both nuclear and peroxisomal cellular compartments is also in line with the role of RabGAP proteins in vesicle trafficking between membrane compartments [34]. When tested for the response to V. longisporum, agt1 T-DNA insertions mutants showed a phenotype indistinguishable to that of Col-0 (Figure S3E), indicating that the immune response is mainly mediated by RabGAP22. The lack of a peroxisomal localization of RabGAP22-GFP in unstressed plants (Figure 2C) suggests that a specific re-localization of RabGAP22 to peroxisomes takes place under biotic stress conditions, here exemplified in response to V. longisporum. Changes in subcellular localization and activity of GTPases, GAPs and GEFs frequently occur in response to changes in the GTP/GDP-bound state [35] and also in response to phosphorylation of individual residues in these molecules [36]. The rice Rab protein OsRab11 is characterized both for regulating vesicular trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and vacuole [37], [38] and for interaction with the peroxisomal protein OsOPR8 [39].. Peroxisomal proteins are involved in a number of processes associated to pathogen defense responses, not least H2O2-production and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, reviewed by Srhagen et al. [40]. Consequently we assayed these responses in rabgap22-1 plants, starting with measurement of H2O2 levels by 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. The basal level of H2O2 was lower in the mutant compared to Col-0, and in contrast to the wild-type, no increase in the levels were detected in response to V. longisporum (Figures S3F, G). We interpreted the data as a very modest involvement of RabGAP22 in the H2O2 response, and instead initiated analysis of JA biosynthesis and signaling.. . . V. Longisporum Promotes Increased JA and JA-Ile Levels. Jasmonic acid (JA) and JA signaling play important roles in most plant defense systems, in particular in responses to necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens. To elucidate if the increased susceptibility of rabgap22-1 was linked to alterations in JA-mediated defense responses, endogenous levels of both JA and the bioactive JA-Isoleucine (JA-Ile) were measured at 2 dpi. As expected, both compounds increased in V. longisporum challenged Col-0 plants (Figure 3A, B). However, the levels of JA and JA-Ile were significantly higher in the rabgap22-1 mutant and strikingly induced by the fungus, indicating an important role of RabGAP22 in the JA biosynthesis pathway. In order to understand more on JA-associated events we analyzed transcript levels of key genes in the JA signaling pathway. The basal transcript levels of the repressor of JA-signaling JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN 10 (JAZ10) were 4-fold higher in rabgap22-1 compared to wild-type, but did not change upon fungal challenge (Figure 3C). Whereas levels of the JA signaling marker CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) only increased slightly in Col-0 in response to V. longisporum, elevated levels were seen in both mock and inoculated rabgap22-1 plants (Figure 3D). In agreement with previous reports [17], both the JA marker VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN 2 (VSP2) and the JA/ethylene marker PLANT DEFENSIN 1.2 (PDF1.2) were induced by V. longisporum in the wild-type (Figures 3E, F). In contrast, the induced levels of VSP2 in rabgap22-1 were lower compared to Col-0, whereas PDF1.2 levels appeared constitutively high in the mutant. Overall, our results indicate that RabGAP22 is a negative regulator of JA responses and that over-production of JA and JA-Ile in the rabgap22-1 mutant is accentuated during V. longisporum infection, contributing to a distorted JA defense signaling and an enhanced susceptible phenotype.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0088187.g003.

Asterisks indicate significant difference to the respective Col-0 mock treated control (Students t-test; *p0.05; **p0.01; ***p0.001).. . . . . . RabGAP22 is Involved in Brassinosteroid-associated Responses. To further expand our understanding of RabGAP22 defense responses, we searched for co-expressed genes. A comparative analysis of all available microarray datasets deposited in Genevestigator [41] was performed. The similarity search tool limited to perturbations for RabGAP22 showed MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE PHOSPHATASE (MPK1) and BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1) to be the two most correlated genes with a score of 0.59 and 0.56, respectively (Figure S4A). BAK1 is known to affect multiple processes, including brassinosteroid signaling and defense to plant pathogens [42], [43], [44]. Hence the bak1-4 Arabidopsis null mutant was challenged with V. longisporum to investigate its potential contribution in this pathosystem. The bak1-4 plants displayed a clear susceptible phenotype as well as a massive fungal colonization at 14 dpi compared to the wild-type (Figures 4A, B). In addition, BAK1Pro:GUS transgenic Arabidopsis plants displayed elevated levels of GUS expression in response to V. longisporum at 1 and 2 dpi (Figure S5). Further, the finding of attenuated levels of RabGAP22 in the bak1-4 mutant (Figure 4C) indicates that BAK1 may be required for RabGAP22 function.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0088187.g004. Figure 4. . BAK1 and brassinolide signaling are required for RabGAP22-mediated responses.. (A) Phenotypes of soil-grown plants 21 days post inoculation with V. longisporum. Whereas symptoms in wild-type Col-0 are mild, bak1-4 plants show strong symptoms (chlorosis, stunting and premature senescence) of V. longisporum infection.

Prior to fungal inoculation, plants were treated with either water or 24-epibrassinolide (BL) for two days. Data represent means  SE (n=3 pools of 5 plants). Asterisk indicates significant difference to Col-0. (Students t-test; *p0.05; **p0.01; ***p0.001).. . . . When our Genevestigator search was limited to hormone responses, brassinolide (BL) treatment was found to induce the highest RabGAP22 expression (Figure S4B). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are known to modulate plant defense responses and are involved in many other developmental processes including xylem differentiation [45], [46]. We therefore analyzed the responses to 24-epibrassinolide (BL) in our plant materials. No difference in the BL-induced root growth inhibition was found in rabgap22-1 compared to Col-0 plants grown in vitro, revealing that rabgap22-1 mutants were not compromised in the uptake of BL (data not shown). However when we pretreated plants with BL prior to V. longisporum inoculation, fungal colonization was reduced 4-fold in rabgap22-1 and 2-fold in wild-type (Figure 4D). Together these results suggest that the increased fungal colonization in rabgap22-1 is in part due to impaired BL signaling, and that RabGAP22 is a downstream component of BL-mediated signaling.. . . RabGAP22 Affects Stomata Closure through Attenuated ABA Levels. The observed RabGAP22Pro:GUS expression in guard cells (Figure 2B) resembles that of Arabidopsis ROP11 GTPase [47], a negative regulator of ABA-mediated stomatal closure. ABA is a central regulator of the stomatal apparatus [48], and Genevestigator expression data suggested a reduction in RabGAP22 expression in response to ABA treatment (Figure S4B). These features prompted us to test the behavior of stomata in response to V. longisporum challenge. At 14 dpi we found stomatal apertures in wild-type Col-0 to be reduced by 75% compared to mock treated plants. A feature that could explain the increased drought tolerance of V. longisporum inoculated Col-0 seen at a similar time-point [18]. At 14 dpi stomata were in contrast partially open (reduced by 34%) in the rabgap22-1 plants upon pathogen attack (Figure 5A). We wanted to know if this impairment in stomata closure could be linked to altered endogenous ABA levels in our plant materials. Congruent with previous findings [17] we detected a significant increase in ABA content in leaves of Col-0 in response to V. longisporum (Figure 5B), whereas the induction of ABA in the rabgap22-1 mutant only reached half the levels compared to the wild-type. These results were followed by a closer monitoring of the stomatal apparatus in Col-0 and rabgap22-1 plants in response to ABA treatment. No anomalies in size and numbers were found but stomata in rabgap22-1 were impaired in ABA-induced closure, with stomatal apertures only being reduced by 14% in response to the hormone application (Figure 5C). Based on the partial impaired stomatal closure in rabgap22-1 in response to V. longisporum, experiments were also run to clarify if a similar influence on the stomata apparatus could be seen in the well-studied Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 (Pst DC3000) system. When inoculated with Pst DC3000, leaves of rabgap22-1 plants showed a strong increase in bacterial proliferation compared to wild-type at 3 dpi (Figure 5D). PAMPs from Pst DC3000 are known to trigger stomatal closure in Arabidopsis within 1 to 2 h post inoculation through ABA biosynthesis and signaling [49], [50], [51], as well as via an ABA-independent oxylipin pathway [52]. The bacterial effector coronatine (COR) inhibits this effect by reopening the stomata within 3 to 4 h after infection. Treatment with flg22 (a PAMP of Pst DC3000) on our materials triggered stomatal closure in wild-type Col-0 plants as expected but this response was partially impaired in rabgap22-1 (Figure 5E). Stomatal apertures were also measured in Pst DC3000 inoculated plants, revealing at 1 hpi a weak, but significant reduction in the stomatal closure response of the rabgap22-1 plants (Figure 5F). At 4 hpi, stomatal apertures in both Col-0 and rabgap22-1 were again open indicating that COR-mediated re-opening of stomata was not effected in the mutant. That the stomatal closure responses to flg22 and Pst DC3000 were not as strong as those for V. longisporum, could be attributed to involvement of additional defense components in the case of this leaf pathogen.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0088187.g005.

PMC3295387	Results. . Structure and topology of OEP16 in the outer envelope membrane of plastids. For isolation of Ps-OEP16.2, degenerated oligonucleotide primers were used to PCR-amplify a fragment on pea leaf cDNA. Subsequently, a cDNA, which contained an 546 bp long open reading frame as well as a 5 untranslated region (UTR; 121 bp) and a 3UTR (150 bp), was identified by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends)-PCR (GenBank accession no. JN859826). The corresponding Ps-OEP16.2 protein is 183 amino acids long (Fig. 1A) and has a predicted molecular mass of 19.2 kDa. When compared with the Arabidopsis orthologue At-OEP16.2 (179 amino acids, 18.8 kDa), Ps-OEP16.2 shows 58% amino acid identity (Fig. 1B), while the closest relative can be found in M. truncatula (GenBank accession no. BI312211, 86% identity with Ps-OEP16.2). As defined for Ps-OEP16.1 (Linke et al., 2004) and described for all members of the PRAT superfamily (Murcha et al., 2007; Pudelski et al., 2010), four membrane-spanning alpha-helical domains are likely for Ps-OEP16.2 (Fig. 1A, C). Further, Ps-OEP16.2 contains an extended interhelical loop region between the first and second membrane helix, which is believed to be specifically conserved and inherited throughout evolution of angiosperm seed plants and therefore designated as the S-domain (Drea et al., 2006).. . Fig. 1.. . Structure and membrane topology of OEP16 proteins. (A) Amino acid sequence alignment of OEP16 isoforms from Arabidopsis and pea. Bars indicate the positions of the four membrane-spanning alpha-helices as defined for Ps-OEP16.1 (Linke et al., 2004). Identical and similar amino acids shared by all (100%), three or more (60%), and two (40%) of the sequences are shaded in black, dark grey, and light grey, respectively. (B) Percentage of identical amino acids between the proteins aligned in A. Identities among distinct OEP16.1 and OEP16.2 isoforms of different species are >58% (dark grey squares). (C) Topology model of OEP16 proteins in the outer envelope membrane (OE) of plastids. alpha-Helical membrane domains (cylinders) are depicted as defined for Ps-OEP16.1 (Linke et al., 2004). Please note that only the N-terminus and the extended interhelical loop region between the first and second helix (compare with alignment in A), which defines the S-domain of OEP16.2 (Drea et al., 2006), most probably are not embedded in the lipid bilayer environment. Cyt, cytosol; ims, intermembrane space.. . . . Generation of a specific antibody against Ps-OEP16.2 allowed localization of the 19 kDa protein in outer envelope membranes of very young chloroplasts from pea seedlings (Fig. 2A). By protease treatment of these envelope vesicles and subsequent immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2B), it was possible to determine the orientation of OEP16.1 and OEP16.2 proteins within the membrane (see Fig. 1C). In general, it has been shown that purified outer envelope membranes from isolated pea chloroplasts form vesicles with right-side-out orientation (Keegstra and Youssif 1986; Waegemann et al., 1992). Thus, the protease thermolysin is able to proteolyse only those peptide stretches which are exposed to the cytosol (i.e. at the outside of the envelope vesicles). The proteolytic pattern of the control protein OEP37 (Schleiff et al., 2003) confirmed vesicle orientation and protease function (Fig. 2B). Thermolysin treatment of Ps-OEP16.2 produced two distinct protein fragments that were 2.5 kDa and 3 kDa smaller than the signal of untreated samples (19 kDa). Since Ps-OEP16.1 showed a similar proteolytic pattern, it can be concluded that the N- and C-terminus of OEP16.1 and OEP16.2 point to the outer face of the vesicles, which means in vivo to the cytosol. Because the C-terminus of both proteins directly ends with the fourth membrane helix, thermolysin can only cut at the N-terminal end, which is 3.1 kDa for Ps-OEP16.2 and 2.4 kDa for Ps-OEP16.1 (compare Fig. 1A and C). The interhelical loop region between the second and third helix is very short (10 amino acids) and thus most probably was not be accessible to the protease. Experiments on isolated intact Arabidopsis chloroplasts (Li and Philippar, unpublished results) displayed the same pattern for At-OEP16.1 and confirmed results for pea envelopes. In general, both alpha-helical OEP16 proteins are tightly folded, which is indicated by their resistance to proteolysis even when membranes were solubilized by Triton (Fig. 2B). In particular, the thermolysin fragment of Ps-OEP16.1 that lacks the N-terminus was extraordinarily stable. Ps-OEP16.2 was somewhat less protease resistant than Ps-OEP16.1, probably due to the extended, interhelical S-domain between the first and second helix (compare Fig. 1). However, a beta-barrel protein like OEP37 with several larger soluble loop regions (compare Schleiff et al., 2003) was proteolysed into many more fragments, which were further degraded when membranes were solubilized by detergent (Fig. 2B).. . Fig. 2.. . Localization of OEP16.1 and OEP16.2 in the plastid outer envelope membrane. For immunodetection of OEP16.2, envelope membranes were prepared from isolated chloroplasts of 7-day-old pea seedlings (all others: 10-day-old plants). Numbers indicate the molecular mass of proteins in kDa. (A) Immunoblot analysis of Ps-OEP16.1 and Ps-OEP16.2 in purified outer (OE) and inner (IE) envelope membranes from pea chloroplasts. Antisera against the proteins Ps-OEP37 (OE) and PIC1 (IE) were used as controls. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded per lane: for detection of OEP37, 5 mug; for PIC1, 20 mug; for OEP16.2, 30 mug; and for OEP16.1, 1 mug. (B) Outer envelope membrane vesicles from pea chloroplasts were protease digested with thermolysin (thl) and subsequently subjected to immunblot analysis for Ps-OEP16.2, Ps-OEP16.1, and Ps-OEP37. Thermolysin was incubated for 0-45 min in a 2:1 ratio (w/w) per mug of envelope proteins. To solubilize membranes, 1% Triton (+thl/tri) was added in control assays. For detection of OEP16.2 (upper panel) 90 mug, and for OEP16.1 (lower panel) and OEP37 (right panel) 2.5 mug of protein were loaded equally in each lane. Arrowheads indicate major digestion fragments. For the control OEP37, fragment sizes correspond to those detected by Schleiff et al. (2003).. . . . In summary, the data demonstrate that the N- and C-termini of the membrane-integral proteins OEP16.1 and OEP16.2 in the plastid outer envelope are localized in the cytosol. The OEP16.2-specific interhelical S-domain points to the intermembrane space (see Fig. 1C).. . . Specific expression of OEP16 isoforms during seed development and germination. Public microarray data sets of Arabidopsis development (Honys and Twell, 2003; Schmid et al., 2005) confirmed that OEP16.1 is the major leaf and stem isoform, while OEP16.2 is expressed strongly and exclusively in embryos, seeds, and pollen tissue (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). OEP16.4 transcripts can be found ubiquitously, but at a low level-usually about >4 times less than OEP16.1 and/or OEP16.2. In roots, OEP16.1 and OEP16.4 transcripts are present in equal but low amounts (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Of particular interest, however, was the strict regulation of OEP16.2 expression. After seed germination is completed, OEP16.2 is absent in leaves, roots, and stems of all developmental stages. In mature plants, transcripts first appear in flowers, where expression is restricted to stamen and pollen grains, and peaks in early pollen development (Supplementary Fig. S2B, S2C). In addition, elevated expression of OEP16.2 in pollen was confirmed by promoter-GUS studies (not shown, and Drea et al., 2006) and identification of the protein in Arabidopsis pollen proteome mapping (Holmes-Davis et al., 2005).. To follow the OEP16 expression pattern and protein levels during seed development and germination, At-OEP16.1 and At-OEP16.2 promoter-GUS signals were studied and immunoblot analysis was performed on Arabidopsis tissues (Fig. 3A, B). Interestingly, OEP16.1 and OEP16.2 show alternating and complementing expression patterns. Whereas OEP16.1 is present until torpedo stage embryos, resumes in cotyledons, and is highest in the first true leaves of the seedling, OEP16.2 fills the gap in late embryonic stages, and peaks in embryos of dry and germinating seeds. Further, OEP16.2 promoter activity was detectable in early cotyledon/hypocotyl tissue and the germinating root tip. Thus, a previous analysis on alternating protein levels of OEP16 isoforms in seedlings (OEP16.1 in first true leaves, OEP16.2 in cotyledons; compare Philippar et al., 2007) could be confirmed and this principle could be expanded for seed development and germination. In addition, the same complementary OEP16.1/OEP16.2 pattern was detected in dissected developing pea seeds, where weak signals of Ps-OEP16.1 proteins are found in early embryo and seed coats, but Ps-OEP16.2 was restricted to late embryos and was highest in dry seeds (Fig. 3C).. . Fig. 3.. . OEP16.1 and OEP16.2 expression during seed development and germination. (A) Histochemical detection of GUS activity directed by the At-OEP16.1 and At-OEP16.2 promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. GUS expression was monitored after germination for 1, 3, 5, and 11 d. For the 1-day-old tissue (1d) the seed coat was removed manually. Pictures show representative results for at least three different transgenic lines. (B) Immunoblot analysis of At-OEP16.1 and At-OEP16.2 in protein extracts from developing seeds (tr/he, transition/heart stage; to/em, torpedo/embryo stage), dry seeds, cotyledons (1-5 d old), and leaves (11 d old) of seedlings. For seeds 10 mug, and for seedlings 20 mug of protein were loaded in each lane. (C) Immunoblot of Ps-OEP16.2 and Ps-OEP16.1 in protein extracts (4 mug each) from developing and dry (ds) pea seeds. Seed stages are given in days after pollination (dap). During development seeds were separated into embryo (e) and seed coat (c) tissue, the latter containing endosperm layers. Asterisks indicate weak OEP16.1 signals in early embryo and seed coat (15 dap). (B and C) Antiserum against the marker protein VDAC (outer membrane of mitochondria) was used as loading control. Numbers indicate the molecular mass of proteins in kDa.. . . . Publicly available Arabidopsis transcript data sets of seed development (Schmid et al., 2005) and laser capture microdissected seed organs (Harada-Goldberg Arabidopsis microarrays: Gene Networks in Seed Development) allowed further insight into the seed-specific expression pattern of OEP16 isoforms (Fig. 4). Here OEP16.2 expression constantly increases during seed maturation and peaks in late stages when desiccation tolerance and dormancy are acquired (Fig. 4A). OEP16.2 transcripts are exceptionally high during the late desiccation phase, confirming the high protein levels found in dry seeds (compare Fig. 3B and C). Further dissected seed and embryo organs revealed that OEP16.2 transcripts exclusively locate to the embryo and endosperm of mature seeds (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). Because the transition from the phase of reserve accumulation to seed desiccation is accompanied by a distinct switch in gene expression and accumulation of specific free metabolites (Angelovici et al., 2010), two genes were selected from the microarray study by Angelovici et al. (2009) as transcriptional markers for this maturation-desiccation switch: At4g21960, encoding a peroxidase (PRXR1) and up-regulated in late maturation stages but down-regulated upon desiccation, and At2g41280, similar to late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and expressed only during the seed desiccation phase (see Fig. 4A). In comparison with these two marker genes, OEP16.2 followed the expression pattern of At2g4128, and thus groups to the LEA genes, which are up-regulated during desiccation only. In contrast, OEP16.1 mRNA is increased in early stages of embryo morphogenesis and drops upon seed maturation (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, strong OEP16.1 expression in early morphogenesis is associated with the maternally derived seed coat, but in mature seeds OEP16.1 is present in all seed compartments at a lower level (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S3). OEP16.4 transcripts, however, are 30-40 times less than those for OEP16.1 in seed coats of heart stage embryos or for OEP16.2 in embryos of mature seeds. In the latter, OEP16.4 is restricted to endosperm and seed coat (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S3).. . Fig. 4.. . OEP16 expression profiles during Arabidopsis seed development. Data used to create the digital northern blots were obtained from the respective experiments deposited at the NASCArrays website (http://affy.arabidopsis.info/narrays/experimentbrowse.pl) and from the Harada-Goldberg Arabidopsis miccoarray data set of laser capture microdissected seeds (Gene Networks in Seed Development at http://estdb.biology.ucla.edu/seed/). Mean signal intensities (arbitrary units SD) were averaged from 2-3 replicates. Morphogenesis, reserve accumulation, and desiccation/dormancy phases are indicated by white, light grey, and dark grey background, respectively. (A) Embryo and seed development (AtGenExpress siliques and seeds, NASCARRAYS-154). The seed stages 3-10 are defined according to embryo development as follows: 3, mid-globular to early heart; 4, early heart to late heart; 5, late heart to mid-torpedo; 6, mid-torpedo to late torpedo; 7, late torpedo to early walking stick; 8, walking stick to early curled cotyledons; 9, curled cotyledons to early green cotyledons; 10, green cotyledons. Note that the seed stages 3-5 include silique tissue. Signals for At-OEP16.1 (green) and for At-OEP16.4 (blue) correspond to the right y-axis, while the left y-axis was scaled for At-OEP16.2 (orange) and the controls PRXR1 (dots) and LEA-like (triangles). Differential expression of the latter two genes defines the transcriptional switch from reserve accumulation to the acquirement of desiccation tolerance and dormancy. (B) Tissue-specific expression pattern of OEP16 isoforms in pre-globular, heart, torpedo, and mature seed stages (Harada-Goldberg Arabidopsis LCM Gene-Chip Data Set). Different tissues are defined as follows: CZE, chalazal endosperm; CZSC, chalazal seed coat; EP, embryo proper; GSC, general seed coat; MCE, micropylar endosperm; PEN, peripheral endosperm; S, suspensor. Signal values (arbitrary units) for At-OEP16.1 (green), At-OEP16.2 (orange), and At-OEP16.4 (blue) are presented in tissues with the highest expression (for complete data sets see Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). Seed tissues are coloured according to transcript density for signals that are absent (white), insufficient (blue), <500 (beige), 500-5000 (orange), 5000-10 000 (purple), and >10 000 (dark red).. . . . Because in the analysis of pea seeds (Fig. 3C) prepared seed coats contained attached endosperm layers, OEP16 expression could not be distinguished between maternal seed coat and filial endosperm. However, expression profiles of OEP16 orthologues in dissected soybean seeds (Harada-Goldberg data set of Glycine max microarrays: Gene Networks in Seed Development) allowed comparison of the two legumes and Arabidopsis. As found in pea and Arabidopsis, the OEP16.1 isoform in soybean is highly expressed in seed coat, endosperm, and embryo tissues of early (globular) and late maturation stages, whereas OEP16.2 again is restricted to filial compartments (endosperm/cotyledons and embryo) in the mature seed only (Supplementary Fig. S4, at JXB online). OEP16.2 thereby can be unequivocally allocated to those proteins associated with the seed desiccation process, which are specifically expressed during late embryogenesis, in dry seeds, and during early germination. These findings are further substantiated since At-OEP16.2 represents one of the most abundant mRNAs, which are stored in dry seeds for subsequent germination (Nakabayashi et al., 2005).. As a summary of all expression data, OEP16.2 function appears to be closely linked to desiccation-tolerant grain tissues, which are represented by pollen and in particular seeds, where OEP16.2 is restricted to filial embryo and endosperm. Further, OEP16.2 appears to provide a functional link for bridging the dormant and desiccation-tolerant status during seed maturation and the germination potential of mature seeds. In contrast, a corresponding role might be performed by OEP16.1 during maternally controlled early morphogenesis events and by accompanying reserve accumulation in the seed coat, endosperm, and embryo.. . . Specific control of OEP16.2 expression by the phytohormone ABA in seeds. Since OEP16.2 expression specifically correlates with seed desiccation and dormancy processes controlled by the phytohormone ABA, OEP16 transcript and protein content was monitored in germinating Arabidopsis seeds that were treated with ABA. In the analysis by Penfield et al. (2004), At-OEP16.2 transcripts were specifically and strongly increased upon germination for 24 h in the presence of ABA (Fig. 5A). In endosperm tissue, the induction was 5-fold, and in embryos even 9-fold. In contrast, At-OEP16.1 and At-OEP16.4 were not regulated in endosperm but responded slightly to ABA in embryos, showing 2-fold down-regulation (OEP16.1) and 2-fold up-regulation (OEP16.4). When testing for protein levels, it was found that after 48 h of ABA treatment during germination, OEP16.2 protein content also substantially increased (Fig. 5B).. . Fig. 5.. . Specific ABA induction of OEP16.2 expression in seeds. (A) Digital northern blot of At-OEP16.2 (black), At-OEP16.1 (grey), and At-OEP16.4 (white) expression (arbitrary units) in Arabidopsis endosperm and embryo tissue. Prior to dissection, seeds were germinated for 24 h without (0) and with 20 muM ABA (described in Penfield et al., 2004). Data used to create the expression profile were obtained from the analysis by Penfield et al. (2004) using NASCArrays database (http://affy.arabidopsis.info/narrays/experimentbrowse.pl), experiment NASCARRAYS 386. Signal intensities were averaged from three biological replicates (n=3, SD). (B) Western blot analysis of At-OEP16.2 in protein extracts (7.5 mug each) from Arabidopsis seeds, germinated for 48 h on medium containing 0, 2.5, and 20 muM ABA. (C) Transcript content of Ps-OEP16.2 (n=2, SD, arbitrary units) in developing pea seeds of the wild type (black) and the Vf-SnRK1-antisense line snf34 (white). The age of seeds is given in days after pollination (dap). According to the definition by Radchuk et al. (2006), delayed down-regulated genes are highly expressed in the pre-storage phase 13-15 dap (light grey area), and delayed up-regulated genes are continuously increased during seed maturation, starting in the transition phase at 19-22 dap (dark grey area). (D) Immunoblot analysis of Ps-OEP16.2 in protein extracts (4 mug each) from wild-type and VfSnRK1-antisense (snf34) pea seeds, isolated 20 dap. (B and D) Antiserum against the marker protein VDAC (outer membrane of mitochondria) was used as a loading control. Numbers indicate the molecular mass of proteins in kDa.. . . . Isolation of the cDNA sequence of OEP16.2 from pea further allowed tracking of Ps-OEP16.2 expression in several studies during pea seed development. By analysis of embryos from antisense lines with decreased expression of sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase (SnRK1), the expressed sequence tag (EST) for Ps-OEP16.2 (PSC23A24, table II in Radchuk et al., 2006) was found to be grouped to those genes that showed a delayed up-regulation in the transition stage of seed development. In wild-type embryos Ps-OEP16.2 transcripts strongly accumulated during the transition phase 19-22 days after pollination (dap; 10-fold when 21 dap are compared with 15 dap; Fig. 5C). As described for Arabidopsis (see above), this transition state during pea seed maturation is associated with a transcriptional and metabolic switch (Radchuk et al., 2006, and references therein). Interestingly, in SnRK1 antisense seeds of line snf34 (corresponding to Vic-34 in Radchuk et al., 2006), Ps-OEP16.2 up-regulation was absent (Fig. 5C), reflecting the fact that SnRK1 antisense seeds contain reduced levels of ABA (Radchuk et al., 2010b). When regulation on the protein level (Fig. 5D) was tested, it was found that compared with the wild type, snf34 embryos at 20 dap contain only 70% Ps-OEP16.2 proteins (73.912.6%, n=3, SD). Further, ABA control of Ps-OEP16.2 expression in pea seeds was confirmed by decreased transcripts in embryos with reduced levels of free ABA, which were generated by immuno modulation (anti-ABA seeds, see table 1 in Radchuk et al., 2010a). With 69.8210.05% (n=4, SD) of wild-type OEP16.2 proteins, the decrease in anti-ABA embryos at 22 dap was in the same range as for SnRK1 antisense lines.. In conclusion, OEP16.2 expression during late seed development and early germination is specifically controlled and strongly stimulated by the dormancy and desiccation tolerance-inducing hormone ABA.. . . Loss of OEP16 proteins provokes ABA hypersensitivity during seed germination. To document the function of OEP16 proteins during seed development and germination, all combinations of oep16 triple and double knockout mutants were generated in Arabidopsis. Therefore, the double mutant oep16.1-1/oep16.4-2 was crossed with the single mutant oep16.2-1, both representing knockout lines for At-OEP16.1, At-OEP16.4, and At-OEP16.2, respectively (Philippar et al., 2007). In the F3 generation of the crossed lines, the homozygous oep16 triple mutant (1/2/4), a corresponding triple wild-type line (wt), and the respective double mutants 1/2, 1/4, and 2/4 were segregated (for details, see the Materials and methods). The loss of the respective OEP16 isoforms was documented on the transcript as well as on the protein level (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). Because OEP16.1 and OEP16.2 function is most probably implicated in seed development and germination, mutants were analysed for visible defects during these processes. What was found was, that in comparison with wild-type plants, none of the oep16 knockout mutants showed a phenotype during germination, growth, and development under standard conditions (compare also Philippar et al., 2007; Pudelski et al., 2009), or any macroscopic defects of embryo and seed maturation (e.g. arrested or distorted embryos, smaller siliques, or differences in seed weight or amount).. However, when mutant seeds were germinated in the presence of ABA, the oep16 triple mutant displayed ABA hypersensitivity that was characterized by delayed germination when compared with the corresponding wild-type seeds (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online). Whereas without ABA, germination rates of all seeds analysed were similar, upon ABA addition it took 24 h longer to reach the same number of germinated seeds in the oep16 triple mutant than in the wild type. When seeds were germinated on agar containing 2.5 muM ABA, this delay was maximal after 72 h (Supplementary Fig. S5). Further, germination rates of oep16 double mutants after 72 h incubation with ABA (Supplementary Fig. S5) and germination tests with the single mutant lines (not shown) demonstrated that most probably the loss of OEP16.2 has the strongest effect on ABA-hypersensitive seed germination. However, in all experiments, the ABA-controlled germination delay was strongest in subsequent generations of the oep16 triple mutant. The triple mutant and the corresponding wild type were therefore chosen for all further experiments and analysis of metabolic signatures during ABA-controlled germination. Therefore, seeds were germinated on nylon filters in the presence of 1 muM ABA (Fig. 6A). When compared with experiments on agar, seed germination on nylon filters in general and in the presence of ABA was delayed by 12 h and 48 h, respectively (compare Supplementary Fig. S5). However, ABA hypersensitivity of the oep16 triple mutant could be confirmed to appear in a time window between 3 d and 6 d and again revealed an ABA-induced germination delay of 24 h. Parallel immunoblot analysis in addition showed that expression of OEP16.2 proteins disappeared 3 d after germination, while upon ABA addition high OEP16.2 levels were maintained throughout the germination process (Fig. 6B). In contrast, expression of OEP16.1, which was initiated 3 d after germination, was not responsive to ABA.. . Fig. 6.. . ABA hypersensitivity during germination of OEP16 triple mutants. (A) Germination rates of oep16 triple mutant (1/2/4, triangles) and corresponding wild-type seeds (circles). Seed germination on nylon filters was followed for 168 h in the absence and presence of 1 muM ABA (open and filled symbols, respectively). Data represent mean values SE of n=4 independent experiments. (B) Immunoblot analysis of At-OEP16.2 (upper panel) and At-OEP16.1 (lower panel) in protein extracts (25 mug each) from wild-type Arabidopsis seeds, germinated as described in A. Numbers indicate the molecular mass of proteins in kDa. (-), no ABA; (+), addition of 1 muM ABA.. . . . Thus, ABA hypersensitivity of germinating oep16 mutant seeds is most probably due to the loss of the ABA-induced isoform OEP16.2, which is predominant during seed maturation, in dry seeds, and in early germination. It cannot, however, be excluded that the lack of OEP16.1 and OEP16.4 in the triple mutant might have additional effects on germination as well.. . . Developing and germinating seeds of the oep16.1/2/4 mutant show changes in metabolic signatures. To analyse the impact of OEP16 on the content of seed metabolites, amino acids and sugars in oep16 triple mutants and the corresponding wild type were determined during maturation and germination of seeds (Fig. 7; Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online). In general, free amino acids during late maturation (Fig. 7A) were at a high level, decreased in dry seeds (Fig. 7B), and increased again after initiation of germination by 24 h imbibition (Fig. 7C). Glycine, however, behaved in the opposite manner and was highest in dry seeds. During seed development, the oep16 triple mutant was characterized by a significant increase in amino acids when compared with the wild type: asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), threonine (Thr), valine (Val), histidine (His), isoleucine (Ile), and lysine (Lys) in maturing seeds; aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), Asn, Thr, arginine (Arg), Val, Lys, and phenylalanine (Phe) in dry seeds (Fig. 7A, B). Interestingly, this switched to a decrease in oep16.1/2/4 when seeds were germinated [Arg, proline (Pro), Val, tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), Ile, Lys, leucine (Leu), and Phe; Fig. 7C]. The only exception was Met, which was lower in the oep16 triple mutant in all three stages analysed. However, although statistically significant, the latter reduction was only marginal (1.2- to 1.4-fold). Major changes in amino acids of the oep16 triple mutant were found for Asn, Gln, and Thr in maturing seeds as well as for Asp, Asn, Thr, and Arg in dry seeds (2.2-, 1.5-, 1.6-, and 1.8-, 2.6-, 1.7-, and 2.8-fold increase, respectively; see Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, in imbibed seeds, the decrease of Val (1.5), Ile (2.2), Lys (1.8), Leu (1.9), and Phen (1.6) was >1.5-fold.. . Fig. 7.. . Amino acid and sugar content during seed maturation of the oep16 triple mutant and wild type. Metabolites were determined in maturing seeds (ms), dry seeds (ds), and seeds imbibed for 24 h (s24) of the oep16.1/2/4 triple mutant and corresponding wild type (black and white bars, respectively). Maturing seeds correspond to stages 7-10 as depicted in Fig. 4A. Data represent mean values of independent biological replicates (n=3-4, SD). Please note that while concentrations for maturing seeds are given per gram of tissue fresh weight (FW), they are related to dry weight (DW) for dry and imbibed seeds. Significance analysis was performed by a Students t-test with P-values <0.05 (*); <0.01 (**); and <0.005 (***), respectively. For complete data sets see Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online. (A-C) Amino acid concentration (nmol/g FW or DW). Tryptophan and cysteine were not determined. (D) Glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch (mumol/g FW or DW). Fructose values in dry seeds were below the detection limit (bdl) of the analysis. For starch, the right y-axis is scaled for concentrations in dry and imbibed seeds.. . . . As expected, glucose and sucrose, which have to be mobilized for subsequent germination, accumulated in dry seeds of the mutant and wild type. In contrast, starch breakdown occurred during seed desiccation and thus starch content was highest in late seed maturation (Fig. 7D). Differences in sugar content between the oep16.1/2/4 mutant and the wild type were observed in dry seeds, whereas in the oep16 triple mutant glucose levels were increased 1.65-fold and sucrose and starch decreased by 1.2- and 3.2-fold, respectively. Further, in imbibed mutant seeds, sucrose content was still 1.5-fold less than in the wild type (Fig. 7D; Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online).. To follow metabolic changes introduced by the observed ABA hypersensitivity of the oep16 triple mutant, amino acids and sugars were analysed in 6-day-old seedlings grown in the absence and presence of 1 muM ABA (Fig. 8; Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online). When oep16 triple mutant seeds were germinated for 6 d, amino acid differences from the wild type that were detected in dry seeds and early germination were almost compensated, except for a 1.2-fold increase in Gln (Fig. 8A). In contrast, in the presence of ABA, down-regulation of amino acids was observed in oep16 triple mutant seedlings (Fig. 8B). Here Asp, serine (Ser), His, Thr, and Pro were slightly decreased (fold change <1.4) and Lys was down-regulated more pronouncedly (1.8-fold). Thus, with respect to down-regulation of amino acids in the OEP16.1/2/4 mutant, ABA addition to seedlings seems to mimic the status of early germinating, imbibed seeds (compare Fig. 7C, Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online). ABA addition to wild-type and mutant seedlings in general induced an increase in Asp, Glu, Arg, Ala, Pro, Val, and Met, and a decrease in Asn, Ser, Gln, Gly, His, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), Thr, Lys, and Phe, while only Ile and Leu remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online). Except for Ile (slight decrease in mutants) this behaviour was the same for wild type and the oep16 triple mutant.. . Fig. 8.. . Amino acid and sugar content of oep16 triple mutant and wild-type seedlings. (A and B) Amino acid concentrations (nmolg FW, n=3-4 SD) in 6-day-old seedlings of the oep16 triple mutant (1/2/4, black bars) and wild type (white bars). Seedlings were grown on nylon filters in the absence (A) and presence of 1 muM ABA (B). Tryptophan and cysteine were not determined. (C) Glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch concentrations (mumol/g FW, n=3-4, SD) in seedling tissue described in A and B. Significance analysis was performed by a Students t-test with P-values <0.05 (*); <0.01 (**); and <0.005 (***), respectively. For complete data sets see Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online.. . . . After growth for 6 d in the absence of ABA, significant differences in glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch were not observed (Fig. 8C). However, as found in dry seeds, in the presence of ABA the starch content in the oep16 triple mutant dropped quite drastically (3.3-fold decrease), but sucrose increased slightly (1.2-fold). In general, dry seeds contained 2-fold more glucose and 10-fold more sucrose than 6-day-old seedlings. ABA addition during germination induced an overall increase in sugars (5-fold for glucose, sucrose, and starch, and 50-fold for fructose).. In summary, the largest difference for the oep16.1/2/4 mutant compared with the wild type in amino acid and sugar content was found in dry seeds. Whereas from seed maturation to desiccation the mutant is characterized by an increase in amino acids, a switch to decreased amino acids was detected during early germination and a compensation of metabolic differences was revealed after prolonged seedling growth. However, when ABA is present, down-regulation of amino acids and starch is sustained in mutant seedlings, thus mimicking the status of dry seeds..
PMC5231383	Results. . Isolation and characterization of BnLATE in B. napus. Using a Brassica 90K Oligo Array (Combimatrix), we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of the main inflorescences of two B. napus accessions, ZS11 and 73290, and identified a differentially expressed probe (MI7092; the expression ratio of ZS11 vs. 73290 was 4.4) corresponding to a cDNA (EST, GenBank accession No. EE445734) with homology to A. thaliana LATE FLOWERING (AtLATE) [34]. The full-length ORF (513 bp) of this probe in both ZS11 and 73290 were isolated and sequenced, and both sequences were found to be identical to each other. With 76% amino acid identity to AtLATE (Fig 1), this ORF was thereby named BnLATE. Moreover, sequence comparison showed that rapeseed contained six BnLATE homologues named BnaA02g30480D, BnaA06g39620D, BnaA09g03180D, BnaC02g38810D, BnaC07g26830D, and BnaC09g02610D, which were located in the A genome (A02, A06, and A09 chromosomes) and the C genome (C02, C07, and C09 chromosomes) respectively, based on the genome sequence of rapeseed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000686985.1/) (Fig 1).

Amino acid sequence alignment of BnLATE and Arabidopsis LATE.. The C2H2 zinc-finger domain, LDLXL domain, and B-box indicated by solid black, dotted black, and dotted red boxes, respectively. Numbers in parentheses indicate the amino acid position in each protein.. . . . In silico analysis indicated that BnLATE encodes an intron-less zinc-finger protein transcription factor that consists of 171 amino acids, including three conserved domains, namely a C2H2 zinc-finger domain, B-box domain, and LDLXL domain (Fig 1). The evolutionary relationship between BnLATE and 10 well-known zinc-finger family genes in Arabidopsis was evaluated by phylogenetic analysis using the unrooted neighbor-joining (NJ) method, and these genes were grouped into two distinct clades (Fig 2A). The number of zinc-finger domains differed in each gene, and three conserved domains detected in BnLATE were identified in all clade I and II proteins (Fig 2B). Besides the three conserved domains, two other C2H2-like zinc-finger domains (consensus sequence CX2CXKXFXSXQALGGHX3H, CX2CX3FXSX2ALGGHX3H, respectively) and an L-box domain were only present in the N-terminal of clade II proteins (Fig 2B and 2C), and the functions were unknown [35, 36].. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0168046.g002.

(C) Conserved motif models identified with MEME procedure among members of LATE family from B. napus and Arabidopsis. Motifs 1, 2, and 4 are zinc finger domain, motifs 3, 5, and 6 are L-box, EAR-like domain, and B-box respectively.. . . . . . BnLATE is specifically expressed in the yellowing silique wall. To analyze the temporal and spatial expression pattern of BnLATE in B. napus, we isolated and sequenced the BnLATE promoters (849 bp) from 73290 using genome walking PCR. Within the 849 bp sequences, a TATA box and a CAAT box, which were the core function domains of promoter, were found through bioinformatics analysis (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/ plantcare/html/) (S1 Fig). We then examined the tissue-specific activity of the BnLATE promoter from ZS11 by generating the pBnLATE::GUS construct and transforming it into Arabidopsis Col-0 plants.. Ten independent positive pBnLATE::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis lines were obtained and grown under long day (LD) condition, and the GUS activity exhibited tissue-specific expression throughout development. In young transgenic seedlings, GUS activity was clearly visible in the roots, shoots, and leaves. Whereas during flowering, it was mainly confined to the flower (S2 Fig). Significantly, GUS was particularly active in the transgenic silique walls and replum of yellowing siliques (Fig 3A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0168046.g003. Fig 3. .

(C) Representative images of yellowed siliques of controls Col-0, EV and D35S-BnLATE transgenic lines (T5). Bar, 0.50 cm. . . . . . Overexpression of BnLATE in Arabidopsis reduced the lignin content of the silique. Weingartner, Subert [37] reported that no T-DNA insertion lines of AtLATE existed and LATE-RNAi lines did not show any phenotypic variation at any developmental stage, suggesting that the loss-of-function approach is not feasible for examining the in vivo function of AtLATE. However, overexpression of AtLATE in Arabidopsis leads to delayed flowering, inflorescence growth repression, and formation of sterile and incomplete flowers [37]. Given the success of gain-of-function approaches in examining AtLATE, we decided to explore the physiological role of BnLATE by ectopical expressing in Arabidopsis.. We isolated the full-length cDNA of BnLATE, fused it downstream of the double CaMV 35S promoter (D35S) in a vector, and transformed the resulting vector into Arabidopsis wild-type Col-0 plants using the floral dip method [22]. We used the D35S empty vector (EV) as the control. After hygromycin B selection, 22 independent D35S::BnLATE transgenic Arabidopsis lines (L1-L22) were recovered, and 15 out of 22 (68.2%) transgenic lines showed enhanced silique shattering resistance compared with the Col-0 and EV plants, suggesting that overexpression of BnLATE in Arabidopsis could cause variation on dehiscence properties of siliques.. To confirm that this phenotypic variation in the BnLATE transgenic Arabidopsis lines was caused by the ectopic expression of BnLATE, we first examined the expression level of BnLATE in 9-day-old plants of the transgenic lines and the controls Col-0 and EV. Interestingly, the expression of BnLATE in transgenic lines was 0.007 times over that of the internal control ACTIN2 (data not shown), as the levels of BnLATE increased, so did the proportion of siliques exhibiting shattering resistance. Since silique shattering resistance was negatively associated with the degree of lignification in the valves, replum, and valve margin cells [8], Col-0, EV, and three representative BnLATE transgenic lines (L21, L7, and L8), with increasing levels of BnLATE expression in the siliques (Fig 3B) and silique shattering resistance (Table 1 and Fig 3C), were chosen to evaluate the lignin density in the silique wall. We determined the degree of lignification in morphologically identical siliques at 15 DAP in dissected tissues as previously described [25, 26]. Compared with Col-0 and EV, staining color of Safranin/Fast Green was weaker in the replum of siliques of transgenic lines L8 and L7, but not of L21 (Fig 4A and 4B), was well as reduced in the carpels (endocarp b) of transgenic lines L8, L7, and L21 (Fig 4A and 4C). No significant differences were observed in the structure of the valve margin cells, which consist of a layer of lignified cells and a separation layer of small cells, in the replum region, and the valve layer cells.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0168046.g004.

The significant difference compared to Col-0 and EV was determined with Students t-test. p value was shown in the parenthesis, significance was bolded.. . . . Furthermore, we examined the lignin content in the silique walls at 15 DAP of transgenic lines L21, L7 and L8 as well as the controls Col-0 and EV. The total lignin content in the silique wall of three transgenic lines was significantly lower than that of the controls (Fig 4D), while that in the transgenic lines was progressively less in the transgenic lines L21, L7 to L8, which exhibited increasing levels of BnLATE expression (Fig 3B). In other words, the amount of total lignin in silique walls of the controls (Col-0, EV) and transgenic lines (L21, L7, and L8) was inversely associated with the level of BnLATE expression in the siliques of these lines.. Taken together, heterologous expression of BnLATE in the silique wall reduced the degree of lignification in the replum, valve margin, and valve layer cells in Arabidopsis, resulting in enhanced plasticity of yellowing siliques.. . . Endogenous expression variation of BnLATE in B. napus. Since the heterologous expression of BnLATE in Arabidopsis resulted in reduced lignification of the silique walls and enhanced silique shattering resistance, whether had the same expression pattern of BnLATE and lignification changes of the silique wall in rapeseed variety 73290, a B. napus silique shattering-resistant line (shattering resistance index (SRI)> 0.7, as an indicator of silique shattering resistance),due to much lower BnLATE expression in inflorescence of 73290 revealed by microarray analysis [34].. To test this hypothesis, we examined BnLATE expression in the silique walls of 73290 at 12, 24, 36, and 48 DAP using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. BnLATE was remarkably detectable at 48 DAP, but was very weak at the three earlier points (Fig 5A). The expression diagram was semblable with the pattern of pBnLATE::GUS activity in Arabidopsis (Fig 3A). In addition, siliques at the above four developmental stages were harvested and fixed with FAA buffer, dissection and staining with Safranin/Fast Green buffer was performed as previous description [25, 26], lignin in the silique walls stained red. The intensity of staining gradually increased in the replum, valve margin, and valve layer of 73290 from 12 to 36 DAP, but the intensity of staining at 48 DAP was a little lower than at 36 DAP (Fig 5B). These results were further proved to be reliable at the lignin content measured in the silique walls of 73290 at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 DAP (Fig 5C). Furthermore, the silique shattering resistance index (SRI) was measured in mature siliques of 73290 using a previously described random impact test [28]. As shown in Fig 5D, the SRI of 73290 was as high as 0.78 and 0.75 at 252 and 280 revolutions per minute (rpm), respectively, and under the extreme rpm (313) still with 0.35. These results indicate that BnLATE activity was important for proper lignification in the replum, valve margin, and valve layer of the yellowing silique wall, and thus affects the silique shattering resistance index of the mature silique in B. napus.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0168046.g005.

Transcriptomic analysis of BnLATE-regulated pathways. To investigate the genome-wide effects of BnLATE overexpression on transcription, we performed transcriptome sequencing 15-DAP siliques of the D35S::BnLATE transgenic line L8 and control Col-0 plants. A total of 33854 genes were expressed both in L8 and Col-0. Using a combined criterion of 2-fold or greater change and a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05, 385 and 291 genes were up- and down-regulated in transgenic line L8 vs. Col-0, respectively (S1 Table). These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the BnLATE overexpression line L8 with respect to their roles were grouped based on TAIR10. A total of 21 categories harboring at least three or more genes were classified and 14 categories were highly enriched with strong confidence levels (p<0.05), including categories such as cell wall development, secondary metabolism, and hormone metabolism (Fig 6A). Interestingly, 119 of the 676 DEGs encoding enzymes were assigned into 23 pathways harboring at least three or more DEGs according to KEGG analysis (Fig 6B and S2 Table). About 53.8% (64 out of 119) of the DEGs were down-regulated in L8 and that these genes were mainly involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolic pathways (Fig 6C). The remaining 46.2% of DEGs were up-regulated in L8 and were mainly demanded for flavonoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction (Fig 6D).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0168046.g006. Fig 6. .

(D) Up-regulated DEGs encoding enzymes in a D35S::BnLATE transgenic Arabidopsis line L8. Red dashed box indicates the preferred pathways.. . . . . . Expression of genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. Most of the structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway were detected by RNA-seq both in the transgenic line L8 and control Col-0. Among those DEGs involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, 19 encoding peroxidase (EC-1.11.1.7), two encoding UDP-glucosyl transferase (EC-2.4.1.111), and two encoding beta-glucosidase (EC-3.2.1.21) were down-regulated in the L8 transgenic line (Table 2). The 19 down-regulated DEGs encoding peroxidase (EC-1.11.1.7), were related to the final step of lignin biosynthesis, in which 4-hydroxy cinnamyl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols are respectively coupled to polymerizing p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) units [38], resulting in lignin polymers (Fig 7C). Four (AT1G05250, AT3G21770, AT5G64120 and AT5G66390) of the 19 down-regulated DEGs encoding cationic cell wall-bound peroxidase homologs (PRX2, PRXR9, PRX71 and PRX72), had been verified to oxidize monolignols efficiently and lignin oligomers directly, which was highly consistent with previous analyses of the syringyl unit and lignin contents in prx2, prx71, and prx72 mutants with Arabidopsis Col-0 background [15, 38-41] (Table 2). In addition, two DEGs (AT3G50740 and AT5G66690) encoding UDP-glucosyl transferases (UGT72E1 and UGT72E2, EC-2.4.1.111) were down-regulated in the transgenic line L8. UGT72E1 and UGT72E2 encode UDPG coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferases that specifically glucosylate sinapyl- and coniferyl-aldehydes, which are thought to be involved in lignin metabolism. Previous studies [42, 43] reported that the level of coniferyl alcohol 4-O-glucoside and sinapyl alcohol 4-O-glucoside in the UGT72E2-RNAi knockdown line was two-fold lower than in the wild type. Using real-time PCR, we validated the expression pattern of the above-mentioned genes in the siliques at 15 DAP of the transgenic Arabidopsis lines L8, L21 and the control Col-0, which were highly consistent with that of RNA-seq analysis (Fig 7A and Table 2), suggesting that BnLATE overexpression strongly diminished lignin biosynthesis in the silique wall by lowering the expression level of genes encoding peroxidases.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0168046.g007.

Moreover, DEGs encoding F3H/TT7 (AT5G07990), DFR/TT3 (AT5G42800), ANS/LDOX (AT4G22880), and BAN (AT1G61720), involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway of Arabidopsis, were up-regulated in transgenic line L8 (Fig 7B and Table 2). As anthocyanins, flavonols and proanthocyanidins are synthesized through the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway [44-48], one would expect the amount of anthocyanins, flavonols, and proanthocyanidins to be reasonably increased in L8. We therefore quantitated the anthocyanin content and found that the siliques of transgenic line L8 had higher anthocyanin than did those of Col-0 (S3 Fig), indicating that flavonoid biosynthesis has been enhanced when BnLATE overexpressed in Arabidopsis.. . . Phenotyping of pBnLATE::BnLATE transgenic lines. In order to further confirm the effect of BnLATE on lignin biosynthesis in yellow silique wall, an expression vector of BnLATE driven by its own promoter was constructed. Following transformation, selection with hygromycin B and confirmation with PCR, 11 independent homogenous transgenic lines were reserved. For ease of operation, we chose one from the 11 transgenic lines and assigned as pBnLATE::BnLATE-1 (T3) for further investigation (Fig 8A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0168046.g008. Fig 8. .

Asterisks above the columns indicate the significant difference compared with Col-0 and EV. * p< 0.05, ** P< 0.01.. . . . The expression pattern of BnLATE in siliques of pBnLATE::BnLATE-1 and Col-0 was canvased using qRT-PCR at 5 DAP (I), 10 DAP (II), 20 DAP (III), and 30 DAP (IV) (Fig 8B). Expression level of BnLATE in pBnLATE::BnLATE-1 line at stages III and IV were apparently higher than that at stages I and II (Fig 8C), and these observations further demonstrated the reliability of the pBnLATE activity detected in pBnLATE::GUS transgenic lines (Fig 3A). Moreover, expression pattern of four peroxidase genes (PRX2, PRX35, PRX71, and PRX72) in the siliques of pBnLATE::BnLATE-1 line and Col-0 at stages I, II, III, and IV were identified with qRT-PCR as well. Compared with Col-0, all four genes were selectively down-regulated at stages III or/and IV in pBnLATE::BnLATE-1 line (Fig 8F) as well as in D35S::BnLATE transgenic lines revealed by RNA-seq (Fig 7A and Table 2). Consequently, microscopic observation was performed on replum and carpel of pBnLATE::BnLATE-1 and Col-0 stained by safranin/fast green at stages I, II, III, and IV. In contrast to Col-0, no obvious staining color (red) was observed in the carpel of pBnLATE::BnLATE-1 at stages III and IV, and lignification cells in the dehiscence zone was apparently lessened as well (Fig 9). Meanwhile, mature siliques of pBnLATE::BnLATE-1 line exhibited enhanced silique shattering resistance vs. Col-0 (Fig 8D and 8E). These observations further demonstrated that higher expressing BnLATE could strongly decrease lignin biosynthesis in yellowing silique walls through depressing genes encoding peroxidases, resulting in enhanced silique shattering resistance.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0168046.g009.

PMC4346619	Results. . VOCs released by Laccaria promote LR growth. Poplar or Arabidopsis plants were grown in the presence of fungal VOCs by cultivating plants and L. bicolor mycelia in bi-compartmented Petri dishes (Fig. 1a-d), hereafter referred to as headspace co-cultivation. Despite the absence of direct contact with L. bicolor, strong stimulation of LR development was observed in both plant species, which must have been caused by volatile compounds (Fig. 1a-d). The stimulation of LR formation started after 4d.h.c.c. (days of headspace co-cultivation) and resulted in almost twice the number of LR tips after 10d.h.c.c. with L. bicolor (Fig. 1b,d). In closed growth systems, fluctuations in CO2 availability due to plant CO2 consumption and release by fungal respiration can influence LR formation14. We excluded the possibility that LR stimulation under headspace co-cultivation conditions was solely an effect of altered CO2 levels caused by the presence of the mycelium (Supplementary Fig. 1a-c). Therefore, besides CO2, other VOCs (OVOCs) must be involved in LR induction. C. geophilum, a mycorrhizal fungus known to emit only few different VOCs13, did not induce LR development (Fig. 1d). Because C. geophilum specifically lacks SQTs, a class of compounds previously shown to be biologically active1015 and to diffuse well in the soil environment16, we suspected that this VOC class could be involved in LR formation.. L. bicolor VOCs promoted the growth of Arabidopsis primary and LRs (sum of the lengths of all LRs17) by 21 and 158% in comparison with control roots and control LRs, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). To exclude that LR formation was only a function of the length of the main root, we calculated the LR density (number of LRs per root length). LR density increased by 27% in the presence of L. bicolor VOCs (Supplementary Fig. 2c). This result suggested that the fungus may also have promoted the initiation of LR primordia (LRP) (Supplementary Fig. 2c). To test this hypothesis, we quantified the number of LRs initiated along the portion of the root developed after 3 days and 7 days of headspace co-cultivation using DR5::GFP reporter fusion, a well-established marker of LRP18 (Supplementary Fig. 2d-g). L. bicolor VOC-treated plants displayed a higher density of LR per cm (0.5 after 3 days and 0.8 after 7 days) compared with non-treated plants (0.05 after 3 days and 0.1 after 7days) (Supplementary Fig. 2d). All together, these data demonstrate that L. bicolor VOCs promoted the initiation of LRP and their further elongation.. . . Laccaria VOCs induce superoxide anion radicals in roots. In addition to LR development, L. bicolor VOCs also promoted root hair growth (Fig. 2a). The root hairs of L. bicolor VOC-treated plants were on average 71313mum long versus only 51314mum for controls (means.e., n=100-121, P=6.8  10-18 Students t-test). Overall, we observed a 39% increase in the root hair length under fungal VOC exposure (Fig. 2b). Because the polar tip growth of pollen tubes and root hairs is associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation19, we tested whether the L. bicolor VOC-mediated stimulation of root hair growth was ROS dependent. In the presence of 100nM diphenyleneiodium (DPI) (an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, an enzyme involved in O2-. production20), the root hair length was similarly reduced in mock-treated and plants incubated with L. bicolor VOCs (Fig. 2b,c). The root hair length was reduced by 32% in control plants, and the presence of the fungus did not overcome this inhibition, suggesting that L. bicolor VOCs promote root hair growth through a ROS-dependent mechanism. A role of O2-. in L. bicolor VOC-promoted root hair and LR formation was further tested in Arabidopsis ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE (RHD2)-mutants. The RHD2 gene encodes an NADPH oxidase that transfers electrons from NADPH to an electron acceptor, leading to the formation of ROS19. Because O2-.radicals are necessary for root hair growth, rhd2 plants develop very short root hairs19. When grown with L. bicolor in the same headspace co-cultivation system, rhd2 mutants were unresponsive to both root hair growth and LR stimulation by L. bicolor VOCs (Fig. 2d-f). These data suggest that RHD2-dependent O2-.production contributes to LR and root hair growth stimulation by L. bicolor. We then questioned whether L. bicolor VOCs could induce ROS accumulation in Arabidopsis roots. Superoxide anion radicals were detected by staining roots with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). Indeed, compared with control plants, 70% (n=15) of roots exposed to L. bicolor VOCs displayed stronger O2- staining in the root tip than the control plants (Fig. 2g).. . . Laccaria VOCs do not alter auxin signalling in roots. The phytohormone auxin controls several aspects of plant development, including LR development21. In earlier studies, an increase in the auxin response was visualized with the auxin-sensitive DR5::GFP reporter fusion in Arabidopsis root tips growing in contact with L. bicolor2. Here, we tested whether the influence of L. bicolor VOCs on root development also involved changes in auxin signalling in the root. Five-day-old Arabidopsis DR5::GFP plants were grown in headspace co-cultivation with L. bicolor, and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal was monitored after 3 and 5d.h.c.c. We did neither observe a change in the auxin signal in any of the root tips nor along the root system, where LRs emerge, for plants cultivated in the presence of L. bicolor VOCs (Supplementary Fig. 2d-h). This observation suggests that the activity of VOCs on LR and root hair development does not involve changes in auxin signalling pathways.. . . Identification of VOC patterns in plant-fungal co-cultures. To identify the VOCs responsible for LR induction, VOC patterns of L. bicolor, C. geophilum, Arabidopsis and plant-fungus combinations were measured in the headspace, and the released compounds were classified as monoterpenes (MTs), SQTs or OVOCs (Table 1; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Compared with other fungal species, L. bicolor and C. geophilum are weak VOC emitters with distinct differences in their emission patterns15. The most obvious was the difference in SQT abundance. The VOC profile of L. bicolor contained predominantly SQTs, whereas these were not observed in the presence of C. geophilum (Table 1).. Arabidopsis without fungal mycelium did not release any SQTs. The headspace co-culture of Arabidopsis and L. bicolor resulted in VOC patterns that differed slightly from those of the separately grown organisms. We observed a new SQT, valencene, in the co-culture, whereas two VOCs found in separate cultures of Arabidopsis or L. bicolor, were absent. Eleven SQTs that were identified in the headspace of separately grown L. bicolor were also present in the co-culture (Table 1). In the headspace co-cultures of C. geophilum and Arabidopsis no SQT and only one MT was observed.. . . Sesquiterpenes are the main signal for the stimulation of LR. The presence of SQTs in the VOC profile of L. bicolor is likely to be important for LR stimulation, as their absence in C. geophilum correlates with the absence of LR induction. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited SQT biosynthesis in L. bicolor and studied the effect on LR stimulation in Arabidopsis. Lovastatin is a competitive inhibitor of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway required for cytosolic isoprenoid and hence SQT biosynthesis22. Growth of L. bicolor on lovastatin-supplemented medium suppressed SQT biosynthesis (Table 1) but did not impair fungal growth. In the headspace co-cultivation system, we added lovastatin only in the fungal compartment to prevent any direct effects of the inhibitor on the plant. Thereby, the overall SQT abundance released by the fungus into the headspace of 10-day-old co-cultures was significantly reduced from 14.83.4 to 6.12.2pmolcm-2 SQTs per mycelium surface area (means.e., n=10 plates per treatment, P=0.024, Students t-test). The suppressed SQT biosynthesis resulted in the disappearance of five SQTs: beta-caryophyllene, (-)-thujopsene, gamma-cadinene, isoledene and cadina-1,4-diene (Table 1). In contrast to the SQTs, the amounts of MTs and OVOCs were not significantly affected by lovastatin treatment (Table 1).. Arabidopsis and poplar plants developing their root system under the altered VOC profile, in which distinct fungal SQTs were suppressed by lovastatin (Table 1), did not show stimulation of LR formation (Fig. 3a,c; Supplementary Fig. 3a). These results strongly support a role of SQTs in VOC-induced LR formation.. Because the two SQTs (-)-thujopsene and beta-caryophyllene were most strongly suppressed by lovastatin treatment, we investigated their involvement in LR formation. Both SQTs were tested independently at increasing concentrations during headspace co-cultivation for their ability to induce LR (Supplementary Fig. 3b-f). beta-Caryophyllene had no effect on LR formation, neither in Arabidopsis nor in poplar (Supplementary Fig. 3d,f). (-)-Thujopsene, employed at a concentration corresponding to 6.4pmol after 6h of headspace collection, stimulated LR formation in Arabidopsis by ~30% (Fig. 3b). The influence of (-)-thujopsene on poplar was even stronger than on Arabidopsis, where approximately twice as many LRs were observed in the presence than in the absence of this SQT (Fig. 3d). When fungal SQT biosynthesis was blocked by lovastatin, the addition of (-)-thujopsene to the headspace fully rescued LR stimulation in both Arabidopsis and poplar (Fig. 3a,c)..
PMC2803208	ResultsFFT encodes a MATE proteinThe 488 amino acid protein (AtDTX35; estimated mol. wt, 53.2kDa) is classified as a MATE protein (see TAIR; www.arabidopsis.org/abrc/). The most similar proteins to FFT in BLAST searches are an anthocyanin permease in tomato (Mathews et al., 2003; 72% identity at the protein level), an unknown protein in grape (70% identity), a putative ripening-regulated protein in rice (DDTFR18, Os08g0562800; 61% identity), and four other Arabidopsis MATE proteins (48-67% identity; Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). As expected, hydropathy plots (TMPred; www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/) predict 12 transmembrane spans for the protein encoded by At4g25640. There is no recognizable signal peptide to predict targeting of the translated protein (SignalP, PredoTar; urgi.versailles.inra.fr/predotar/predotar.html). Glutamate residues may be important for activity in MATE proteins, and one such, found in almost every eukaryotic and prokaryotic MATE protein's seventh transmembrane domain, is also seen in FFT (Supplementary Fig. S1). Site-directed mutagenesis of this amino acid in the human MATE1 protein severely affected expression and prevented uptake of tetraethylammonium substrate in human embryonic kidney-293 cells (Matsumoto et al., 2008). Consistent with a likely role in flavonoid metabolism, a search for cis regulatory elements (PLACE database; Higo et al., 1999) finds MYB recognition sequences upstream of At4g25640 including two MYB-binding sites commonly found in flavonoid pathway genes such as CHS (consensus MACCWAMC; Sablowski et al., 1994), situated at -99nt and -23nt relative to the start codon.FFT is most strongly expressed in floral tissues and guard cellsRT-PCR indicates that FFT is highly transcribed in floral organs and is present to some degree in most tissues, including young seedlings, senescent leaves and roots (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). To investigate further the spatial and temporal expression of FFT, a 1.4kb genomic fragment from immediately upstream of the coding regions was amplified and fused to the uidA reporter gene. Floral tissues of plants transformed with this construct again showed the strongest activity (Fig. 2). Notably, GUS expression directed by the FFT promoter was almost exclusively found in guard cells in aerial tissues, including the specialized guard cells of nectaries and the hydathodes of leaves. Anther, stigma and silique guard cells were strongly stained, whereas the activity in mature leaf guard cells was reduced compared with those of the inflorescence and of the cotyledon (Fig. 2b). In newly germinated seedlings, as well as strong staining in leaf guard cells, there was GUS activity in the roots (Fig. 2a). By day 4 post-stratification (ps), on 1/2MS plates (t=0 at transfer of plants to growth chamber), staining was found in two discrete areas of the roots, namely at the root apex (meristematic zone) and in the elongation zone through to the fully expanded cells of the differentiation zone. The transition zone showed little staining. GUS activity in the elongation-differentiation zone was strongest internal to the epidermis, apparently in the endodermis and cortex. The tips of lateral roots were also stained blue (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2.X-gluc staining of GUS-FFT-promoter-transformed plants (each row, left-right).

(b) Aerial tissues: (row 1) cotyledon guard cells (GC); mature leaf hydathode GC; nectaries; (row 2) inflorescence apex; silique apex; close-up of papillae and stigma GC; (row 3) anther GC; developing seed in siliques; developing silique.Isolation of the fft-1 null mutantSeeds of two mutants with T-DNA insertions in the At4g25640 open reading frame (ORF) were obtained from the NASC. Both were segregated to homozygosity. The insertion in line N552331 was situated 200bp into the 3-untranslated region: this mutant (fft-2) was not null so was not studied further. Transcript was abolished in line N604224 (fft-1), in which the T-DNA was inserted into the third intron (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). Having established that only one T-DNA was present in this line (Supplementary Fig. S3), phenotypic analyses were conducted on the homozygous mutant fft-1.Several differences were observed between fft-1 and WT (Col0) plants in terms of growth and fertility. To ensure these phenotypic effects were the consequence of loss of function of FFT, genetic rescue was carried out, re-introducing a WT cDNA into the mutant line. The ectopic copy of the WT gene restored normal growth and fertility: root growth, seed and pollen development phenotypes were tested, and it was found that the FFT cDNA complemented all aspects of the mutation (Fig. 3-5; Supplementary Figs S4, S5 at JXB online).Fig. 3.(a) Germination of the fft-1 (- -) mutant versus Col0 (-).

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)Fig. 5.(a) Alexander's staining showing (left-right) lack of dehiscence, no pollen on the stigma, and reduced proportion of viable pollen in anthers in fft-1 (second row) versus Col0 (top row). Top right: pollen production and dehiscence in complemented fft-1. (b) Variable success of silique production in fft-1 versus Col0 and complemented fft-1.Germination and seed morphology is perturbed in fft-1Of plate-grown plants, >30% of the fft-1 mutant seeds [standard error of the mean (SE), 6%] had germinated by 29h ps whereas in the WT this was <14% (SE, 4%; t-test P = 0.01, 14 df; Fig. 3a]. Fewer mutant seeds in total, however, germinated successfully in the mutant by 99h [WT, 100% (SE, 2%); fft-1, 84% (SE, 6%)]. Because flavonoid mutants often show altered seedcoats and, because germination in fft-1 was variable, seeds were examined for physical abnormalities. The seedcoat of fft-1 was brown pigmented like that of the WT, but ruthenium red (RR) staining showed altered seed mucilage. RR stains acidic polysaccharides such as pectic polysaccharides: with imbibing Arabidopsis seeds, RR densely stains an inner layer of mucilage plus an outer, more diffuse (and easily disrupted) layer (Macquet et al., 2007). This staining of imbibing fft-1 seeds showed that the surrounding mucilage layer was absent or disrupted in the mutant. In the WT, 87% (SE, 3%) had complete mucilage compared with only 50% (SE, 4%) in the mutant (t-test, P <0.0001, 44 df; Fig. 3c, d). Seed mucilage contributes to seed dormancy and, thus, heterogeneous mucilage release in fft-1 mutant seeds is consistent with the abnormal germination rates. In addition, seed size was significantly more variable in the mutant (F-test, P <0.005), although mean seed size was not significantly different from that of the WT (Fig. 3b).FFT affects growth ratesIt was noticed that mutant seedlings appeared to grow and mature more quickly than the WT, so assays of root growth were carried out using plants on 1/2MS with and without sucrose (the former to promote anthocyanin production, in case of any effect). The mutant showed significantly faster root growth in all cases (Fig. 4a, b; for no sucrose: t-test, P <0.001 day 8, 64 df). Although the different germination characteristics meant that fewer fft-1 seeds were viable than WT seeds, the difference in mean rate of root growth developed after day 3-4 ps (when all viable seeds had successfully germinated) and continued to develop, suggesting that faster germination was not the primary cause of the root growth phenotype. The growth rate of fft-1 up to 2 weeks was greater under all conditions tested, including cold (4C) and higher intensity light (250mumol m-2 s-1).Fertility of fft-1 is reducedWhen examined using cryo-SEM, a proportion of mutant pollen appeared shrunken and irregular, and/or had an aberrant surface structure (Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online). To examine this further, Alexander's stain was used to differentiate viable from non-viable pollen. Acid fuchsin stains the protoplasm of viable pollen purple, and malachite green (MG) is a background counterstain. This can give an overestimate of viability, since non-viable pollen can contain protoplasm (Pline et al., 2002), but here a distinct difference between WT and fft-1 flowers was shown (Fig. 5a). Series of flowers at identical stages and positions on the primary inflorescence were sampled and stained. In contrast to WT anthers, which were plump, full of purple-stained pollen, and showed many pollen grains released upon dehiscence, the mutant anthers appeared thinner and had a lower proportion of (but did contain some) round, purple pollen grains. Much of the pollen in mutant anthers stained only blue-green, the cell walls coloured only by MG (Fig. 5a).Many fft-1 anthers fail to dehisce, with no visible pollen outside each (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online). This was also obvious in epifluorescence microscopy. DPBA was used to enhance cytoplasmic flavonol fluorescence: it gives high emission levels when bound to flavonols rather than other flavonoids, for example fluorescing at 520nm and 543nm when bound to the flavonols kaempferol and quercitin, respectively (Saslowsky and Winkel-Shirley, 2001). WT flowers treated with DPBA showed bright yellow pollen: in contrast, only a few, non-fluorescent, pollen grains were present on mutant flowers (data not shown).Arabidopsis siliques elongate as seeds develop following successful fertilization: reduced silique length is a visible demonstration of diminished fertility. In the fft-1 mutant plants, silique length is very variable (Fig. 5b) and seed number per silique was lower than in the WT [WT mean, 51 (SE, 11); fft-1 mean, 25 (SE, 5); t-test P=0.0001, 19 df].Flavonoid metabolism is perturbed in mutant plantsIn fft-1 mutant seedlings up to 1 week of age, extracted anthocyanins were slightly reduced in level compared with the WT (not shown), but the pigment was visible even in young tissues and, in quantity, in mature fft-1 and WT plants grown on high (5% w/v) sucrose, which were comparable, dark purple, colours.Following epifluorescent imaging of the WT and fft-1, it was hypothesized that confocal microscopy would reveal differences in flavonoid content of the plants. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was therefore used essentially to perform fluorescence spectroscopy, and thus indicate any changes to flavonoid levels (a technique previously used by Hideg et al., 2002, and discussed in Pfndel et al., 2006). Since GUS staining had occurred strongly in floral guard cells, inflorescence tissues treated with DPBA were excited with UV light (364nm) and an emission spectrum was recorded (400-730nm). Spectra were recorded from anther guard cells in WT or mutant flowers (inset, Fig. 6a) from the same position on an inflorescence (the first open flower below the unopened bud cluster), in which flavonoids should be comparable. A peak of emission from anther guard cells expected to result from flavonoid excitation could be visualized at 500-580nm in WT tissues (Fig. 6b). Notably, a component of the fluorescence spectrum at 520nm was absent in fft-1 (Fig. 6b), coinciding with the expected peak from flavonol-DPBA secondary fluorescence (Saslowsky and Winkel-Shirley, 2001). To quantify and test statistically the difference in replicate flowers, the well-defined flavonoid fluorescence peak at 580nm and the peak from chlorophyll fluorescence were used to produce a ratio of flavonoid:chlorophyll emission. The ratios were significantly different between WT and fft-1, suggesting a lower flavonoid content in the mutant [WT, 1.60 (SE, 0.14) versus fft-1, 0.86 (SE, 0.05); t-test P=0.0016, 28 df; Fig. 6a]. Chlorophyll content was confirmed to be the same in WT and fft-1 mutant plants to make certain that levels of that pigment were not responsible for the differences observed, nor for any other aspect of the mutant phenotype (other photosynthetic parameters were also unaffected; see Supplementary Note S7 at JXB online). The products of the reactions of DPBA with flavonoids have not been comprehensively identified, however, so this can only be an indication of a difference in the flavonoid content in fft-1.Fig. 6.(a) Col0 versus fft-1 mean ratio of flavonoid (580nm) and chlorophyll fluorescence (690nm; Bolhar-Nordenkampf et al., 1989).

(b) Examples of replicate fluorescence emission spectra from guard cells in Col0 and fft-1 anthers (background subtracted; normalized to 690nm). (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)To investigate specific changes in flavonoid composition resulting from loss of the FFT-encoded protein, LC-MS was carried out on fft-1 mutant versus WT plants. A wide range of tissues was initially tested, guided by the position of GUS staining, to identify any differences between WT and fft-1 samples at the same stages of development. More plants were then grown so that the tissues where fft-1 apparently had different levels of particular metabolites could be sampled and analysed in replicate assays. Consistent differences were noted in plants from the separate sowings: in particular, mutant buds and siliques contained an altered spectrum of flavonol glycosides, with several peaks present at 40-70% the level in the WT, namely quercitin-rhamnoside-glucoside, kaempferol-glucoside-glucoside (kGG), and kaempferol-rhamnoside-glucoside. In contrast, there were almost doubled levels of quercitin-rhamnoside-glucoside-rhamnoside in buds (Table 1), and high levels of this flavonol were consistently found in mutant seedlings, suggesting that flavonoid synthesis and/or transport is perturbed in the fft-1 mutant. The difference in the levels of kGG was significant (t-test P=0.018, 5 df; see also Supplementary Fig. S8 at JXB online).Table 1.Relative level of flavonol glycosides in mutant versus wild-type (WT) floral tissues (further data in Supplementary Fig. S8 at JXB online)Peak and tissue typeMean content in fft-1 versus WT (%)kGG bud*40kRG bud70kRG immature silique73qRGR bud180qRG bud65qRG immature silique49*P=0.018, 5 df.q, quercitin; R, rhamnoside; G, glucoside; IS, immature silique; k, kaempferol..
PMC4507761	Results. . Global expression profiling of core cell-cycle genes identifies CYCD3 D-type cyclins as potential regulators of vascular development. To explore the wider role of the cell cycle in vascular development and to identify candidate cell-cycle genes that promote cambial cell proliferation, the transcriptional regulation of all known core cell-cycle genes was examined using data from high resolution Arabidopsis cell- and tissue-specific microarray profiles derived from the root tip (Brady et al., 2007) and mature hypocotyl (Zhao et al., 2005). The combination of both datasets essentially provides broad coverage of cambium-associated expression during both primary and secondary vascular development. In Arabidopsis, 110 core cell-cycle genes have been recognized (Vandepoele et al., 2002; Menges et al., 2005; Van Leene et al., 2010) and, of these, 96 are represented by ATH1 array probes. Their transcription profiles weree first examined across 19 different cell and tissue types of the root tip (Brady et al., 2007), and included data on four classical markers of cambial activity (MP/ARF5, WOL, ATHB8, and PIN1; Hardtke and Berleth, 1998; Mhnen et al., 2000; Scarpella et al., 2004, 2006) in order to correlate cell-cycle gene transcriptional activity with vascular stem cell division. This showed different core cell-cycle regulators to have distinct expression patterns in the root, with the majority of genes showing low overall expression variation across all cell and tissue types and thus low cell- and tissue-specificity (see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). As expected, the four cambium markers showed enrichment in cells and tissues derived from the vasculature confirming that the root expression map (Brady et al., 2007) can serve as a reliable approximation of a vascular tissue-specific profile.. Cluster analysis of core cell-cycle and cambium marker gene expression profiles showed that genes exhibiting a relatively constant, low expression level across the root tip generally cluster together (comprising the major proportion of genes) and revealed several separate clusters comprising co-regulated genes sharing vascular tissue-associated activity (Fig. 1A). Outside the main cluster of genes with constant low expression, two clusters of regulated genes can be broadly defined; the first cluster contains genes clearly enriched in the vasculature, quiescent centre (QC), and lateral root primordia (LRP), and including ATHB8, MP, and PIN1, and a second cluster containing genes generally enriched in the vasculature but showing more variable expression peaks in other cell layers and including WOL (Fig. 1A). The second cluster also contained a small subset of genes which exhibited a more constant high level of expression across all cell layers, exemplified by CDKA;1 and CDKG;1 (Fig. 1A). Having a broadly shared pattern of specificity for the vasculature, cluster 1 and cluster 2 were designated, with the exception of CYCD2;1, DPa, RBR, E2Fc, and CDKD;2, as vasculature-associated comprising 28 cell-cycle genes and four cambium marker genes. All 96 core cell-cycle genes and four cambium marker genes were ranked according to their average expression levels across all seven cell and tissue types representing the vasculature (Fig. 1B). The most highly vasculature-enriched genes included all four cambium markers, accompanied by representative gene members from almost all the main core cell cycle gene families (Vandepoele et al., 2002; Menges et al., 2005; Van Leene et al., 2010). Importantly, the vast majority of genes identified as vasculature-associated (Fig. 1A), also had high overall expression in the vasculature (Fig. 1B), suggesting cell-cycle genes in this cluster have distinct roles in primary vascular development.. .

The expression levels shown are relative to zero based on global normalization method (Brady et al., 2007). Two distinct clusters of co-regulated genes showing broadly vasculature-associated expression are indicated (cluster 1 and cluster 2).

Only the top 25 highest PC-enriched genes are shown.. . . . The expression patterns of core cell-cycle genes were examined next using data from transcriptional profiling of the mature hypocotyl (Zhao et al., 2005). Calculations of fold-differences between mean array signal intensities in phloem/cambium (PC) versus xylem (X) tissue (PC/X), and in PC versus non-vascular (NV) tissues (PC/NV) (Zhao et al., 2005), revealed a group of 25 cell-cycle genes showing high specificity for phloem/cambium tissue suggesting distinct roles in secondary vascular development (Fig. 1C). A significant overlap was noted between the set of 25 PC-specific cell-cycle genes in the mature hypocotyl (Fig. 1C), and the set of 28 cell-cycle genes identified as vasculature-associated in the root tip (Fig. 1A). Indeed, 11 cell-cycle genes were shared between both sets. This suggests that a common set of core cell-cycle genes are involved in both primary and secondary vascular development.. As we were primarily interested in identifying core cell-cycle genes that are involved in promoting cambial cell divisions, the root and hypocotyl microarray profiles (Fig. 1) were scrutinized for positive cell-cycle regulators having a clear vascular tissue-associated profile. Close inspection of the data shows that the CYCD3 class of D-type cyclins appear prominently among vasculature-enriched genes expressed during both primary and secondary vascular development (Fig. 1A-C; see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). The CYCD3 subgroup has already been shown to be an important positive cell-cycle regulator of cell division in developing leaves and embryos (Dewitte et al., 2007; Collins et al., 2012). Consistent with a proposed role for CYCD3 in vascular development, a partial expression analysis of CYCD3;1 using in situ hybridization revealed activity in the procambium of developing leaves and inflorescence stems (Dewitte et al., 2003). Strikingly, it was found that the CYCD3 genes also show peaks of activity in the QC and LRP, a pattern shared with known cambium regulators such as PIN1 and MP (Fig. 1A; Hardtke and Berleth, 1998; Scarpella et al., 2004, 2006), providing further confirmation of a close association between CYCD3 expression and vascular stem cell-associated activity. In light of these results, the decision was taken to focus our molecular investigations to elucidate the role of CYCD3 in vascular development.. . . . CYCD3 genes are expressed in the cambium throughout development. To investigate a functional role for CYCD3 in vascular development, an attempt was made to determine more precisely the in planta expression of CYCD3 genes using available GUS reporter transgenic plants. CYCD3;1 has already been shown to be expressed in the procambium of developing leaves and inflorescence stems (Dewitte et al., 2003). A preliminary expression analysis showed CYCD3;2 and CYCD3;3 to be expressed in seedling vascular tissue (Collins, 2008). However, this study did not achieve the spatial resolution required to determine whether these genes are specifically active in vascular stem cells, as found for CYCD3;1 (Dewitte et al., 2003). Therefore, we focused on determining the detailed tissue- and cell-specific expression of CYCD3;2 and CYCD3;3 during vascular tissue formation at different plant developmental stages using the GUS reporter lines pCYCD3;2:GUS and pCYCD3;3:GUS, respectively (Dewitte et al., 2007). Both genes shared a remarkable degree of overlap in their expression domains with activity closely associated with vascular tissue initiation from seedling to adult plant stages (Fig. 2). In 7-d-old seedlings, pCYCD3;2:GUS and pCYCD3;3:GUS showed strong activity in developing vasculature of cotyledons, leaves, hypocotyls, and roots (Fig. 2A-H). In roots, pCYCD3;2:GUS and pCYCD3;3:GUS expression marked the two procambial cell files, beginning first in the root apical meristem (RAM) with persistent activity in the elongation and maturation zones (Fig. 2E, F), and throughout the mature root zones and in emerging lateral roots (Fig. 2G, H). Examination of transverse sections from 5mm below the shoot apex of adult stems, corresponding to the zone where vascular development is initiated, showed pCYCD3;2:GUS and pCYCD3;3:GUS expression specifically in mitotically active procambial cells (Fig. 2I, J). In intact whole 30-cm-long stems, an accumulation of pCYCD3;2:GUS and pCYCD3;3:GUS staining was observed in a narrow region at the stem base immediately above the rosette leaves (Fig. 2K, L), corresponding to the zone of maximum interfascicular cambium (IC) initiation and secondary growth identified previously (Sehr et al., 2010). Transverse sections across this zone in both reporter lines confirmed GUS activity specifically in the fascicular cambium (FC) and IC (Fig. 2M, N).. . Fig. 2.. . .

In (E) and (F), the root apical meristem is indicated by arrowheads.

Scale bars=250 mum (A, B), 100 mum (C, D, G, H, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T), 50 mum (E, F), 25 mum (I, J).. . . . Examination of the stem base from a GUS reporter line representing the CYCD3;1 gene, pCYCD3;1:GUS (Riou-Khamlichi et al., 1999), failed to show any staining (data not shown). However, consistent with previous expression studies of CYCD3;1 in the stem (Dewitte et al., 2003), CYCD3;1 transcripts were detected at the base (and top and middle) of mature stems using RT-PCR (Fig. 2O), suggesting that the pCYCD3;1:GUS line may not entirely recapitulate the true expression pattern for CYCD3;1 in the stem. Nevertheless, pCYCD3;1:GUS activity was observed in the root vasculature, which became progressively stronger as the roots reached mature stages, coinciding with the onset of root secondary growth (Fig. 2P, Q). Transverse sections of mature hypocotyls from 30-cm-tall plants revealed pCYCD3;1:GUS, pCYCD3;2:GUS, and pCYCD3;3:GUS expression specifically in the mitotically active cells of the vascular cambium, coinciding with the major phase of secondary growth in the hypocotyl (Fig. 2R-T). The expression patterns determined for all three CYCD3s using GUS reporters were in strong agreement with the results obtained from microarray profiling of the root tip and mature hypocotyl (Fig. 1). Together, the overlapping spatiotemporal patterns of CYCD3 transcriptional regulation observed confirm a close association of CYCD3 expression with active procambial/cambial cell proliferation throughout development, consistent with a distinct, subgroup-specific role for CYCD3 in vascular tissue formation.. . . Loss of CYCD3 causes reduced secondary growth and organ size. The highly overlapping patterns of expression observed for the three CYCD3 genes during vascular development suggested that the CYCD3-directed CYCD/RBR/E2F pathway (Dewitte et al., 2003; 2007) might play a specific role in regulating cambial cell proliferation. Therefore, the effect of reduced expression of CYCD3 on secondary growth was examined using a triple homozygous cycd3;1 cycd3;2 cycd3;3 (cycd3;1-3) loss-of-function mutant (Dewitte et al., 2007). Clear developmental defects were seen in cycd3;1-3 plants. At the base of adult stems and mature hypocotyls from 30-cm-tall plants, corresponding to major zones of prominent secondary growth, cycd3;1-3 was thinner compared with their wild-type equivalents (Fig. 3A-D). Radial growth at the stem base was monitored by measuring the diameter at different stages of stem elongation in wild-type and mutant plants. The cycd3;1-3 mutant showed a substantially reduced radial growth rate with an approximately 20% reduction (t test P <0.001) in thickening growth compared with the wild type at the stage where wild-type inflorescences had reached 30cm in length (Fig. 3E). At the base of mature hypocotyls, mutants showed an approximately 25% reduction (t test P <0.001) in thickening growth (Fig. 3F). The reduced stem and hypocotyl phenotypes in cycd3;1-3 closely resemble those reported in plants with mutations in known cambium regulators such as WOX4 and PXY/TDR (Fisher and Turner, 2007; Hirakawa et al., 2008, 2010; Ji et al., 2010), and can be considered diagnostic of plants with reduced cambium activity.. .

(G) Quantitative analysis of stem length in wild-type and cycd3;1-3 plants at 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 63 d (days relative to date of sowing) showing equivalent rates of stem elongation in wild type and cycd3;1-3. Students t test showed that wild type and cycd3;1-3 were not significantly different in stem length at 63 d (n=10). Error bars represent standard error.. . . . Measurements of apical growth of the stem showed that, despite the emergence of the inflorescence being delayed in cycd3;1-3 (see Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online), as previously reported (Dewitte et al., 2007), the rate of stem elongation was comparable between wild type and mutant, with cycd3;1-3 stems reaching the length of their wild-type equivalents toward the end of the growth period (Fig. 3G). These results show clearly that radial growth was more compromised than apical growth, suggesting that a decrease in the activity of the cambium was the major cause of the reduced thickening growth in the stem. Interestingly, delayed emergence and other perturbations in apical growth of the stem are characteristic features of wox4 and pxy mutants (Fisher and Turner, 2007; Ji et al., 2010). In summary, our data indicate an effect of loss of CYCD3 expression on cambium activity, leading to retarded development in the stem and hypocotyl, and reduced organ size.. . . CYCD3 promotes cambial cell proliferation in the inflorescence stem. To determine more precisely the effect of reduced CYCD3 activity on cambium-related cell division and differentiation processes, the vascular anatomy of the stem base of 30-cm-tall cycd3;1-3 plants was analysed. At the base of adult stems, the vascular tissue is composed of radially oriented, closed cylinders of cambium (FC and IC) with an inner xylem and outer phloem which are, in turn, enclosed by a ground tissue (cortex and endodermis) and epidermis layers (Sehr et al., 2010; Sanchez et al., 2012). Different tissue layers are easily distinguished by the characteristic shapes and spatial division planes of the cells comprising each tissue. In terms of overall tissue patterning, the cycd3;1-3 mutant was indistinguishable from the wild type with a normal arrangement of vascular and non-vascular tissue (Fig. 4A, B), and there was no significant difference in the average number of vascular bundles between wild-type and mutant stems (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, calculations of the width:length (tangential:radial) ratio of vascular bundles, a measure of vascular organization (Fisher and Turner, 2007), showed no significant difference between the wild type and cycd3;1-3 (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that tissue patterning is not greatly affected upon loss of cycd3;1-3.. . Fig. 4.. .

Scale bars=200 mum (A, B), 100 mum (E, F).. . . . The FC and its immediate population of daughter cells have been defined as FC-derived (FCD) tissue, whereas the IC and its immediate population of daughter cells were defined as IC-derived (ICD) tissue and both can be used as a measure of cambium activity (Sehr et al., 2010). The effect of loss of CYCD3 function on cambium activity in mature cycd3;1-3 stems was analysed. Microscopic analysis of FCD and ICD in wild-type stems identified the small, uniform, flattened, and undifferentiated cells of the FC and IC organized into radial cell files (resulting from continuous periclinal cell divisions), surrounded by more rounded and less uniformly shaped, differentiating xylem, and phloem and associated parenchyma cells (not organized into radial cell files) (Fig. 4E). Observations in the cycd3;1-3 mutant showed that the equivalent cell types were present and were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type (Fig. 4E, F), indicating that CYCD3 is not essential for the establishment and identity of the cambium. By contrast, quantification of the lateral extension of the cambium-derived tissue in the stem base showed cycd3;1-3 to have an approximately 21% reduction (t test P <0.001) in FCD, and an approximately 48% reduction (t test P <0.001) in ICD, compared with the wild type (Fig. 4G, H), indicating that loss of CYCD3 causes a substantial decrease in the activity of the cambium.. The reduced cambium activity observed in cycd3;1-3 suggested that both cambial cell number and the number of daughter cells in the xylem and phloem lineages could be affected. Quantification of cell numbers in the cambium, xylem, and phloem of cycd3;1-3 and wild-type stems (see Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online; Fig. 4E, F) showed that the number of cells comprising the cambium in cycd3;1-3 was reduced by approximately 52% (t test P <0.01) compared with the wild type, with the mutant also showing respective reductions in xylem and phloem cell number of approximately 31% (t test P <0.05) and 33% (t test P <0.01) (Fig. 4I), confirming that loss of CYCD3 causes a marked decrease in cambium activity, limiting cell number in the xylem and phloem cell lineages. Cell numbers were also quantified in the surrounding ground tissue (cortex plus endodermis) and epidermis (see Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online) tissue layers which are established during primary growth from the apical meristem. The ground tissue and epidermis layers were easily identified in cross-sections by their characteristic large cells, with a single cell layer of endodermis enclosed by a 4-5 cell thick cortex, in turn, enclosed by a single cell-layered epidermis (see Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). No significant difference was found in the number of cells comprising both the ground tissue and epidermis between the wild type and cycd3;1-3 (Fig. 4I), supporting the proposition that decreased cambium activity, as opposed to a defective apical meristem, was the major cause of the reduced vascular cell number and overall radial organ size in cycd3;1-3 stems.. Importantly, the vascular cell populations which exhibited the phenotypic effects upon loss of CYCD3 overlapped the domains in which CYCD3 genes were shown to be expressed (Fig. 2). To assess the status of mitotic cell cycle activity in developing vascular tissue in cycd3;1-3 stems, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to monitor the expression of the mitotic B-type cyclin gene CYCB1;1, a commonly-used marker of mitotic cell cycle activity during plant development (Colo-Carmona et al., 1999). Consistent with reduced cambial cell division in cycd3;1-3 stems, mutants showed reduced CYCB1;1 expression compared with the wild type in the middle and base of stems, an effect that was more pronounced in the stem base (Fig. 5), confirming that reduced cambial cell number in cycd3;1-3 stems is associated with reduced mitotic cell cycle activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CYCD3 plays a significant positive role in the regulation of cambium activity in the stem and that its loss leads to retarded secondary growth and reduced organ size.. .

Reverse transcription quantitative PCR was used to assay CYCB1;1 transcript abundance in the middle and base of 30-cm-long stems of wild-type and cycd3;1-3 plants using ACTIN2 as the endogenous reference gene. Relative transcript abundance is scaled to expression in the middle stem of the wild type. Error bars represent standard error.. . . . . . CYCD3 restrains cell expansion and differentiation of cambial cells into xylem cells. An additional phenotype that was noted at the stem base of cycd3;1-3 mutants was the presence of enlarged xylem cells, particularly those of vessels (Fig. 6A, B). Arabidopsis CYCD3 genes have been shown previously to mediate the balance between cell division and cell expansion during leaf development by regulating the duration of the mitotic window and the onset of cell expansion and associated endoreduplication events (Dewitte et al., 2007). To determine the overall effects of loss of CYCD3 function on cell expansion in the xylem cell lineage, xylem cell sizes in the stem base of 30-cm-tall cycd3;1-3 and wild-type plants was quantified. Overall, it was found that average xylem cell size in cycd3;1-3 was increased by approximately 13% (t test P <0.05) compared with the wild type (Fig. 6C). Consistent with an overall shift to increased xylem cell size, the mutant showed a greater range of cell sizes with a significant number of cells reaching sizes not seen in the wild type (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that loss of CYCD3 causes a significant enhancement in cell growth in developing xylem cells. The apparent enlargement of xylem cells observed in cycd3;1-3 stems suggested that the cellular transition from division to differentiation pathways in the xylem could be affected. To evaluate further the effects of loss of CYCD3 on the progression of vascular differentiation in stems, RT-qPCR was used to determine the expression of two well-characterized markers of xylem cell differentiation, SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN2 (SND2) and IRREGULAR XYLEM3 (IRX3) which, respectively, encode a transcription factor and a cellulose synthase gene that are tightly associated with xylem secondary cell wall biosynthesis (Brown et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2008). Consistent with an overall shift toward differentiation in the developing xylem of cycd3;1-3 stems, mutants showed an up-regulation of SND2 and IRX3 expression compared with the wild type of approximately 2.3-fold (130%) and 1.5-fold (50%), respectively, an effect that was more pronounced in the stem base (Fig. 6E, F).. .

Error bars represent standard error. ves, xylem vessels. Scale bars=100 mum (A, B).. . . . To exclude the possibility that the increased IRX3 and SND2 expression observed in the mutant was the result of an increase in the proportion of xylem cells (relative to the total of all other cell types) in the stem, the proportional contribution of xylem cells was calculated using data derived from stem cross-sections presented in Fig. 4I. The wild type had an average xylem cell number of 2605 and an average total number of all cell types of 6757.2, whereas the mutant had respective numbers of 1801.6 and 4553.2. Calculation of the proportion of xylem cells in stems showed both lines to be almost identical, with the wild type having 39% xylem (2605/6757.2) and the mutant having 40% xylem (1801.6/4553.2), ruling out an increase in the proportion of xylem cells as the cause of increased SND2 and IRX3 expression.. Importantly, the CYCD3 genes were shown to be specifically expressed in the cambium during stem vascular development and absent from older xylem cells (Fig. 2M, N), suggesting that a key point of regulation of cell expansion/differentiation processes by CYCD3 may occur in xylem cell precursors and their immediate progeny cells. Together, our data suggest that CYCD3 plays an important additional role in stem vascular development, in restraining cell expansion and differentiation in developing xylem cells..
PMC2566869	RESULTSTAV is responsible for CaMV infection-mediated interference with siR255 biogenesisCaMV infection in Arabidopsis thaliana causes overaccumulation of several RDR6-dependent precursors of TAS1-derived tasiRNA siR255 (35) (Figure 2). To test whether the CaMV TAV protein implicated in silencing suppression contributes to this effect, we analyzed two Arabidopsis transgenic lines that constitutively express TAV proteins from the CaMV strains CM1841 and D4 (lines CM-2 and D4-2, respectively) (38). Both lines accumulate comparable levels of TAV, but the CM1841 TAV plants develop extensive chlorotic symptoms, whereas the D4 plants are nearly symptom-less (38). Blot hybridization analysis of total plant RNA using the siR255-specific probe showed that both transgenic lines accumulate, in addition to the 21-nt siR255, several precursors ranging in size from 35 to 600 nt. The sizes and relative abundances of these RNAs were very similar in both transgenic lines as well as in control Col-0 (wt) plants infected with CaMV strain CM1841. Moreover, CaMV infection of the TAV transgenic lines did not alter these patterns of RNA accumulation (Figure 2). Notably, these long precursors of siR255 are also present in non-infected wt plants, albeit at very low levels (Figure 2 and data not shown). The levels of siR255 normalized for the U6 loading control were reduced to 55% of the wild-type levels in CaMV-infected plants. Of the two TAV transgenic lines, significant reduction in siR255 levels was observed only in the D4 line (see Figures 2 and 3). The stronger interference with siR255 biogenesis in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line was also apparent from a higher ratio of the siR255 precursors (a total of several RNAs ranging from 35 to 600 nt) to the 21 nt siR255 product, compared to the CM1841 line (Figure 2, see the imbedded table). Nonetheless, the CM1841 line accumulated somewhat higher amounts of the siR255 precursors.. Figure 2.Accumulation of tasiRNA precursors in CaMV-infected and TAV transgenic plants. Total RNA from pools of CaMV-infected (+) or mock-inoculated (-) wild-type plants (Col-0) and TAV transgenic lines CM1841 and D4 harvested 1 month post-inoculation were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization (using 15% PAGE). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes for the tasiRNAs TAS1a/b/c siR255, TAS3a 5D7(+), the miRNAs miR173, miR390 and miR828, CaMV-derived siRNAs and the small nuclear RNA U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). Positions of ssRNA markers are indicated. U6 signal serves as a loading control. The U6-normalized, relative levels of miRNAs are shown under the respective scan. The U6-normalized, relative levels of the tasiRNAs and the tasiRNA precursors (a total of several RNAs ranging from 35 to 600 nt) as well as the precursor/tasiRNA ratios are shown in the table. For each miRNA and tasiRNA, its accumulation in the uninfected, nontransgenic Arabidopsis (lane 1) was set to 1.0 (underlined). For the tasiRNA precursors, their accumulation was related to the corresponding tasiRNA.We made a time-course analysis of the TAV effect on the siR255-generating pathway using pools of the transgenic and the wt plants harvested 15, 30 and 45 days post-germination. Wt plants bolted and started to flower 30-45 days post-germination, whereas the transgenic lines displayed slower growth and flowered 1 (CM1841) or 2 (D4) months later, confirming earlier observations (32). In the CM1841 line, the siR255 precursors were equally abundant at all three time points. In contrast, the D4 line accumulated lower amounts of the precursors at the two earlier time points (Figure 3). Despite the difference in accumulation of the precursors, at each time point the precursors/tasiRNA ratio was about two to three times higher in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line (Figure 3), confirming that TAV expression in the D4 line has a stronger negative impact on tasiRNA processing. Interestingly, the levels of miR173 that initiates the siR255-generating pathway (Figure 1) were increased pronouncedly in the CM1841 line (Figure 3), thus correlating with higher accumulation of the siR255 precursors.. Figure 3.Differential impact of TAV proteins from CaMV strains CM1841 and D4 on TAS1 versus TAS3 tasiRNAs and their precursors. Total RNA from pools of noninfected, wild-type (Col-0) plants and TAV transgenic lines CM1841 and D4 harvested at 15, 30 and 45 days post-germination were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization (15% PAGE). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes for the tasiRNAs TAS1a/b/c siR255, TAS1a/b/c siR255*, TAS3a 5D7(+), TAS3a 5D7(-), the miRNAs miR173, miR390 and miR172, and U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). U6 signal serves as a loading control. The U6-normalized, relative levels of the tasiRNAs and the tasiRNA precursors (a total of several RNAs ranging from 35 to 600 nt) as well as the precursor/tasiRNA ratios are shown in the two tables. The U6-normalized, relative levels of miRNAs are shown under the respective scan. For each miRNA and tasiRNA, its accumulation in the nontransgenic Arabidopsis at day 15 (lane 1) was set to 1.0 (underlined). For the tasiRNA precursors, their accumulation was related to the corresponding tasiRNA.Further analysis of infected and TAV transgenic plants using probes specific for both strands of a presumed tasiRNA duplex (siR255/siR255*) detected longer RNAs identical in size and relative abundance but negligible levels of 21-nt siR255* (Figure 3). These results, and our earlier findings for CaMV-infected wt plants (35) (Figure 4) suggest that most larger-sized RNAs are potentially double-stranded molecules. Taken together, we conclude that the CaMV TAV protein is solely responsible for the CaMV-mediated interference with siR255 biogenesis.. Figure 4.Impact of CaMV infection on the biogenesis of tasiRNAs from different TAS loci. Total RNA from pools of CaMV-infected (+) and mock-inoculated wild type (Col-0) plants harvested 1 month post-inoculation were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization (15% PAGE). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes for the tasiRNAs TAS1a/b/c siR255, TAS1a/b/c siR255*, TAS1a/b 3D1(+), TAS1a/b 3D1(-), TAS2 siR612, TAS2 siR1940, TAS3a 5D7(+), the miRNA miR173, the 5S rDNA repeat-associated siRNA siR1003 and U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). U6 signal serves as a loading control. Positions of ssRNA markers are indicated. Asterisks indicate the dsRNAs hybridized to both the internal (TAS1a/b/c siR255- and siR255*-specific) and the miR173-terminal [TAS1a/b 3D1(+)- and 3D1(-)-specific] probes.Analysis of dsRNA precursors of TAS1 tasiRNAssiR255 is encoded by three TAS1 family loci TAS1a, TAS1b and TAS1c at processing positions 3D6(+), 3D6(+) and 3D3(+), respectively, located six, six and three 21-nt cycles downstream of the miR173 cleavage site (6). Four additional siR255-like species are encoded by TAS1a, TAS1b and TAS1c (Figure 1B, filled boxes). To further characterize the long RNAs that hybridize to the siR255- and the siR255*-specific probes in CaMV-infected plants (35), we re-probed the respective blot with P-32 labeled, 21- and 19-nt-long DNA oligonucleotides (Table S1) complementary to the predicted TAS1a 21-nt siRNAs 3D1(+) and 3D1(-) (Figure 1B). These probes are expected to hybridize to the termini of presumed dsRNAs from TAS1a and TAS1b with only 1-nt mismatch at the end but not to those from TAS1c and TAS2 with >4 mismatches. Such dsRNAs could be either the hypothetical full-length products of RDR6 activity or partially processed products from an end opposite to the miR173 cleavage site. We detected 21-nt TAS1a 3D1(+) species in both mock control and CaMV-infected plants, but no 3D1(-) species (Figure 4). Both TAS1a 3D1 (+) and 3D1(-) specific probes also strongly hybridized to four of the 12 longer RNAs detectable with siR255- and siR255*-specific probes in CaMV-infected plant samples (indicated with asterisks in Figure 4).We also analyzed the siR255 precursors in DCL-deficient single, double and triple mutants dcl2, dcl3, dcl4, dcl23, dcl34 and dcl234 as well as RDR-deficient mutants rdr2 and rdr6, described earlier (35). To better resolve longer precursors of tasiRNAs and identify single-stranded (ss) TAS1 transcripts of 800-1000 nt, total RNA was separated using 5% PAGE (Figure 5B) and low-molecular-weight RNAs were separated using 18% PAGE (Figure 5A). The size range of the single-stranded, siR255-containing RNAs we detected (Figure 5B) corresponded to TAS1a, 1b and 1c transcripts of 929, 838 and 989 nt in length, respectively. Strikingly, accumulation of most TAS1-derived RNAs was perturbed in the dcl4 mutant backgrounds relative to the wt and the other dcl mutants (Figure 5A and B). Thus, these RNAs may represent intermediates of DCL4-mediated processing of the longest (full-length) dsRNA precursors of 500-600 bp, which accumulated equally in the wt and all the dcl mutant plants infected with CaMV (Figure 5B). In the absence of DCL4, other DCLs appear to compensate for its deficiency: abundant 22-nt sRNA and several longer intermediates accumulating in dcl4 and dcl34 are DCL2-dependent (Figure 5A and B). The 24- and 25-nt sRNAs and two RNAs migrating at the ca. 80-nt position are DCL3-dependent (Figure 5A). The RNA pattern in dcl234 indicates that full-length precursors of siR255 are partially processed by DCL1 resulting in a distinct pattern of RNA intermediates but no detectable siRNAs (Figure 5). Finally, none of the precursors or mature TAS1 tasiRNAs was detected in rdr6 but all were detected in rdr2 (Figure 5A), showing that RDR6 is required for biogenesis of these tasiRNA precursors. Similar results were obtained for precursors and tasiRNAs encoded by TAS2 and TAS3 loci (data not shown).. Figure 5.Dissection of the siR255-generating pathway in CaMV-infected DCL- and RDR-deficient mutants. RNA samples from CaMV-infected wild type (Col-0), the single (dcl2-5, dcl3-1 and dcl4-2), double (dcl2 dcl3, dcl3 dcl4; 35) or triple (dcl2 dcl3 dcl4; 35) DCL-deficient and the RDR2- (rdr6-15) and the RDR6-deficient (rdr2-1) mutants harvested 1 month post-inoculation were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization using 18% PAGE for low-molecular-weight RNA (A) and 5% PAGE for total RNA (B). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes for TAS1a/b/c siR255, TAS1a/b/c siR255*, miR173, CaMV siRNAs and U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). U6 signal serves as a loading control. Positions of ssRNA markers are indicated. The dsRNAs hybridized to the miR173-terminal [TAS1a/b 3D1(+)- and 3D1(-)-specific] probes in Figure 4 are indicated by asterisks.CaMV infection and TAV expression interfere with the pathways generating the four known tasiRNA familiesWe also investigated if expression of the TAS2-TAS4 families was affected by CaMV infection. The single TAS2 locus encodes siR614 and siR1940 species as the fifth cycle duplex [3D5(+) and 3D5(-)] downstream of the miR173 site (6) (Figure 1B). In uninfected plants, the probes specific for these tasiRNAs identified the expected 21-nt molecules. CaMV infection induced the accumulation of four additional longer RNAs, whose sizes were similar in both polarities (Figure 4). A similar pattern of TAS2 long dsRNAs was found in the two TAV transgenic lines, with higher levels accumulating in the CM1841 line and a higher precursor/tasiRNA ratio in the D4 line (Figure S1). These findings indicate that CaMV infection and expression of TAV proteins interfere in a similar manner with miR173-initiated, TAS1 and TAS2 pathways.The miR390-initiated tasiRNAs are derived from three loci of the TAS3 family (Figure 1), with TAS3a giving rise to most of the sRNA reads (9). The TAS3a-specific tasiRNA 5D7(+) but not its passenger strand 5D7(-) was detected. Both sense and antisense probes detected long precursors of TAS3a tasiRNAs in CaMV-infected, but not mock-inoculated, wt plants and in both TAV transgenic lines (Figures 2 and 3). Note that these precursors were much less abundant in CaMV-infected plants than in the TAV transgenic lines (Figure 2). In contrast to TAS1 and TAS2, the TAS3a tasiRNA precursors were more abundant in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line and were inversely correlated in abundance with their mature tasiRNAs (Figure 3). Nonetheless, the precursors/tasiRNA ratio was comparable for both TAS3a and TAS1/TAS2 in the D4 line, whereas it was higher for TAS1/TAS2 than TAS3a in the CM1841 line (Figure 3). This suggests that TAV expression in the D4 line exerts strong and comparable effects on both the miR173- and the miR390-initiated tasiRNA biogenesis, whereas TAV expression in the CM1841 line has generally weaker effects on both but a more pronounced effect on the miR173-initiated tasiRNA biogenesis.The miR828-initiated tasiRNAs derived from the single TAS4 locus (11) are of very low abundance (9). We did not detect any small RNA in control Col-0 plants with the probes specific for the cloned 21 nt TAS4 siR81(-) species or its passenger strand. In both CaMV-infected and TAV transgenic plants, however, 24-26 nt small RNA of one polarity was detected using the siR81(-)-specific probe (Figures 4 and S1). This probe, but not its reverse complement (data not shown), detected long RNAs that were equally abundant in control and CaMV-infected plants, but overaccumulated in TAV transgenic plants. At least one distinct long RNA appears to be CaMV TAV-specific (indicated with asterisk in Figure S1). Thus, CaMV infection and TAV expression both interfere with the TAS4 biogenesis.CaMV infection and TAV expression upregulate both tasiRNA targets and components of tasiRNA biogenesisOur finding that TAV expression dramatically increased the accumulation of tasiRNA precursors and the ratio of precursors to tasiRNA suggests that TAV impairs processing of RDR6-dependent dsRNA to tasiRNA by DCL4. However, the levels of tasiRNAs themselves are not drastically reduced in CaMV-infected or TAV D4 plants, and, in some samples of the CM1841 plants, are even slightly increased (Figures 2 and 3). This could be due to incomplete spatial and/or temporal overlap of viral infection (TAV protein production) and the tasiRNA biogenesis and activity pathways. Additionally, a feedback regulation may partially or fully restore normal levels of tasiRNAs. We therefore investigated if the action of tasiRNAs in knocking down their target gene transcripts is affected and whether the genes mediating tasiRNA biogenesis are regulated in CaMV-infected and TAV transgenic plants. Using the ATH1 whole-genome microarray, we profiled total RNA from CaMV-infected versus mock-inoculated wt (Col-0) and tasiRNA-deficient dcl234 plants (harvested 1 month post-inoculation) as well as from non-infected transgenic versus wt (Col-0) plants harvested 15 days post-germination. Confirming the above time-course experiment (Figure 3), the siR255 precursors were more abundant in the CM1841 than in the D4 line samples (Figure S2; note that, of the two independent, CM1841 TAV-expressing lines shown, CM-2 was profiled). Notably, the TAV transgene transcript levels were higher in the D4 line than in the two CM1841 lines CM-2 and CM-6 (Figure S2), which is consistent with slightly higher accumulation of TAV protein and its breakdown products in this D4 line (D4-2) compared to the CM1841 lines (38; and data not shown). The higher expression of TAV protein in the D4 line might account for the stronger negative impact on tasiRNA biogenesis in this line as inferred above from the dsRNA precursors/tasiRNA ratios. However we cannot exclude that 5% difference at the amino acid level between the two TAV proteins is responsible for the observed effects.The microarray analysis showed that the key genes involved in tasiRNA biogenesis including DCL4, DRB4 and AGO7 were upregulated by both CaMV infection and TAV expression (Figure 6A, Table S2), thus supporting the feedback regulation hypothesis. Notably, the D4 line exhibited a more pronounced upregulation of these genes than the CM1841 line. Additionally, DCL1 and RDR6 were found to be modestly upregulated in the D4 line (Figure 6A, Table S2). The transcript levels of DRB4 and AGO7 were elevated to similar levels in both CaMV-infected wild-type and dcl234 plants (Figure 6A, Table S2). Interestingly, residual levels of a DCL4 transcript were detected in dcl234 carrying a T-DNA insertion in the 23rd exon of the DCL4 gene and those were also slightly elevated upon CaMV infection. Furthermore, DCL1 was also modestly upregulated in CaMV-infected dcl234 (Figure 6A, Table S2). Other genes presently implicated in the miRNA- and tasiRNA-generating pathways, namely AGO1, HYL1/DRB1, HEN1, SE, SGS3 and SDE5 were not affected by the CaMV challenges. Of the silencing-related genes not implicated in the tasiRNA pathway so far, notable CaMV-mediated upregulation was found for AGO2, TOUSLED, NRPD1a, DDM1, DME, HDA18, RPA2 and FAS2, whereas DRB3 was downregulated (data not shown).. Figure 6.Response of the Arabidopsis transcriptome to CaMV infection and TAV transgene expression reveals the interference with the tasiRNA and secondary siRNA pathways. The microarray analysis data for CaMV-infected (+) and mock-inoculated (-) Arabidopsis wt (Col-O) and the dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple mutant (dcl234) plants as well as for the CaMV TAV transgenic lines CM1841 and D4 are presented as the bar charts with error bars showing standard deviation from mean value of the normalized expression levels (Tables S2-S4) of the genes upregulated in response both to CaMV infection (in Col-0 and dcl234) and TAV expression (in CM1841 and/or D4). The data are for two samples, each representing a pool of three (or, in the case of TAV transgenic lines, nine) plants. The statistically significant changes are indicated by asterisks. (A) shows the genes mediating tasiRNA biogenesis (DCL4, DRB4, AGO7, DCL1 and RDR6), (B) the genes targeted by tasiRNAs of the four TAS families (indicated in brackets) and (C) the miRNA targets (the miRNA indicated in brackets) and other genes silenced by secondary siRNAs.Further analysis of the microarrays revealed that several predicted tasiRNA target genes were modestly upregulated by CaMV infection (Figure 6B, Table S3). These included (i) two expressed protein genes targeted by siR255 and three other tasiRNAs encoded by the TAS1 a/b/c loci, (ii) six PPR genes targeted by single or multiple siRNAs derived from TAS1a or TAS2 loci, (iii) AFR4 targeted by two TAS3a siRNAs and (iv) MYB113 targeted by the TAS4 siR81(-). Thus, subsets of the targets for all the known TAS families were elevated. Most of these were also upregulated in noninfected dcl234 plants, consistent with the tasiRNA deficiency. Interestingly, the target genes unaffected in the noninfected dcl234 plants were upregulated when these plants were infected with CaMV (Figure 6B, Table S3). Subsets of targets for tasiRNA in all four TAS families were also elevated in TAV transgenic lines (Figure 6B, Table S3). The target genes affected and the degree of upregulation depended on both the TAV line and the TAS family. The CM1841 TAV expression had the most pronounced effect on the TAS4 targets with all three known targets of siR81(-) being strongly upregulated, while its effect on the TAS1 and TAS3 targets was less pronounced and on the TAS2 targets rather negligible. In contrast, the D4 TAV expression had almost no effect on the TAS4 targets, whereas most of the TAS2 targets were strongly upregulated (Figure 6B, Table S3). Furthermore, one of the two TAS1 targets and the TAS3 target ARF4 were more pronouncedly upregulated in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line, and the D4 line showed slightly elevated levels of the second TAS3 target, ARF3 (Figure 6B, Table S3).The gene At2g39680 imbedded within TAS2 (At2g39681) in opposite orientation (7) was upregulated upon CaMV infection and in both TAV transgenic lines (Figure 6B, Table S3). Together with the earlier report on its upregulation in rdr6 (41), our data suggest that At2g39680 is a target of TAS2-derived tasiRNAs, the biogenesis of which is impaired by CaMV TAV.Many targets of tasiRNAs give rise to RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs, likely to be involved in amplification of silencing (9). Thus, CaMV TAV-mediated interference with secondary siRNA production could account for upregulation of some of the tasiRNA targets (Table S3). Our further inspection of the transcriptome profiles revealed that both CaMV infection and TAV expression (in one or both lines) cause upregulation of several other Arabidopsis genes (Figure 6C, Table S4) that normally give rise to RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs (9). Interestingly, many of these genes are targets of miRNAs, like the TAS genes themselves. Notably, TAV expression in the D4 line elevated transcript levels for most of these genes, whereas the CM1841 line showed elevated levels for only a few of them (Figure 6C), which is similar to the above observations for the TAS2 targets (Figure 6B). The vast majority of other miRNA targets, which does not give rise to secondary siRNAs, was not upregulated in CaMV-infected or TAV transgenic plants (data not shown), suggesting that TAV does not interfere with miRNA action. The notable exception is AGO1, which represents an miRNA target gene generating secondary siRNAs that was not upregulated by TAV (data not shown). However, expression of this gene is auto-regulated at both post-transcriptional and transcriptional levels by a complex fine-tuning mechanism (42), which could fully compensate for the inhibitory effect of TAV.CaMV interferes with production of RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs from a silenced transgeneOur transcriptome analysis suggests that TAV interferes with RDR6-dependent secondary siRNA pathways. To test this hypothesis we used the Arabidopsis GFP  GF-FG transgenic line (22), which carries a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and a second transgene expressing an inverted repeat cognate to the GF portion of the GFP coding region (GF-FG). In this system, the 21-nt primary siRNAs produced by DCL4-mediated processing of the GF-FG dsRNA are thought to target the GFP transcript for cleavage and degradation. The latter process triggers RDR6-dependent production of secondary siRNAs from the P region of the GFP transgene (Figure 7A). The rdr6 mutation introduced into the GFP  GF-FG line has been shown to eliminate the secondary siRNAs without affecting accumulation of primary siRNAs or GFP silencing (22). CaMV infection of the GFP  GF-FG line did not result in re-appearance of GFP fluorescence under UV light (data not shown), indicating that GFP silencing was not suppressed. Consistent with the silenced GFP phenotype, RNA blot hybridization of total plant RNA with probes specific to the GF region showed that accumulation of primary siRNAs of both polarities was not reduced but rather slightly increased (Figure 7B). In contrast, accumulation of secondary siRNAs from the P region was substantially reduced during viral infection (Figure 7B). These results suggest that CaMV infection selectively interferes with the biogenesis of RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs without any substantial effect on the production of primary siRNAs and their action in silencing GFP expression.. Figure 7.CaMV infection interferes with the biogenesis of secondary siRNAs derived from the GFP transgene silenced by GF-FG dsRNA. (A) Model for the biogenesis of the primary (GF) and the secondary (P) siRNAs derived from the GF-FG and the GFP transgenes, respectively, in the transgenic GF-FG  GFP line. The structures of the two transgenes present in this line as shown schematically, with the CaMV 35S promoter indicated by an arrow shape. In the GF-FG transgene the inverted repeat of the GF region of the GFP coding sequence is equipped with an intron. The Pol II transcription generates a GF-FG transcript that folds back into perfect dsRNA. The latter is processed by DCL4 (and DCL3) into primary siRNAs (GF). These siRNAs target in trans a GFP mRNA transcribed from the GFP transgene for cleavage at multiple positions within the GF region. The 3-product of these cleavage events retaining an intact P region is converted by RDR6 into dsRNA. The resulting dsRNA is processed by DCL4 (and DCL3) into secondary siRNAs (P). The later step is selectively impaired by CaMV infection as inferred from the following experiment.(B) Total RNA from CaMV-infected (+) and mock-inoculated (-) transgenic GF-FG X GFP line plants harvested 1 month post-inoculation were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization (15% PAGE). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes specific for sense and antisense siRNAs derived from the GF and P regions of the GFP coding sequence and U6 (see Table S1 for probe details). U6 signal serves as a loading control. The U6-normalized, relative levels of siRNAs are shown under the respective scans. In each case, the siRNA accumulation in the noninfected Arabidopsis was set to 1.0 (underlined)..
PMC3123461	Results. By cross-fertilization of the four T-DNA-insertion lines Gabi 450D10 (miox1), Salk 040608 (miox2), Salk 018395 (miox4) and Salk 112535 (miox5) we obtained a miox1/2/4/5 quadruple mutant. MIOX3 (At4g26255) is a transcribed but truncated and highly mutated pseudogene. The mRNA sequence has only partial homology to the neighbouring MIOX4-gene and contains numerous stop codons in all three reading frames. In the miox1/2/4/5-mutant a PCR-product of the predicted size was obtained for all four MIOX genes using the left border T-DNA (LB-T-DNA) insertion primer and a suitable MIOX isoform specific primer, consistent with the integration of a T-DNA in each MIOX gene (Fig.2a). Homozygosity of the miox1/2/4/5-mutant was tested with MIOX gene specific primer pairs, spanning each T-DNA insertion site. Absence of the intact wild type genes can be proven for all four gene loci (Fig.2a).Fig.2Genetic characterization of wild type and miox1/2/4/5-mutant. a Ethidium bromide strained PCR bands verifying the genetic identity of the quadruple knockout in miox1/2/4/5. b T-DNA insertion sites in the genes of the MIOX isoforms. The upper scheme shows the relation of MIOX isoforms (grey boxes exons) and the sites of T-DNA insertions. MIOX1: Gabi-Kat, MIOX2, 4, and 5 SALK. The arrow indicates the position of the translation start codon, the asterisks marks the stop codon. The lower part of the illustration shows the exact location of the T-DNA insertion. This information is derived from resequencing the junction site between the MIOX gene and the LB of the T-DNA. For MIOX1, the insertion site is ~30bp upstream of a splice site; MIOX2 and 5 are even closer to splice sites; the SALK lines for MIOX2 and MIOX4 are located in an intron; the former again close to a splice site. c Expression profile of MIOX isoforms. Realtime PCR data of wild type and miox1/2/4/5-mutant material are displayed to depict the transcript distribution of MIOX relative to a housekeeping gene in three different stages of development: in seedlings, leaves, and in flowers (please note the different scale for flower transcripts indicating the far higher higher expression in this organ). Total relative amounts of transcripts were calculated and the ratio of miox1/2/4/5-mutant to wild type was formed. The level of MIOX transcripts is highly reduced in miox1/2/4/5-mutant. The experiment was performed in triplicates; shown are means and standard deviations. . Transcript profiling. RNA was isolated from wild type and miox1/2/4/5-mutant plants to compare the transcript levels of the four MIOX genes in both plant lines. Due to the highly transient nature of MIOX expression particularly in flowers as seen in GUS reporter gene plants (Kanter et al. 2005), we performed the analysis with different organs. The wild type data correspond well with data available at Genevestigator (http://www.genevestigator.com; data not shown).. In the miox1/2/4/5-mutant, we were able to detect transcripts of MIOX1, MIOX4 and MIOX5; leaving MIOX2 as the only isoform that is knocked out while the others are severely reduced in their transcript levels but not completely knocked out (Fig.2c). Subcloning of the left border T-DNA insertion sites and ensuing sequencing revealed that the insertions are located close to splice sites or, in the case of MIOX2 and MIOX4, even in an intron sequence (see Fig.2b). For the qPCR experiments (MIOX1, 2, 4) we used primer pairs spanning the T-DNA insertion sites. The residual transcripts (Fig.2c) suggest the presence of residual full length mRNAs. Interestingly, we see that in the miox1/2/4/5-mutant MIOX4 is expressed in tissues where it is normally not expressed in the wild type (compare Fig.2c). Still, the total amount of MIOX transcripts that can be rescued in the miox1/2/4/5-mutant is between 2 (flowers) and 14% (in leaves).. We assumed that a disruption of the MIOX pathway should have consequences for inositol metabolism and cell wall composition. This can be visualized when miox1/2/4/5-mutant and wild type plantlets are grown on either inositol-free MS (control) or on medium with 1gL-1 inositol: The lines differ strongly; while the wild type can utilize inositol as additional carbon source and shows increased growth at the same age, miox1/2/4/5-mutant seedlings are significantly less developed and resemble the condition without inositol (Fig.3). A small increase in growth of miox1/2/4/5-mutant on myo-inositol plates may be caused by the small residual MIOX-activity.Fig.3Utilization of inositol. Wild type seedlings can utilize inositol as additional carbon source for growth, miox1/2/4/5-mutant seedlings cannot. Wt seeds on the right side of each dish, miox1/2/4/5-mutant seeds on the left side. Left inositol-free MS medium, right MS medium supplied with 1gL-1 inositol. UDP-xylose, UDP-arabinose and UDP-galacturonic acid are derivatives of UDP-glucuronic acid. Therefore, a change in cell wall composition in miox1/2/4/5 lacking MIOX activity seemed possible. However, HPLC analysis of hydrolyzed cell wall material failed to exhibit the reduction in these sugar residues in miox1/2/4/5-mutant cell walls compared to the wild type (Fig.4a). As the MIOX genes are predominantly expressed in flowers and also in developing seeds we also tested the composition of seed coat mucilage, which also shows no significantly altered sugar composition (Fig.4b).Fig.4Sugar composition for cell wall (a) and seed mucilage (b). Even though MIOX activity is related to cell wall biosynthesis, composition of cell wall and seed mucilage in miox1/2/4/5-mutant does not deviate significantly from the wild type. Shown are means and standard deviations of four replicates. . . Inositol feeding experiments in leaf discs. Experiments with leaf discs floating on inositol-enriched medium document rapid uptake of free inositol as described by Schneider et al. (2006). During the feeding situation, the miox1/2/4/5-mutant accumulated more free inositol after 2h of feeding than the wild type (data not shown). The inositol concentration in both lines rapidly dropped down after the feeding of inositol was stopped. To be able to follow the fed inositol, we performed a similar feeding experiment with [3H]-inositol. Figure5a shows that while all plant lines take up roughly the same total amount of label, wild type and L2 (CaMV35S::MIOX4 overexpressor line L2; Lorence et al. 2004) incorporate approximately 40% of it into the cell wall; in miox1/2/4/5-mutant the majority (~95%)of the 3H-label remains in the soluble fraction. We tried to further analyze the signal present in the aqueous phase: by evaporation experiments we were able to exclude the possibility of 3H2O as the source for the label. Incubation with anion or cation exchange beads (Bio-Rex MSZ 501(D) resin, Biorad), respectively, showed that no radioactive metabolite bound to the ion-exchange resin, which indicates that the fed [3H]-inositol is not present in a free ionic form. This suggests low amounts of inositol-phosphates in the aqueous phase under these conditions, which were not detectable under our conditions. Extraction with chloroform indicated that a small fraction of the total incorporated label is present in a hydrophobic form in all plant lines tested without showing quantitative differences (data not shown).Fig.5Incorporation of 3H-myo-inositol. a Distribution of label during short-term incubation of leaf discs. Leaf discs were floated for 3h on MS supplemented with 3H-myo-inositol and chased for 1h with cold inositol. The total amount of label found in the three lines is similar. The gain-of-function mutant line L2 expressing a CaMV35S::MIOX4 construct incorporates slightly more signal into the cell wall than the wild type; the majority of signal detected in the miox1/2/4/5-mutant is retained in the soluble fraction. b Distribution of label in 7-day-old seedlings. Seedlings were grown in liquid MS supplemented with 3H-myo-inositol. The crude extract was split into pellet and supernatant; the pellet was washed several times to obtain the cell wall fraction; the supernatant was mixed with acetone to retain soluble sugars in the supernatant while precipitating oligosaccharides. The amount of signal in the cell wall of the miox1/2/4/5-mutant is highly reduced compared to the wild type; instead, more signal is found as soluble carbohydrate or acetone precipitate. The experiment was performed in triplicates; shown are means and standard deviations. . . Inositol feeding experiments in seedlings. To clarify the identity of the soluble label and the residual signal in the miox1/2/4/5-mutant cell wall fraction, we grew seedlings on medium with [3H]-inositol. The distribution of 3H-label between the soluble and insoluble fraction is shown in Fig.5b. We included a second fractionation step of the aqueous supernatant, a precipitation with 80% acetone, to separate soluble inositol from precipitable galactinol. HPLC analysis confirmed that the radioactive signal in soluble fraction is attributed to inositol and galactinol (data not shown).. Next, we turned our attention to the cell wall fraction. To exclude the possibility of starch as signal source, we performed a digestion with alpha-amylase and amyloglucosidase. This procedure released roughly one-fifth of the signal from the insoluble fraction, but this observation was made in wild type as well as miox1/2/4/5-mutant samples. The necessary incubation in slightly acid buffer also releases part of the pectic fraction and possibly also some arabinogalactan proteins. TFA hydrolysis of the cell wall fraction was performed to investigate whether the pattern of labelled sugars is altered in miox1/2/4/5-mutant compared to wild type samples. Figure6 shows the HPLC elution profile in the upper portion and the scintillation counts of the collected fractions in the lower portion of each graph. Note that the scale for the radioactivity counts (right Y-axis) is tenfold lower for the miox1/2/4/5-mutant than for the wild type, confirming the >90% reduction of myo-inositol conversion into cell wall sugars in the miox1/2/4/5-mutant. Signal is found for inositol and the GlcA derivatives GalA, Ara and Xyl. GlcA itself is probably present in too small a concentration to elicit a signal (compare the amount in Fig.4a). An unidentified signal, presumably resulting from incompletely hydrolyzed sugars, is released from the column during the transition from solely alkaline buffer to a buffer solution that also contains sodium acetate (the corresponding electrochemical signal is seen in the HPLC elution profile as well).Fig.6Distribution of label among cell wall monomers. Labelled cell wall pellets of wild type (upper panel) and miox1/2/4/5-mutant (lower panel) were characterized via HPLC (line), fractionated, and scintillation counted (columns). 1 Fuc, 2 Rha, 3 Ara, 4 Gal, 5 Glc, 6 Xyl, 7 GalA. Asterisks signal from buffer change. Please note the different scale for radioactive metabolites, used for wild type and miox1/2/4/5-mutant plants. As we found no changes in the cell wall composition in miox1/2/4/5-mutant compared to wild type despite the block via the MIOX enzymes, we measured the transcripts of UGD, the key enzyme acting in a parallel reaction pathway leading to UDP-GlcA. UGD-genes are up-regulated (~1.5-fold in seedlings and leaves) in the context of our miox1/2/4/5-mutant-to the greatest extent in the flower (~3-fold), where the lack of MIOX transcript must be most pronounced. The increase in UGD transcripts results in approximately 15% higher UGD activity in flowers. The lack of a visible phenotype in the miox1/2/4/5-mutant is likely explained by the compensatory effect of increased UGD activity and the residual activity of MIOX in the miox1/2/4/5-mutant.. . . Metabolite profiling. Investigation of the RFOs, biosynthetic pathway is shown in Suppl. Fig. S1, shows an increase in miox1/2/4/5-mutant leaves under standard conditions which can even be elicited to a greater extend when salt stress is applied. In L2 (MIOX overexpressor), where the level of free inositol is lower due to increased MIOX activity, the response to salt stress is somewhat weaker than in the wild type (Fig.7).Fig.7Salt-stress treatment leads to an increase of inositol and derivatives. Soluble carbohydrates were extracted from young leaves of 6-week-old plants 5days after watering them with 150mM NaCl (induced samples). Wild type plants, the miox1/2/4/5-mutant and a CaMV35::MIOX4 overexpressor line (L2) are compared. As a control served a set of plants that received tap water instead (not induced). Accumulation for inositol (a), galactinol (b) and raffinose (c) is presented. Shown are means and standard deviation of three independent experiments. In seeds, the changes are displayed even more intensely: approximately 50 more free inositol and 5 more galactinol is present in miox1/2/4/5-mutant seeds compared to the wild type. Raffinose content is the same, and stachyose is reduced. We also observed that the content of phytic acid, the inositol-hexakisphosphate which serves as ion chelator and phosphate-storage molecule, is higher in miox1/2/4/5-mutant than in wild type or an overexpressing line (Fig.8a, b).Fig.8Seed sugar content. a Inositol and RFO content in seeds. The miox1/2/4/5-mutant shows highly increased levels of free inositol and the galactosylated inositol galactinol. b Phytic acid content in seeds of wild type, miox1/2/4/5-mutant and a CaMV35::MIOX4 overexpressor line (L2). The level of the fully phosphorylated inositol-derivative phytic acid is elevated in miox1/2/4/5-mutant and reduced in the MIOX4-overexpressing line L2. A t test shows significant (P<0.05) differences between samples, despite the large SD. Shown are means and SDs of triplicates. . . Seedling characterization. Based on these findings, we decided to conduct a series of germination experiments (the data is summed up in Suppl. Fig. S2). First, we measured the inositol content in seedlings grown on media with differing inositol contents. This clearly demonstrated that the miox1/2/4/5-mutant plantlets not only accumulate externally applied inositol, but that their intrinsic level of autonomously synthesized inositol is high even at conditions where no free inositol can be detected in the wild type or L2 (MIOX overexpressor). Second, we performed a basic stress treatment with two concentrations of NaCl (50 and 150mM). miox1/2/4/5-mutant is more sensitive than the wild type. This is a bit surprising since inositol and RFOs are interpreted as osmolytes which should convey a greater resistance to such stresses-not the greater susceptibility we see in this experiment. Third, we incubated seeds on phosphate-free MS medium, assuming that the increased level of phytic acid seen in miox1/2/4/5-mutant seeds enables them to deal better with this situation. Indeed, we see a slightly higher growth rate in miox1/2/4/5-mutant seedlings compared to the wild type.. . . Adult plant characterization. The RFOs are discussed to be involved in stress tolerance. Nishizawa et al. (2008) found plants with high galactinol and raffinose contents less susceptible to oxidative stress as measured via chlorophyll quenching after treatment with methylviologen. We repeated this experiment with our miox1/2/4/5-mutant line, but could not detect a similar protective effect of its elevated galactinol and raffinose content compared to the wild type, neither in standard (not shown) nor in high light conditions (Suppl. Fig. S3a).. Rohde et al. (2004) saw a correlation between high raffinose levels and increased freezing tolerance. We assumed that the elevated level of raffinose even at standard growth conditions might convey a similar freezing tolerance to our miox1/2/4/5-mutant plants. However, determination of the percentage of ion leakage did not result in significantly differing values (Suppl. Fig. S3b).. In a third line of experiments, we investigated the correlation of MIOX activity and ascorbic acid content as postulated in Lorence et al. (2004). The authors stated that three independent lines expressing a CaMV35S::MIOX4 construct had an up to threefold elevated ascorbic acid content in foliar tissue. We have conducted experiments comprising wild type plants, the same MIOX overexpressing plants, our miox1/2/4/5-mutant and vtc1 plants with a published content of ~30% of wild type ascorbic acid levels (Conklin et al. 1997), serving as a control. We measured their intrinsic foliar ascorbate under standard growth conditions and monitored it while feeding excess inositol (this data is shown in Suppl. Fig. S4) and during application of light stress (Suppl. Fig. S3c). Under all conditions tested, neither the MIOX overexpressing line(s) (L2 is shown representatively) nor the miox1/2/4/5-mutant with only marginal MIOX activity deviated significantly from wild type levels. Only the vtc1 mutant defective in the mannose-pathway leading to ascorbic acid showed the expected decreased content.. We also performed analysis of starch and soluble sugar content in adult leaf tissue, indicating that the central carbon metabolism is not affected in miox1/2/4/5-mutant or L2 MIOX overexpressor plants, since starch, glucose and sucrose levels are the same as in the wild type (data is shown in Suppl. Fig. S5)..
PMC3139611	Results. . PsLSD1 is involved in negatively regulating PCD. Previously, we cloned a reduced glutathione (GSH)-induced pea cDNA, which encodes a LITAF domain protein, and named it Pisum sativa GSH-induced LITAF domain protein (PsGILP; GenBank accession number: AAY40471.1). To identify PsGILP-interacting proteins, we used yeast two-hybrid screen to clone a pea cDNA (GenBank accession number: HQ006097). This cDNA encodes a putative protein homologous to AtLSD1 (with 72% identity), and thus was designated as PsLSD1 (Pisum sativa LSD1). The predicted PsLSD1 has 176 amino acid residues and contains three LSD1-type zinc finger motifs (Figure S1).. To investigate the function of PsLSD1, we identified an Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion line of AtLSD1 (SALK_042687, designated as lsd1-2) (Figure 1A), and obtained two independent transgenic lines over-expressing PsLSD1 in the homozygous lsd1-2 mutant (Figure 1B). We sprayed wild-type (WT), lsd1-2, and the transgenic lines with SA, which can induce PCD in lsd1-2, but not in WT [9]. By 5 days post-SA spray, lsd1-2 leaves were collapsed and completely dried, indicating significant cell death. In contrast, WT and the transgenic lines were healthy and green (Figure 1C). We quantified cell death by measuring cellular ion leakage, which correlates with plant cell death [20]. As shown in Figure 1D, lsd1-2 displayed a significant increase in conductivity, whereas the transgenic lines were basically the same as WT and exhibited only a very slight increase in conductivity. Thus, over-expression of PsLSD1 could rescue SA-induced PCD of lsd1-2, indicating that PsLSD1 is involved in negatively regulating PCD.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022131.g001. Figure 1. . PsLSD1 is involved in negatively regulating PCD.. (A) RT-PCR analysis of the expression of AtLSD1 in the lsd1-2 mutant. AtUBQ10 was used as an internal control.

Various transgenic lines are numbered; NC and LC represent negative control and loading control, respectively. (C) Lesion phenotypes of various plant lines after SA treatment. Leaves were photographed at 5 days post-SA spray. Each leaf shown is a representative of about 30 leaves in three independent experiments. (D) Ion leakage profiles of various plant lines after SA treatment. At 3 days post-SA spray, conductivity of leaf discs from various plant lines was measured at the indicated time. SD indicates four independent data points. The experiment was performed three times with similar results.. . . . . . PsLSD1 is localized in the nucleus. To determine subcellular localization of PsLSD1, we constructed a fusion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and PsLSD1 driven by the CaMV 35S promoter (Figure 2A), and transfected Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts with the resulting construct. As shown in Figure 2B, GFP alone was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas GFP-PsLSD1 was exclusively localized in the nucleus. This result indicates that PsLSD1 is localized in the nucleus.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022131.g002. Figure 2. . The NLS of PsLSD1 is located in the three LSD1-type zinc finger motifs.. (A) Schematic diagram of GFP-tagged PsLSD1 and its deletion mutants. zf1, zf2, and zf3 indicate the first, second, and third zinc finger motif, respectively. NTD and CTD represent the N- and C-terminal domain, respectively. (B) PsLSD1 is localized in the nucleus. (C) The N-terminal domain is sufficient and necessary for PsLSD1 nuclear localization. (D) All the three zinc finger motifs are necessary for PsLSD1 nuclear localization. (E) Tertiary structure of each zinc finger motif is essential for PsLSD1 nuclear localization. ZF1CA, ZF2CA, and ZF3CA indicate the mutation of the second cysteine to alanine within the first, second, and third zinc finger motif, respectively. (F) Basic residues of each zinc finger motif are essential for PsLSD1 nuclear localization. ZF1RA, ZF2RA, and ZF3RA indicate the mutation of the first arginine to alanine within the first, second, and third zinc finger motif, respectively. Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were transfected with the indicated constructs, and samples were stained with DAPI to indicate positions of nuclei. Fluorescent images were taken at 12-16 h after transfection. Each protoplast shown is a representative of at least twenty protoplasts in three independent experiments. Epifluorescence (left), DAPI (middle), and merged (right) images are shown. Scale bar is 20 m.. . . . . . The NLS of PsLSD1 lies within the three zinc finger motifs. No classical NLS was found in the amino acid sequence of PsLSD1. To identify the NLS of PsLSD1, its two domains were separately fused to GFP: the N-terminal domain (NTD, aa 1-105) containing three LSD1-type zinc finger motifs, and the C-terminal domain (CTD, aa 106-176) (Figure 2A). As shown in Figure 2C, GFP-PsLSD1NTD was found predominantly in the nucleus, whereas GFP-PsLSD1CTD was found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This result indicates that the N-terminal domain is sufficient and necessary for PsLSD1 nuclear localization.. Since the N-terminal domain of PsLSD1 contains three zinc finger motifs, we next asked which zinc finger motifs are necessary for PsLSD1 nuclear localization. To address this question, we generated three constructs expressing GFP-tagged deletion mutants of PsLSD1 under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter: GFP-PsLSD1deltaZF1 in which aa 1 to 28 were deleted, GFP-PsLSD1deltaZF2 in which aa 46 to 67 were deleted, and GFP-PsLSD1deltaZF3 in which aa 84 to 105 were deleted (Figure 2A). Like GFP, GFP-PsLSD1deltaZF1, GFP-PsLSD1deltaZF2, and GFP-PsLSD1deltaZF3 were distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 2D), indicating that all the three zinc finger motifs are essential for PsLSD1 nuclear localization. Taken together, these results suggest that the three zinc finger motifs are the NLS of PsLSD1.. . . Tertiary structure of zinc finger motifs is essential for PsLSD1 nuclear localization. The four zinc-chelating cysteine residues are involved in binding to zinc ion, and thus are essential for tertiary structure of LSD1-type zinc finger motif. To determine whether zinc finger structure is essential for PsLSD1 nuclear localization, we generated three constructs in which the second zinc-chelating cysteine within each zinc finger is mutated to alanine to disrupt zinc finger structure, and analyzed their subcellular localization. As shown in Figure 2E, GFP-PsLSD1ZF1CA, GFP-PsLSD1ZF2CA, and GFP-PsLSD1ZF3CA were distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This result indicates that the tertiary structure of each zinc finger motif is essential for PsLSD1 nuclear localization.. . . Basic residues of zinc finger motifs are essential for PsLSD1 nuclear localization. The primary amino acid sequence of PsLSD1 zinc finger motifs contains only seven basic residues: two, three, and two basic residues are present in the first, second, and third zinc fingers, respectively (Figures S1). To examine the role of basic residues in PsLSD1 nuclear localization, we generated three constructs in which the first arginine within each zinc finger is mutated to alanine, and analyzed their subcellular localization. As shown in Figure 2F, GFP-PsLSD1ZF1RA, GFP-PsLSD1ZF2RA and GFP-PsLSD1ZF3RA were distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This result indicates that basic residues within the zinc finger motifs are essential for PsLSD1 nuclear localization.. . . The NLS of PsLSD1 binds to importin alpha. To elucidate how the NLS of PsLSD1 is involved in the nuclear import of PsLSD1, we analyzed the possible interaction between the NLS of PsLSD1 and nuclear import protein importin alpha, which recognizes the classical NLSs. The Arabidopsis genome contains nine genes encoding importin alpha isoforms [21]. We initially analyzed the interactions between four of these importin alpha isoforms (AtIMPalpha1, AtIMPalpha2, AtIMPalpha3, and AtIMPalpha4) and PsLSD1. Yeast two-hybrid assay showed that all these four importin alpha proteins associated with PsLSD1 (Figure 3A). To confirm the interaction between PsLSD1 and importin alpha, we performed in vitro GST pull-down assay. Very little MBP-PsLSD1 protein was pulled-down by GST-bound beads, whereas significantly more MBP-PsLSD1 protein was pulled-down by GST-AtIMPalpha1-bound beads (Figure 3B), indicating that PsLSD1 binds to AtIMPalpha1 in vitro.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022131.g003. Figure 3. . The NLS of PsLSD1 is involved in interacting with importin alpha.. (A) PsLSD1 interacts with AtIMPalpha1, AtIMPalpha2, AtIMPalpha3, and AtIMPalpha1 in yeast. pGBK-AtIMPalpha1, pGBK-AtIMPalpha2, pGBK-AtIMPalpha3, pGBK-AtIMPalpha4, and pGBKT7 were co-transformed with pGAD-PsLSD1 into yeast AH109 respectively, and beta-galactosidase activity of the resulting clones was measured. T+p53 and T+Lam are positive and negative controls for the yeast two-hybrid assay, respectively. (B) PsLSD1 directly binds to AtIMPalpha1 in vitro. Purified MBP-PsLSD1 was incubated with GST or GST-AtIMPalpha1 bound to glutathione particles. Pulled-down proteins and Input sample (purified MBP-PsLSD1) were detected by Western blot using an anti-MBP polyclonal antibody. (C) PsLSD1 interacts with AtIMPalpha1 in vivo. YN-AtIMPa1 was co-transfected with YC and YC-PsLSD1 into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, respectively, and samples were stained with DAPI to indicate positions of nuclei. Fluorescent images were taken at 12-16 h after transfection. Each protoplast shown is a representative of at least twenty protoplasts in two independent experiments. BF indicates Bright Field, and scale bar is 20 m.. . . . To further verify the interaction between PsLSD1 and AtIMPalpha1, we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in Arabidopsis protoplasts. As shown in Figure 3C, no fluorescence signal was observed in protoplasts co-expressing YN-AtIMPalpha1 and YC-HA (upper panel), whereas the fluorescence signal was detected in the nucleus of protoplasts co-expressing YN-AtIMPalpha1 and YC-PsLSD1 (bottom panel). This result indicates that PsLSD1 associates with AtIMPalpha1 in vivo. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PsLSD1 associates with importin alpha.. Next we carried out GST pull-down assay to analyze the interaction between the NLS of PsLSD1 and AtIMPalpha1. Figure 4 showed that the N-terminal domain, which served as the NLS, but not the C-terminal domain of PsLSD1 directly bound to AtIMPalpha1 in vitro; the N-terminal domain of PsLSD1 bound to AtIMPalpha1 with a greater intensity than full length PsLSD1 did (Figure 4). Moreover, deletion of the first, second, or third zinc finger significantly decreased the binding of PsLSD1 to At IMPalpha1 (Figure 4), suggesting that the zinc fingers are involved in direct interaction with importin alpha. Thus, our data suggest that the NLS of PsLSD1 directly binds to importin alpha in vitro.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0022131.g004. Figure 4. . The NLS of PsLSD1 associates with AtIMPalpha1 in vitro.. Purified MBP-PsLSD1, MBP, MBP-PsLSD1NTD, MBP-PsLSD1CTD, MBP-PsLSD1deltaZF1, MBP-PsLSD1deltaZF2, and MBP-PsLSD1deltaZF3 were incubated with GST-AtIMPalpha1 or GST (control) bound to MagneGST glutathione particles, respectively. Pulled-down proteins and Input sample (purified MBP fusion proteins) were detected by Western blot using an anti-MBP polyclonal antibody. The experiments were performed two times with similar results..
PMC2738679	Results. Pathogenesis-related gene GmPR1 is induced following treatment of soybean plants with the SAR inducer, 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) or infection with the oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora sojae. In P. sojae-infected plants, SAR was induced against the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea. Soybean GmNPR1-1 and GmNPR1-2 genes showed high identities to Arabidopsis NPR1. They showed similar expression patterns among the organs, studied in this investigation. GmNPR1-1 and GmNPR1-2 are the only soybean homologues of NPR1and are located in homoeologous regions. In GmNPR1-1 and GmNPR1-2 transformed Arabidopsis npr1-1 mutant plants, SAR markers: (i) PR-1 was induced following INA treatment and (ii) BGL2 following infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst), and SAR was induced following Pst infection. Of the five cysteine residues, Cys82, Cys150, Cys155, Cys160, and Cys216 involved in oligomer-monomer transition in NPR1, Cys216 in GmNPR1-1 and GmNPR1-2 proteins was substituted to Ser and Leu, respectively..
PMC3505149	Results. . CAN nucleases are predicted to be N-myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins with modified SNase domains. A BLAST search of the NCBI protein database revealed that in plants two classes of proteins possess domains homologous to active sites of staphylococcal nucleases. One of them comprises two genes, AT5G61780 and AT5G07350, containing four tandem repeats of staphylococcal nuclease-like domains followed by a tudor and C-terminal SNc domain. The second class comprises two genes, At3g56170 and At2g40410, encoding proteins designated in this paper as CAN1 and CAN2, respectively. In contrast to Tudor motive containing proteins, the CAN1 and CAN2 possess single SNase domains. Detailed analyses of both CAN amino acid sequences revealed that these proteins exhibit complex primary structures consisting of various motifs conserved throughout the different classes of proteins.. One of the most intriguing features of both CAN proteins is the unique structure of their catalytic domains located near their carboxyl terminal ends. This domain contains all conserved amino acid residues considered to be functionally critical for the enzymatic activity of the staphylococcal nuclease (Figure. 1). However, our analysis revealed that this domain is divided by a short sequence, including ca. 55 amino acids, that does not exhibit any homology to known SNase domains. This insertion separates a highly conserved N-end part of SNc domain (N-SNc), containing one of the Ca2+ binding aspartate residues, from the C-end part of this domain (C-SNc), containing a second Ca2+ binding aspartate and three amino acid residues putatively directly involved in enzyme catalysis, i.e. two arginines and one glutamate (Figure. 1). Both parts of CAN1 and CAN2 SNc domains show a most significant similarity to the catalytic domain of bacterial parB nuclease; however, their similarity to well defined staphylococcal nucleases. [19] is also significant. The sequence analysis of the amino acid fragment that divides two parts of SNc domain, unexpectedly revealed that this region shares homology with some bacterial cysteinyl-tRNA synthetases (Figure. 1). What we find particularly interesting is that this CAN nucleases motive almost exactly corresponds to the tRNA synthetases domain responsible for the recognition of the tRNA anticodon loop. [24]. Furthermore, the five out of the six residues which in tRNA synthetases either directly interact with anticodon nucleotides or are critical for the stability of the binding cavity are strictly or highly conserved in CAN proteins. It should be noted that this insertion is conserved among all plant CAN homologues including those from evolutionarily ancient plants like Physcomitrella and Selaginella (data not shown).. . Figure 1. . Domain organization and sequence alignments of Arabidopsis CAN1 and CAN2 proteins. The amino acid sequence alignment of two Arabidopsis CAN nucleases with conserved motifs of five bacterial proteins. The alignment contains the full-length sequences of CAN1 and CAN2 proteins and parts of the bacterial proteins showing the highest similarity to the corresponding regions of the CAN1 and CAN2 sequences (brackets above and below the sequences).

Black dots () - residues involved in binding of Ca2+ ions. Open dots () - residues within the active site of the SNase domain. N-SNc and C-SNc - N-terminal and C-terminal parts of a putative SNase catalytic domain, respectively.. . . . We also examined a potential post-translational modification of CAN nucleases. Using the Myristoylator program we identified the N-terminal myristoylation consensus motifs in both Arabidopsis CAN nucleases. The glycine residue at position 2, which in myristoylated proteins serves as an acceptor site for myristate. [25], is also present in all other plant CAN homologues. Both CAN nucleases have been classified by Boisson et al.[26] to the list of 437 putatively myristoylated Arabidopsis proteins (N-myristoylome), determined on the basis of combined experimental and bioinformatic approaches. Myristoylation can influence the ability of a protein to interact with membrane, but the presence of myristoyl moiety is not sufficient for stable membrane attachment. It is believed that protein membrane anchorage, induced by myristoylation, is followed by palmitoylation of cysteine residue(s). [25]. Application of CSS-Palm software, designed for palmitoylation prediction. [27], showed the presence of a putative palmitoylation site directly downstream of the myristoylation motive in CAN1 and CAN2 (Figure. 1). Since such an arrangement of myristoylation and palmitoylation sites at the N terminus has been identified in a number of membrane proteins this suggests that this region of CAN proteins may also be involved in membrane attachment.. The CAN protein region, located between N-terminal myristoylation/palmitoylation motifs and the SNc catalytic domain does not exhibit similarities to any defined domain, neither does it reveal significant homology to any other plant or animal protein sequences. However, a BLAST search of this amino acid sequence within the protein databases showed its highest homology to some periplasmic components of bacterial ABC-type transporters. [28]. Although the low sequence similarity existing between CAN nucleases and ABC transporters does not allow any definite conclusions to be drawn about their potentially analogous functions, it might indicate their putative phylogenetic relationships.. . . CAN1 and CAN2 nucleases transiently expressed in protoplasts vary in their catalytic activities. The nucleotide sequences deposited in public databases have been used to design PCR primers for amplification of full length cDNAs encoding both Arabidopsis staphylococcal-like nucleases. The microarray data, discussed later in this article, suggest that CAN1 expression can be induced by developmental and stress cues, including age dependent senescence, and that the activity of the CAN2 gene is essentially constitutive. Consequently, we used reverse transcribed mRNA purified from early senescent leaves as a template for PCR amplification of both genes. The RT-PCR amplified products were cloned into plant expression vectors, which allowed us to obtain transient expression of recombinant native as well as C-terminal HA- and fluorescent protein-tagged fusion proteins.. The published report concerning plant staphylococcal-like nucleases demonstrated the Ca2+-dependent activity of bacterially expressed proteins. [21,22]. However, since the activity of plant enzymes may be affected by various post-translation modifications, we decided to examine both members of this family after transient over-expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. In our study we transformed the protoplasts prepared from root cell cultures and from leaf mesophile and obtained similar results.. To estimate the efficiency of protein synthesis, the protein extracts from transformed protoplasts were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody against the HA-domain tagged at the C-terminus of the transgenes. As shown in Figure. 2A, both transgenes were efficiently expressed in protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis suspension cells. The molecular mass of the recombinant CAN1 and CAN2 proteins, estimated using Western blot analysis, was approximately 36 kDa and 39 kDa, roughly the same as predicted from the deduced amino acid sequences: 36.1 kDa and 37.3 kDa, respectively.. . Figure 2. . Detection of transiently expressed CAN1 and CAN2 nuclease activity. The protein extract from protoplasts transformed with empty vectors (pSAT6A-ECFP-N1) was used as a negative control (contr.).

The abbreviations of the mutated domains as above (Figure. 2F). (H) Detection of the nuclease activity of CAN2 mutants. The abbreviations of mutated domains as above (Figure. 2F).. . . . To identify the DNase activity of CAN proteins over-expressed in protoplasts, we used an in-gel nuclease activity assay. Application of this assay in combination with single stranded DNA used as a substrate and in the presence of calcium ions allowed us to detect clear bands representing nucleolytic activity at the position corresponding to the molecular mass of CAN1 and CAN2 (Figure. 2B). All repeated experiments revealed that, despite the comparable efficiency of expression of both nucleases, the yield of nuclease activity was significantly higher for CAN2. Analogous experiments performed with undenatured DNA demonstrated that both nucleases also digest double stranded DNA, but in this case the activity of both nucleases is comparable. An adjustment of the reaction conditions allowed us to estimate that the maximum activity of both proteins was at pH 8.0 and a Ca2+ concentration of about 5 mM with a range of 1 to 10 mM (data not shown). Moreover, we found that in the presence of EDTA both nucleases did not reveal any activity. A pronounced inhibition effect was also observed with Zn2+. Moreover, we found that heat denaturation in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol prior to electrophoresis does not inhibit the activities of either enzyme, suggesting a lack of the functionally important disulphide bonds in their native structure. In gel RNase assay, conducted with plant total RNA as a substrate (Figure. 2C) revealed that both nucleases also have ability to degrade RNA which demonstrate that they can be defined as the sugar-nonspecific nucleases. Such a diverse substrate specificity suggests that the function of CAN nucleases is associated with degradative processes.. In the present studies we also used CAN recombinant nucleases fused with ECFP, GFP and RFP. Since the stability of recombinant proteins with a C-end or N-end attached fluorescent marker protein can be altered post-translationally by proteolytic processing we also analyzed them via western blot and in-gel nuclease activity assay. As shown in Figure. 2D and E, the electrophoretic mobilities of both nucleases with C-tagged ECFP were retarded as compared with co-electrophoresed untagged proteins, corresponding to their enhanced molecular weight. Furthermore, the nuclease activity of CAN2-ECFP seems to be unaltered in comparison to untagged CAN2 and is significantly stronger than CAN1-ECFP.. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that plant CAN nucleases, in addition to SNc domains, also contain some conserved domains of unknown function. In order to understand their relevance for nucleolytic activity, the CAN2 deletion mutants were constructed to remove regions, comprising conserved residues of each domain (Figure. 2F). Because we intended to use these constructs to study CAN2 nucleolytic activity as well as its cellular location, deletion mutants of untagged CAN2 and CFP-tagged CAN2 were prepared. Despite the identical condition of transformation in all repeated experiments we observed a decreased amount of CAN2 mutant with the deleted myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs, which suggests that this region can be involved in protein stability (Figure. 2G). The analysis of the nuclease activity of untagged and CFP-fused CAN2 revealed that mutants lacking the N-SNc, C-SNc domains and ABC protein-like motifs, are completely inactive (Figure. 2H). Instead, deletion of the amino acid sequence showing a similarity to the anti-codon binding domain decreases but does not eliminate CAN2 DNase activity. This is particularly interesting, given the fact that this region is located inside the catalytic domain, but apparently is not crucial for CAN1/2 DNase and RNase activities (Figure. 2C).. . . The expression of CAN1 nuclease is induced during xylogenesis and leaf senescence and correlates with host-pathogen interactions, whereas the expression of CAN2 is generally constitutive. In order to establish gene expression profiles for both CAN nucleases we analyzed microarray experiments reported by Genevestigator. [29]. This Database has collected results of 419 microarray experiments (7137 samples) performed by authors exploring various aspects of Arabidopsis biology. Since in many cases the same determinant of gene expression was analyzed independently by several research groups, in our opinion their results provide an opportunity to obtain verifiable and objective information about the expression patterns of selected genes.. We began our studies by examining CAN1 [TAIR:At3g56170] and CAN2 [TAIR:At2g40410] genes expression during different developmental processes. In principle all microarray experiments conducted to compare the Arabidopsis tissue specific transcription profiles clearly indicate that CAN1 nuclease is preferentially expressed in stems and roots (Figure. 3A-C, Additional file. 1). On the other hand, low expression of CAN1 mRNA was observed in seeds, seedling, young leaves and flowers. In contrast to CAN1, the organ specific variability of CAN2 expression was relatively small. The analysis of other microarrays revealed that transcription of CAN1 is low in the upper part of the stem but significantly increased in the lower part (Figure. 3D, E). Since these parts of the stem differ mainly in the degree of xylem development, this suggests that CAN1 nuclease can be involved in this process. This assumption has been confirmed by experiments conducted to identify the genes involved in development of different parts of the vascular bundle, i.e. xylem, phloem, cortex, (Figure. 3F), as well as genes activated in cells induced to transdifferentiate into xylem tracheary elements (Figure. 3G).. .

The abbreviations (low/high N) and (gluc +/-) indicate the nitrogen and glucose concentration, respectively, in the culture medium. Expression profiles of senescence-associated BFN1 nuclease are also shown.. . . . The level of CAN1 expression in young and mature leaves is low but it increases with leaf aging. This effect was observed in developmental leaf senescence (Figure. 3H) as well as in leaves that have been induced to senesce by nitrogen deficiency (Figure. 3I). Figure. 3H-I shows that the expression pattern of CAN1 nuclease in senescent leaves is analogous to the AT1G11190 gene encoding the well defined BFN1 nuclease involved in leaf senescence. [5,6]. Both genes, AT1G11190 (BFN1) and At3g56170 (CAN1), have also been included in the list of about 800 genes showing at least a 3 fold up regulation during leaf senescence, identified by Buchanan-Wollaston et al.[30].. Numerous microarray studies have demonstrated upregulation of CAN1 expression during environmental stresses. Similar to developmental processes, external stimuli significantly modulate expression of CAN1 (At3g56170) but weakly affect expression of CAN2 gene (At2g40410). We observed that among all the tested factors those that are related with pathogenesis have the strongest influence on CAN1 expression. The analysis of the experiments presented in Figure. 4A-D and Additional file. 2 clearly indicates that upregulation of this gene is stimulated by some bacteria and viruses, while fungi, nematodes and insects do not exert such an effect. Among the ten experiments conducted to study various aspects of Pseudomonas sp. infection, nine revealed an elevated level of CAN1 mRNA in relation to controls in tissues attacked by this pathogen (Figure. 4A-C, Additional file. 2). The transcription of the CAN1 gene was also stimulated by E.coli (Additional file. 2, AT-00202) and dsDNA virus, CaLCuV (Figure. 4D). Other experiments have shown that activation of CAN1 does not depend on the virulence of the Pseudomonas strain (vir/avir) (Figure. 4E) and also occurs after elicitor treatment. Three of four available experiments investigating the influence of flagellin on gene expression have shown that this elicitor can activate CAN1 transcription (Figure. 4F, Additional file. 2). The particularly strong upregulation of the CAN1 gene was observed in two experiments studying the influence of syringolin A, the virulence factor secreted by P.syringae (Figure. 4G, Additional file. 2).. .

To verify the data obtained from the microarray experiments we examined whether suggested mRNA expression profiles of CAN1 and CAN2 genes correspond to any endogenous nucleolytic activity. We analyzed nuclease activity profiles of developing stem and senescing leaves. The development of xylem begins in the lower part of the stem and this zone successively moves towards the upper part of the growing stem. According to the scheme presented by Brown et al.[31] we analyzed the protein extracts isolated from different parts of stems obtained from plants aged from 4 to 8 weeks. As shown in Figure. 5A, in-gel nuclease activity assay revealed that the samples prepared from stems contain two nucleases migrating to the same position as over-expressed CAN1 and CAN2 used as a control. The activity of endogenous nucleases corresponding to CAN2 was essentially constant, which agrees with the observation derived from the microarray data. In contrast, the activity of the endogenous nuclease migrating in an identical fashion as CAN1 is much more variable, i.e. it is invisible or weak in the upper part of stems and increases towards the stem base.. . Figure 5. . Endogenous CAN1 and CAN2 activity. (A) Changes in endogenous CAN1 and CAN2 activity during stem development. DNase activity of protein extracts from the 4-8 week old stems were analyzed. The abbreviations for the gel tracks refer to the part of stem: (T) - stem tip, (Tm) - upper middle part of stem, (Bm) - lower middle part of stem, (B) - stem base. CAN1 (C1) and CAN2 (C1) nucleases transiently expressed in protoplasts were used as positive controls. (B-C) The endogenous CAN1 and CAN2 nuclease activity of individual leaves of 7 week old (B) and 8 week old (C) rosettes. Consecutive leaf extracts are arranged from the youngest (1) to oldest (10) leaf of rosettes. The CAN1 (C1) and CAN2 (C1) controls as above (Figure. 5A).. . . . To identify the nucleases associated with senescence we analyzed protein extracts obtained from the individual rosette leaves of 7 and 8 week old plants. As presented in Figure. 5B and C, endogenous nuclease activity corresponding to CAN1 appears for the first time in older leaves of a 7 week old rosette and becomes more common in the 8 week old rosette leaves. Thus, this result supports the role of CAN1 nuclease in age-dependent development. The activity profile of CAN2 nuclease identified in 7 and 8 week old leaves as well as in the leaves of younger plants (data not shown) was much more constant, which supports the hypothesis that this nuclease is characterized by a constitutive expression.. The assumption that observed endogenous nuclease activities refer to CAN1 and CAN2 proteins stems from the facts that corresponding proteins possess exactly the same electrophoretic mobility, catalytic requirements, and unusual resistance to heat denaturation, detergents and 2-mercaptoethanol. Resistance to a reducing agent provides an opportunity to distinguish endogenous plant staphylococcal-like nucleases from plant S1 type nucleases, which possess disulphide bonds and in our experience are inhibited by 2-mercapthoethanol (data not shown). This allows us to conclude that microarray mRNA expression data, confirmed by our protein activity assays, together suggest that expression of CAN1 nuclease is associated with different forms of PCD, such as xylem development or senescence, while CAN2 expression is generally constitutive.. . . The CAN1 and CAN2 nucleases are anchored to the plasma membrane, probably via N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation. In order to determine the cellular distribution of CAN nucleases, the translational fusion constructs, CAN1-ECFP and CAN2-ECFP, were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis root protoplasts. As a negative control, an empty vector plasmid, pSAT4A-ECFP (expressing ECFP alone), was used. As demonstrated in Figure. 6A, ECFP alone, used as a control, is typically distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. In turn, intensive and sharp fluorescent rings were visible around the protoplasts with over-expressed CAN1 and CAN2 nucleases fused to ECFP (Figure. 6B, C). The same subcellular location of both proteins we observed in transformed leaf protoplasts (Additional file. 3). Protoplasts transfected with the same constructs but analyzed via fluorescence microscopy displayed uniform fluorescence of the protoplast surfaces (Additional file. 4). These fluorescence images suggest that both nucleases are associated with plasma membrane. To ensure that this unusual location of proteins possessing nuclease activity is not the artificial result of the protoplast preparation procedure we also analyzed the location of both nucleases in plant cells transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. As shown in Figure. 7A and D, the fluorescence of CAN1-RFP and CAN2-GFP fusion proteins appeared as sharp lines along the edges of transformed epidermal cells. Magnifications of selected areas showed that the fluorescence signal forms two parallel lines indicating plasma membranes of two neighboring cells (Figure. 7B, C). Moreover, as presented in Figure. 7E, drought induced plasmolysis caused displacement of the fluorescence signal towards the cell center, which further proves the association of CAN nucleases with the plasma membrane.. . Figure 6. . Plasma membrane localization of CAN1 and CAN2 nucleases in protoplasts. ECFP alone and ECFP-fusion proteins were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis root cell protoplasts. Localization was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (right half of each panel). The corresponding bright-field images are shown on the left halves of panels.

Strong signal around the nucleus (n) and numerous cytoplasmic strands show characteristic cytoplasmatic localization of GFP protein. The length of the white scale bar at the right bottom of each panel corresponds to 10 mum.. . . . The bioinformatic analysis of CAN nucleases amino acid sequences did not reveal any pronounced hydrophobic regions that could represent transmembrane domains. To identify the segments potentially interacting with the plasma membrane we applied deletion mutants of the CAN2 nuclease (Figure. 2F) for transfection experiments. As shown in Figure. 8B-E, the deletion mutations created in the ABC-like domain, the anticodon binding-like domain and both fragments of SNc domains did not affect the plasma membrane localization of CAN2. Insted, deletion of the N-end fragment containing the myristoylation/palmitylation motifs significantly affected subcellular localization of this nuclease (Figure. 8A). The removal of the myristoylation/palmitylation motifs from the CAN1 nuclease resulted in the same effect (Figure. 8F). Since it is known that N-terminus myristoylation is required for membrane targeting and that palmitoylation of proximal cysteine residue greatly stabilizes membrane association, we concluded that CAN nucleases are most probably anchored to the plasma membrane via these posttranslational modifications.. . Figure 8. . Subcellular localization of CAN nucleases deletion mutants. ECFP-fusion proteins were transiently expressed in  Arabidopsis  root cell protoplasts. The bright-field images are shown in the left part of each panel and corresponding confocal laser scanning images are on the right. The images show the cellular location of the ECFP fused proteins lacking the following consensus sequences: (A) CAN2 mutant lacking N-myristoylation and palmitoylation consensus sequences. (B) CAN2 mutant lacking the ABC transporter-like sequence. (C) CAN2 mutant lacking the N-SNc domain. (D) CAN2 mutant lacking the anticodon binding-like sequence (E) CAN2 mutant lacking the C-SNc domain. (F) CAN1 mutant lacking N-myristoylation and palmitoylation consensus sequences. The abbreviations of mutated domains as in Figure. 2F The length of the white scale bar at the right bottom of each panel corresponds to 10 mum.. . . . We took into account that CAN nucleases could change their location in response to various cellular and exogenous factors related to PCD. To verify such a possibility the protoplasts containing over-expressed CAN1-ECFP and CAN2-ECFP were then subjected to treatment with the following factors, in the ranges given in brackets: H2O2 (0.1-1mM), heat stress (36-55C), salt stress (NaCl 0.1-1M), flg22 peptide (0.1-1mM), E. coli strain DH5alpha (OD 0.01) and A.tumefaciens strain GV3101 (OD 0.01). Moreover, we compared the cellular location of CAN nucleases over-expressed in protoplast prepared from the cells of young (6 week old), mature (8 week old) and early senescent (12 week old) rosette leaves. However, we did not observe any influence of the above treatment on CAN subcellular location (data not shown). Moreover, we did not detect over-expressed proteins in the protoplast medium which suggests that under the tested conditions they are not secreted from the cell (data not shown). These results show that CAN nucleases probably do not change their cellular localization under stress conditions that could trigger PCD or plant defense response..
PMC5384131	Results. To characterize the regulatory processes governing ALS activity we utilized several complementary approaches. Using the ALS catalytic protein subunit as bait we performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen which resulted in the identification of a set of interacting proteins, two of which (denoted as ALS-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 and 3 [AIP1 and AIP3, respectively]) were found to be evolutionarily conserved orthologues of bacterial feedback-regulatory proteins and therefore implicated in the regulation of ALS activity. To investigate the molecular role AIPs might play in BCAA synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, we examined the functional contribution of aip1 and aip3 knockout alleles to plant patterning and development and BCAA synthesis under various growth conditions. Loss-of-function genetic backgrounds involving these two genes exhibited differential aberrant growth responses in valine-, isoleucine-, and sodium chloride-supplemented media. While BCAA synthesis is believed to be localized to the chloroplast, both AIP1 and AIP3 were found to localize to the peroxisome in addition to the chloroplast. Analysis of free amino acid pools in the mutant backgrounds revealed that they differ in the absolute amount of individual BCAAs accumulated and exhibit elevated levels of BCAAs in leaf tissues. Despite the phenotypic differences observed in aip1 and aip3 backgrounds, functional redundancy between these loci was suggested by the finding that aip1/aip3 double knockout mutants are severely developmentally compromised..
PMC3612061	Results. . The papp5 mutation reverts the pale crd phenotype in papp5crd double mutant. We used a T-DNA insertion mutant (crd) of the CHL27/CRD gene encoding a potential subunit of the cyclase enzyme complex involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis downstream of Mg-ProtoIX [28], [35]. The crd mutant has a pale phenotype and reduced growth (Figure 1A-B, Figure S2) [28], [35], [36]. The strong reduction in chlorophyll b content compared to chlorophyll a results in a higher chlorophyll a/b ratio in crd compared to wild type (Figure 1B). The T-DNA insertion line for PAPP5, papp5 demonstrated wild type phenotype under our growth conditions. In the papp5crd double mutant the pale phenotype observed in the crd single mutant is lost and the chlorophyll content is recovered to wild type levels (Figure 1A-B) together with the recovery of the morphology and the flowering time (Figure S3).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0060305.g001. Figure 1. . The papp5 mutation rescues the crd phenotype.. Plants were grown on soil under short day (SD) conditions (9 hours light/15 hours darkness) to characterize wild type, crd, papp5 and papp5crd. A) Representative images from 6-week-old plants. Scale bars represent 1 cm. B) Chlorophyll a and b content and chlorophyll a/b ratio in 6-week-old plants. Significant differences relative to Col0 (crd) and to crd (papp5crd) according to t-test (a, P<0.001; b, P<0.005; c, P<0,01) are shown. C) Representative electron microscopy images of chloroplasts from Col0, crd, papp5 and papp5crd from 6-week-old plants grown under SD conditions. Scale bar is 1 m. D) Blue native PAGE profile of thylakoid membrane protein complexes isolated from Col0, papp5, crd and papp5crd plants. Each well was loaded with the 35 g protein.. . . . In addition to the pale phenotype, the chloroplast structure in the crd mutant is different compared to wild type and papp5. The crd chloroplasts are poorly developed containing only stroma-exposed thylakoids and abnormal grana thylakoids (Figure 1C) [28]. Coinciding with the defect in chloroplast structure is the difference in the arrangements of the photosynthetic complexes in the crd mutant compared to wild type and the papp5 mutant (Figure 1D). Similarly to what was observed for chlorophyll content (Figure 1A-B), the papp5crd double mutant reverts the chloroplast phenotype observed in the crd single mutant (Figure 1C-D). Thus, in contrast to the crd single mutant the papp5crd double mutant displays normal growth and chlorophyll content, fully developed chloroplast with proper thylakoid membranes and correctly assembled photosynthetic complexes (Figure 1A-D).. We hypothesized that the obtained phenotype in the papp5crd double mutant could be linked to a defective PHYA/PHYB signalling pathway. However, the phyBcrd double mutant maintained the pale phenotype of crd compared to wild type (Figure S2A-B). These results suggest that impairment in the phyB mediated light-signalling pathway is not involved in the restoration of papp5crd double mutant phenotype. We also tested the possibility that introducing the papp5 mutation would revert the phenotype of any pale mutant unrelated to the accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX by generating the papp5gun5 double mutant. The gun5 mutant has a pale phenotype but it does not accumulate Mg-ProtoIX. This pale phenotype was maintained also in the papp5gun5 double mutant (Figure S2C).. . . The papp5crd double mutant demonstrates normal chloroplast development. Depletion of PAPP5 restored the crd mutant phenotype in mature plants. To investigate if PAPP5 plays a role during chloroplast development and seedling establishment we analyzed the chloroplast morphology at different time points during the first 24 hours of seedling development in the light. In the dark grown samples, we observed no differences in either the prolamelar bodies (PLB) or the plastid structures between wild type and any of the mutants (Figure 2A-D). In wild type the first signs of chloroplast development was detected after 4 hours of illumination when the PLBs start to disappear and the first thylakoid membranes were formed (Figure 2E). A similar development of the chloroplasts was observed in the papp5 mutant but in papp5 it was also possible to detect formation of grana membranes already after 4 hours of light exposure (Figure 2F). In contrast, chloroplast development is significantly delayed in crd (Figure 2G). However, in the papp5crd double mutant the chloroplasts develop normally (Figure 2H). After 12 hours of illumination, the chloroplasts in wild type, papp5 and papp5crd are already fully developed and the basic internal thylakoid membranes and grana stacks are formed. The chloroplasts in crd display less evolved thylakoid membranes that lack grana structures (Figure 2I-L). The same observation was made after 24 hours of illumination where the crd seedlings showed minimal thylakoid membrane structures without grana complexes (Figure 2O). However, this feature was restored in the papp5crd double mutant. These studies confirm that the changes that restore the crd phenotype in papp5crd start during the de-etiolation process.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0060305.g002. Figure 2. . Chloroplast development during de-etiolation.. Sequential electron microscopy images from Col0 (A, E, I and M), papp5 (B, F, J and N), crd (C, G, K and O) and papp5crd (D, H, L and P) during the first 24 hours of illumination (100 mol photons m-2 sec-1). Samples were collected 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h following transfer to light and compared to the dark sample. Arrows indicate examples of grana structures. Scale bar=1 m.. . . . Similar changes were observed when we analyzed the chlorophyll content in the different genotypes during the first hours of seedlings development upon illumination. The crd accumulated significantly less chlorophyll compared to wild type following both 12 and 24 hours illumination (Figure 3A-B). In addition, the chlorophyll a/b ratio was elevated in the crd seedlings similarly to what was observed in the mature plants (Figure 3C and 1B). However, papp5crd double mutant demonstrated similar chlorophyll a and b levels and chlorophyll a/b ratio to wild type (Figure 3A-C). Interestingly, the papp5 mutant demonstrated higher levels of chlorophyll following both 12 and 24 hours illumination suggesting that PAPP5 acts as a negative regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis during the early light response (Figure 3A-B).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0060305.g003. Figure 3. . Chlorophyll determination during de-etiolation.. Chlorophyll content in Col0, papp5, crd and papp5crd seedlings following A) 12 h and B) 24 h of illumination. C) Chlorophyll a/b ratio in the different lines during 12 h and 24 h of illumination. Significant differences relative to Col0 (crd) and to crd (papp5crd) according to t-test (a, P<0.001; b, P<0.005; c, P<0.01; d, P<0.05) are shown.. . . . . . Normal induction of PhANG expression in response to light is obtained in the papp5crd double mutant. The different physiological features observed in papp5crd compared to the crd single mutant encouraged us to investigate expression of genes encoding components essential for chloroplast development. We analysed expression of the PhANGs, LHCB2.4, GLK1 and GLK2 during the first 12 and 24 hours of illumination. LHCB2.4 is a nuclear gene encoding a chloroplast LHCII antenna apoprotein that is expressed during the light-induced chloroplast development. As expected, LHCB2.4 expression increased following exposure to light compared to the dark samples in wild type (Figure 4A). In papp5, the LHCB2.4 transcript levels increased more strongly following 12 and 24 hours light exposure compared to wild type. Also when expression levels were compared to wild type at each time point PhANG expression was higher in the papp5 mutant (Figure S4). This coincides with the increased accumulation of chlorophyll that was also observed in the papp5 mutant compared to wild type (Figure 3). In contrast, the crd mutant demonstrated impaired induction of LHCB2.4 expression compared to wild type and papp5. However, the papp5 mutation restores the suppressed PhANG expression in crd and the papp5crd double mutant showed significantly stronger induction of LHCB2.4 expression compared to the crd single mutant (Figure 4A). The expression data was supported by the LHCB2.4 protein levels in the different genotypes as demonstrated by Western blot (Figure 4A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0060305.g004. Figure 4. . PhANG expression during chloroplast development.. Relative expression levels of A) LHCB2.4 (At3g27690) complemented with Western blot analysis of LHCBII protein and beta-Tubulin as protein loading control, B) GLK1 (At2g20570) and C) GLK2 (At5g44190) in seedlings grown for three days in dark and exposed to 12 h and 24 h of illumination. Expression levels were compared to the respective dark control for each genotype and relative expression was calculated using Ubiquitin-protein ligase (At4g36800) as a reference gene. Data represents the mean ( SD) from three independent biological replicates. Significant differences relative to Col0 (crd and papp5) and to crd (papp5crd) were calculated according to t-test (a, P0.001; b, P0.005; c, P0.01). The bands were quantified using ImageJ software and the relative band intensities were obtained and related to Col0 12 h samples.. . . . The GLK1 and GLK2 are transcription factors required for chlorophyll biosynthesis and PhANG expression during chloroplast development [25], [37]. Similarly to the expression of LHCB2.4, expression of GLK1/2 is induced by exposure to light in wild type (Figure 4B-C). Again, a stronger induction of GLK1 and GLK2 expression in response to light was observed in papp5 compared to wild type whereas in crd expression of GLK1 did not change significantly during the first 24 hours of light compared to the dark sample. Also the induction of GLK2 expression was significantly suppressed in crd compared to what was observed in wild type (Figure 4B-C). The suppressed PhANG expression in crd coincides with the observed arrest of chloroplast development in the mutant (Figure 2). Finally, the papp5crd seedlings displayed GLK1 and GLK2 expression similar to wild type (Figure 4B-C). Also when expression levels were compared to crd at each time point PhANG expression was restored in the papp5crd double mutant (Figure S4). In summary, restored induction of LHCB2.4, GLK1 and GLK2 expression could explain the wild type chloroplast morphology in papp5crd during the early light response.. . . Significant tetrapyrrole accumulation observed also in papp5crd. Due to impaired Mg-ProtoIX-ME cyclase activity in the crd mutant, the crd plants accumulate large pools of tetrapyrrole intermediates and the accumulation has been shown to correlate with a negative effect on the PhANG expression [28]. The accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX and its methyl ester, Mg-ProtoIX-ME was determined in the different genotypes during the first 24 hours of illumination. In wild type, Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME accumulated slightly in the light samples compared to the dark (Figure 5A). In papp5, the accumulation of tetrapyrroles was slightly higher compared to wild type which also fits with the faster accumulation of chlorophyll in response to light in papp5 (Figure 3). However, in crd and papp5crd a massive accumulation Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME was observed (Figure 5A). Although the accumulation of tetrapyrroles was lower in papp5crd compared to crd, the papp5 mutation does not rescue the cyclase activity or restores the amount of CRD protein (Figure 5A).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0060305.g005. Figure 5. . Tetrapyrrole accumulation maintained in papp5crd.. A) Relative fluorescence corresponding to Mg-ProtoIX and Mg-ProtoIX-ME in seedlings from Col0, papp5, crd, and papp5crd during the dark to light transition. 3-d-old seedlings were transferred to constant light (100 mol photons light cm-2 sec-1) and samples were collected following 12 h and 24 h exposure. Each data point represents the mean ( SD) of four independent biological replicates. Fluorescence data is complemented with Western blot analysis of the CRD protein levels in the different genotypes. beta-Tubulin was used as protein loading control. B) Relative expression of APX2 (At3g09640) in Col0, papp5, crd, and papp5crd. Expression levels were compared to the respective dark control for each genotype and relative expression was calculated using Ubiquitin-protein ligase (At4g36800) as a reference gene. Each bar represents the mean ( SD) of at least three independent biological samples. Significant differences relative to Col0 (crd and papp5) and to crd (papp5crd) were calculated according to t-test (a, P<0.001; b, c, P<0.01). . . . Tetrapyrroles are photoreactive molecules and in response to light, ROS could be generated [38]. Induction ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 2 (APX2) expression is one of the most commonly used markers for the H2O2 response and expression of APX2 was therefore investigated in the different genotypes following exposure to light for 12 and 24 hours. In wild type and papp5, APX2 expression was slightly induced following 12 hours light exposure but following 24 hours illumination the expression levels dropped to control levels (Figure 5B). After 12 hours light exposure the chloroplasts are still immature (Figure 2) and most likely not able to completely quench the light. However, after 24 hours in the light the chloroplasts appear mature and the different photosynthetic complexes are able to efficiently absorb the light and as a consequence less ROS is produced (Figure 5B). The crd seedlings displayed much stronger induction of APX2 expression compared to wild type and papp5. Furthermore, the APX2 expression level did not drop following 24 hours illumination in the crd mutant. This coincides with the undeveloped chloroplasts observed in the crd mutant at this time point (Figure 2). In contrast to the crd single mutant, the papp5crd double mutant did not show elevated APX2 expression (Figure 5B). This is despite the fact that the papp5crd double mutant maintains very high pools of accumulated tetrapyrroles (Figure 5A). Thus, the ROS mediated signal triggering APX2 induction is not correlated with the accumulated pools of tetrapyrroles but rather to the developmental stage of the chloroplasts.. . . PAPP5 is a component of a cytosolic protein complex that binds Mg-ProtoIX. In contrast to the crd single mutant, papp5crd demonstrated wild type expression of PhANGs and normal development of chloroplast in response to light (Figure 2-4) despite significant accumulation of the chlorophyll intermediates Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME. Thus, the results suggest that PAPP5 is involved in the perception and/or the mediation of the tetrapyrrole triggered retrograde signal. To determine if there is a direct interaction between PAPP5 and Mg-ProtoIX, recombinant full-length PAPP5 and TPR-PAPP5, lacking the TPR domain, was expressed and Mg-ProtoIX bound by the proteins was quantified by spectrofluorometry (Figure S5A). Using this method, no direct interaction between Mg-ProtoIX and PAPP5 could be detected. However, we also tested in vivo if PAPP5 is a component of a distinct protein complex that is able to bind Mg-ProtoIX. We transiently expressed PAPP5 fused to a cMyc-tag in tobacco plants, immunoprecipitated PAPP5 containing protein complexes and incubated the isolated complexes with Mg-ProtoIX as it was done for the recombinant proteins (Figure S5A). The experimental procedure used in this assay requires elution of the protein complex with acidic buffer in order to break the Immunoglobulin-to-antigen binding. Under these acidic conditions, the Mg-ProtoIX molecule is unstable and the Mg2+ ion is released from the tetrapyrrole ring (Figure S5B) and as a consequence we detected ProtoIX instead of Mg-ProtoIX. It is clear from this in vivo approach that protein(s) immunoprecipitated with PAPP5 can bind Mg-ProtoIX (Figure 6). Possibly another protein partner(s) is required for PAPP5 to be able to bind the tetrapyrrole or PAPP5 is associated with another tetrapyrrole binding protein in a complex.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0060305.g006. Figure 6. . In planta tetrapyrrole binding assay.. Tetrapyrrole fluorescence spectra from CoIP assay using pGWB16-empty (control) and 35-PAPP5-cMyc (pGWB16) transformed tobacco plants. The native PAPP5 protein complex was immunoprecipitated from PAPP5 overexpressing tobacco plants with anti c-myc antibody and incubated with Mg-ProtoIX solution. The amount of tetrapyrrole bound to the protein complex was estimated by fluorescence. The excitation wavelength used was 416 nm. The Western blot of the samples is shown in the upper panel using the anti-myc antibody.. . . . . . PAPP5 responds to the tetrapyrrole mediated plastid signal and acts as a negative regulator of PhANG expression. In order to test the link between PAPP5 and the tetrapyrrole-mediated retrograde signalling pathway we analysed PhANG expression in wild type and papp5 following feeding with Mg-ProtoIX or 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). ALA is the first metabolite in the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway that leads to chlorophyll. Mg-ProtoIX feeding results in increased tetrapyrrole levels in the cytosol whereas ALA treatment increases tetrapyrrole content in the chloroplast which better represents a biological situation when flux through the tetrapyrrole pathway is altered. Mg-ProtoIX (Figure 7A) and ALA (Figure 7B) feeding resulted in a significant accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX both in wild type and papp5 compared to the mock samples. Following the Mg-ProtoIX and ALA feeding expression of LHCB2.4, GLK1 and GLK2 was repressed in wild type (Figure 7C-D). This is in agreement with several published reports on the negative effects of tetrapyrroles on PhANG expression [15], [16], [17], [18], [28]. However, in the papp5 mutant, LHCB2.4, GLK1 and GLK2 expression was insensitive to Mg-ProtoIX feeding and no repression in expression levels could be detected (Figure 7C). Following ALA feeding repression of GLK1 and GLK2 was observed in the papp5 mutant but the repression was significantly less compared to wild type (Figure 7D). Thus, these results suggest that PAPP5 is required to respond correctly to accumulation of tetrapyrroles in the cell.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0060305.g007. Figure 7. . The papp5 mutant is insensitive to tetrapyrrole feeding.. Feeding experiments were performed to increase the levels of tetrapyrroles in the plants. During the dark period, two-week-old plants from Col0 and papp5 grown under LD conditions (15 hours light/9 hours dark) were treated with A) 50 M Mg-ProtoIX or B) 10 mM ALA. Relative fluorescence corresponding to Mg-ProtoIX and Mg-ProtoIX-ME is shown. Samples were collected 4 h and 1 h into the light period following the Mg-ProtoIX and ALA treatment, respectively. Each bar represents the mean ( SD) of three independent biological replicates. Relative expression of LHCB2.4 (At3g27690), GLK1 (At2g20570) and GLK2 (At5g44190) in Col0 and papp5 plants following C) Mg-ProtoIX or D) ALA feeding is shown. Expression levels were compared to the respective mock control for each genotype and relative expression was calculated using Ubiquitin-like protein (At4g36800) as internal standard. Each bar represents the mean ( SD) of at least three independent biological replicates. Significant differences relative to untreated control or Col0 were calculated according to t-test (a, P<0.001; b, P<0.005; d, P<0.05).. . . . . . Phosphatase activity is required to mediate the tetrapyrrole related plastid signal to the nucleus. To address whether PAPP5 phosphatase activity is required to transmit the tetrapyrrole-mediated plastid signal to the nucleus, we used okadaic acid to inhibit the phosphatase activity during the first 12 hours of illumination. Okadaic acid is a cytotoxin derived from algae that specifically blocks the PP5-2A type phosphatases [39] and it has been shown to reduce PAPP5 activity in vitro. [40]. LHCB2.4, GLK1 and GLK2 expression was significantly induced following okadaic acid treatment in crd compared to the untreated control (Figure 8). Thus, blocking phosphatase activity phenocopied the papp5crd phenotype in the crd single mutant and reverts the suppression of PhANG expression. These data demonstrates that phosphatase activity is important to mediate the retrograde signal to regulate PhANG expression in crd.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0060305.g008. Figure 8. .

Samples were collected following 12 h exposure to light. Each bar represents the mean ( SD) of three independent biological replicates. Significant differences relative to Col0 were calculated according to t-test (b, P<0.005; c, P<0.01; d, P<0.05)..
PMC2633612	Results. . AtCBP60g Expression is Induced in Response to Pathogen Attack and MAMPs. We noticed that, according to microarray data, Arabidopsis CBP60g (CaM-binding protein 60-like.g; At5g26920) was strongly up-regulated in response to infection by the virulent strain Psm ES4326 [48]. We used the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to monitor expression of this gene. Figure 1A shows that expression of CBP60g was induced between three and six hours after Psm ES4326 infection, and expression remained high for at least 24 hours. CBP60g expression was also induced between six and nine hours after infection by P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (Pst DC3000), but to a lesser extent. We further investigated CBP60g expression after MAMP treatments. We inoculated wild-type plants with Pst DC3000 hrcC, a strain defective in delivery of type-III effectors [49]. By three hours after inoculation, and continuing for at least 24 hours, CBP60g transcript levels were higher than in mock-treated controls. Infiltration with the purified MAMP, flg22, had an even stronger effect (Figure 1B). These results indicate that expression of CBP60g is induced in response to bacterial pathogens and MAMPs.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g001. Figure 1. . Changes in CBP60g expression levels after pathogen or MAMP inoculation.. Each bar represents the log2 ratio of the mean expression value in treated plants relative to mock-treated plants. Data were normalized using the control gene ACTIN2. Data were obtained in three independent experiments, each with two technical replicates, and analyzed by ANOVA. Error bars represent standard error. (A) CBP60g expression in response to inoculation with Psm ES4326 or Pst DC3000 inoculation. (B) CBP60g expression in response to Pst DC3000 hrcC or flg22 inoculation.. . . . . . Mutations in AtCBP60g Result in Enhanced Susceptibility to P. syringae. We studied the function of CBP60g using loss-of-function mutants. We acquired two T-DNA insertion mutants of CBP60g, SALK_023199 and GABI_075G12, and named them cbp60g-1 and cbp60g-2, respectively. According to the SIGnAL database (http://signal.salk.edu/), the T-DNA insertion of cbp60g-1 is located in the third exon of At5g26920, while in cbp60g-2 it is in the fifth exon, as shown in Figure 2A. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) showed that the CBP60g transcript was absent in cbp60g-1 homozygotes and only partial in cbp60g-2 homozygotes (Figure 2B), suggesting that neither mutant allele produces functional CBP60g protein.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g002. Figure 2. . Mutants of CBP60g support more bacterial growth than wild-type plants.. (A) Illustration of CBP60g mutants cbp60g-1 and cpb60g-2.

(C) Bacterial growth assays using Psm ES4326. Each bar at 0 hours or 72 hours represents data from 4 or at least 16 replicates, respectively. Error bars represent standard deviation from 16 samples. Asterisks, p<0.05. P values were calculated using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. Similar results for the cbp60g mutants were obtained in two other independent experiments. Complemented, cbp60g-1 plants carrying wild-type CBP60g as a transgene; Without transgene; siblings of the complemented plants lacking the transgene.. . . . To test cbp60g mutants for enhanced susceptibility to P. syringae, wild type (Col-0), cbp60g-1, and cbp60g-2 plants were inoculated with Psm ES4326, and bacterial titer was determined three days later. Figure 2C shows that both mutant lines supported significantly more bacterial growth than wild-type plants, but less than the extremely susceptible pad4 plants [22]. The fact that two independent mutations in CBP60g result in similar enhanced susceptibility phenotypes strongly suggests that these phenotypes result from mutations in CBP60g. This idea was further verified by introducing a genomic clone containing CBP60g and its promoter (1093 base pairs upstream of its start codon) into homozygous cbp60g-1 plants. The progeny of a transformant that was hemizygous for the transgene were infected with Psm ES4326 and bacterial titers in individual plants were determined three days later. The average titer in plants carrying the wild-type transgene was similar to wild-type plants, while the average titer in sibling plants lacking the transgene was significantly higher and similar to untransformed cbp60g-1 homozygotes. Pst DC3000 also grew to higher titers in cbp60g mutants than in wild-type plants, and this phenotype was also complemented by a wild-type CBP60g transgene as shown in Figure 2D. Based on these experiments, we conclude that CBP60g is required for wild-type levels of resistance to both Psm ES4326 and Pst DC3000.. . . Expression Profiling of cbp60g-1 Suggests a Defect in MAMP-Triggered SA Signaling. In an effort to understand how cbp60g mutations affect defense responses against bacterial pathogens, we conducted microarray profiling experiments using a customized long-oligonucleotide microarray with probes for 464 pathogen-responsive genes, representing diverse expression patterns [50]. Expression profiling and data analysis using the custom microarray were carried out as described in Methods. First, we compared wild-type and homozygous cbp60g-1 plants 24 hours after inoculation with Psm ES4326. Other than CBP60g itself, there was only one gene (COR47, At1g20440) that was significantly different from wild-type by more than two-fold (Table S1). These results indicated that CBP60g did not have a major effect on gene expression 24 hours after Psm ES4326 infection.. Since CBP60g is also inducible by MAMP treatments, we tested the cbp60g-1 mutant for alterations in gene expression following inoculation with Pst DC3000 hrcC. Wild-type and cbp60g-1 plants were mock-inoculated or inoculated with Pst DC3000 hrcC, and samples were collected after three and nine hours, when MAMP-triggered responses generally occur [51],[52]. At three hours after inoculation with Pst DC3000 hrcC, 31 genes showed differential expression between wild-type and cbp60g-1 plants (q<0.05) as shown in Table S2. At nine hours, 43 genes were differentially expressed (q<0.05). Clearly, the effect of CBP60g on gene expression changes during a MAMP response is larger than it is 24 hours after Psm ES4326 inoculation.. To determine in which sector of the defense signaling network CBP60g acts, we compared the effects of cbp60g-1 on the response to DC3000 hrcC to the effects of other mutations that perturb the defense signaling network. We chose pad4 and sid2, which reduce SA signaling [26],[53]; coi1 and dde2, which reduce JA signaling [54],[55]; ein2, which reduces ethylene signaling [56], and mpk3, which may affect MAMP signaling [57]. Wild-type and mutant plants were inoculated with Pst DC3000 hrcC and wild-type plants were also mock-inoculated. Samples were again collected after three and nine hours. We selected genes with significantly different expression levels in at least one of the seven mutants compared to wild-type, after Pst DC3000 hrcC inoculation (q<0.05; Table S2). Among these, we further selected genes that were induced or repressed by at least two-fold in wild-type plants inoculated with Pst DC3000 hrcC compared to mock-inoculated wild-type plants. For the 88 genes that met these conditions at the three hour time point, the log2 ratios of cbp60g to Col-0, coi1-1 to Col-0, dde2-2 to Col-0, ein2-1 to Col-0, mpk3 to Col-0, pad4-1 to Col-0, and sid2-2 to Col-0 were subjected to complete-linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering [58]. The same procedure was carried out on the 77 genes that met these conditions at the nine hour time point. Figure 3 shows that the effects of cbp60g most closely resembled those of sid2 and pad4, which disrupt SA signaling during the MAMP response. At nine hours, the correlations between the cbp60g to Col log2 ratios and the pad4 to Col and sid2 to Col log2 ratios were 0.75 and 0.68, respectively as shown in Table 1. As PAD4 and SID2 function in SA signaling, these strong correlations between the effects of cbp60g and those of mutations known to disrupt SA signaling suggested that CBP60g functions in activation of SA signaling during the MAMP response.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g003. Figure 3. . Expression patterns identified by agglomerative hierarchical clustering.. The log2 ratios of each indicated sample comparison were used for the analysis.

SID2 Expression and Free SA Levels Are Reduced in cbp60g Mutants. The microarray data also revealed that SID2 was induced by Pst DC3000 hrcC inoculation in wild-type plants (1.74-fold at three hours and 3.02-fold at nine hours), and that this induction was attenuated in cbp60g mutant plants (the ratio of SID2 expression in cbp60g-1 to wild-type is 0.34 at three hours and 0.38 at nine hours). The qRT-PCR results shown in Figure 4A confirmed that SID2 expression was induced by DC3000 hrcC inoculation and flg22 treatment, as we have reported previously [33]. SID2 expression was reduced in both cbp60g mutants, with statistically significant differences observed three hours after flg22 treatment and nine hours after DC3000 hrcC inoculation. Since SID2 is required for SA synthesis during the defense response, we suspected that SA accumulation was also compromised in cbp60g mutants.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g004. Figure 4. . SID2 expression and SA accumulation in cbp60g mutants.. (A) SID2 expression in Col-0 and cbp60g mutants after flg22 or Pst DC3000 hrcC (hrcC) treatment. Each bar represents the log2 expression value relative to ACTIN2. Data was obtained in three independent experiments, each with two technical replicates, analyzed by ANOVA. Error bars represent standard error. (B) Measurement of free SA after flg22 or Pst DC3000 hrcC treatments. (C) Measurement of free SA after Psm ES4326 treatment. For B and C, data from two independent experiments, each consisting of one sample of each type, was analyzed by ANOVA. Error bars represent standard error.. . . . To determine whether SA levels were lower in cbp60g mutants, we measured free (non-conjugated) SA levels in wild-type, cbp60g, and sid2 plants following mock treatment, flg22 treatment, and DC3000 hrcC inoculation. Figure 4B shows that SA levels in both cbp60g mutants were significantly lower than in wild-type plants at six and nine hours following flg22 treatment and at nine hours following DC3000 hrcC inoculation (note the log10 scale). SA levels in sid2 plants were very low and did not respond to treatments. We also measured free SA levels in cbp60g-1 following inoculation with Psm ES4326 or the avirulent strain Psm ES4326 avrRpt2. After Psm ES4326 inoculation, the SA level in cbp60g-1 was only lower than in wild-type plants at nine hours after inoculation (q=0.002) but not 24, and the extent of the reduction at 9 hours was less than in the case of flg22 or Pst DC3000 hrcC treatments (Figure 4C). To verify that the SA difference we observed in Psm ES4326-inoculated plants was not due to enhanced bacterial growth in the cbp60g-1 mutant, we monitored bacterial titers in the plants used for SA extraction. As shown in Figure S2, no significant differences in titer were observed among wild type and cbp60g-1 mutants at 9 or 24 hours after inoculation. After Psm ES4326 avrRpt2 inoculation, there were no significant differences (q<0.05) in SA accumulation between wild-type and cbp60g mutants (Figure S3). Taken together, these results show that CBP60g contributes to SA accumulation during the MAMP response and at early times during attack by Psm ES4326.. . . CBP60g Mutants Do Not Affect the flg22-Triggered ROS Burst, Callose Deposition, or flg22 Inhibition of Seedling Growth. Having observed that cbp60g mutants were deficient in MAMP-induced SA accumulation, we tested cbp60g mutants for defects in other MAMP-triggered responses. Three characteristic MAMP signaling responses are transient production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), deposition of callose, and inhibition of seedling growth [51]. We monitored flg22-induced ROS production in wild-type, cbp60g-1, cbp60g-2, and fls2 plants. FLS2 encodes the flagellin receptor, thus fls2 mutants do not respond to flg22. There was no difference in production of ROS between wild-type plants and cbp60g mutants, while ROS production was abolished in fls2 plants (Figure S4). Callose deposition at twelve hours after flg22 treatment was assayed by aniline blue staining and image analysis. No significant differences were observed among wild type and cbp60g mutants (Figure S5). No callose deposition was observed in pmr4 mutants, which lack a callose synthase [59]. Clearly, cbp60g mutants are not defective in flg22-induced ROS production or callose deposition. Seedling growth is inhibited by flg22. We tested wild-type, cbp60g, pad4, sid2, and fls2 seedlings for inhibition by flg22. We found that cbp60g, pad4, and sid2 plants all showed growth inhibition similar to wild-type plants, while fls2 mutants showed very little growth inhibition (Figure S6). Thus, mutations that reduce MAMP-induced SA production do not have a major effect on inhibition of seedling growth by flg22.. . . CBP60g Is a CaM Binding Protein with the Calmodulin Binding Domain Located at the N Terminus. Five of the eight CBP60 proteins have a CaM binding domain (CBD) at the C terminus [44]. However, the corresponding sequence of CBP60g is poorly conserved (Figure S1). In order to test whether CBP60g binds to CaM and identify possible CBD domain(s) of CBP60g, we predicted its coiled coil domains using the PredictProtein algorithm [60], as this protein secondary structure is shared by nearly all known CBDs [61]. Figure 5A shows the positions of the predicted coiled coil domains.. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g005. Figure 5. . Mapping and site-directed mutagenesis of the CBP60g CaM-binding domain..

(C) Helical wheel projection of the CBP60g CaM-binding domain. Amino acids selected for mutagenesis are circled. (D) CaM binding assay of mutated GST-tagged CBP60g proteins. Upper picture, CaM binding; lower picture, detection of GST.. . . . We tested the ability of CBP60g to bind CaM by constructing a GST-CBP60g protein fusion and expressing it in Escherichia coli. Western blotting with anti-GST antibody showed that a protein of the expected molecular weight (approximately 89 kilodaltons) was produced. A replicate blot was incubated with biotinylated CaM. Bound CaM was then detected with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Figure 5B shows that full-length CBP60g protein bound to CaM. No binding was observed in the absence of Ca2+ (Figure S7).. We then tested various CBP60g deletion mutants (Figure 6A) in an effort to locate the CaM binding domain (CBD). Figure 6B shows that a 76 amino acid fragment from the N-terminus of the protein was sufficient for CaM binding. Further deletions revealed that a fragment of only 45 amino acids retained CaM binding capability (Figure S8). According to the CaM target database (http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb), this amino acid sequence does not contain any of the known CaM-binding motifs. However, as shown in Figure 5c, it does contain a predicted coiled coil domain, and it is amphipathic, a property shared by almost all CBDs [61].. . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301.g006. Figure 6. .

Data were pooled from two independent experiments. Samples were extracted from six leaves for each genotype in each replicate. Error bars represent standard error calculated by ANOVA. Asterisks indicate p<0.01.. . . . Previous studies showed that disruption of amphipathic properties of CBDs abolished CaM binding [41],[62], so we further defined the CBD of CBP60g using site-directed mutagenesis. Based on the helical wheel projection of the CBP60g CBD (Figure 5C), we mutated the codons for all four hydrophobic amino acids (three valines and one phenylalanine) on the hydrophobic side to create codons for hydrophilic amino acids (arginine or lysine). As controls we also mutated codons for two amino acids on the hydrophilic side of the CBP60g CBD and one amino acid just outside the CBD. These changes did not affect the amphipathic nature of the predicted helix. Figure 5D shows that loss of any of the four hydrophobic amino acids on the hydrophobic side of the CBD abolished CaM binding, while none of the other mutations had a detectable effect. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that CBP60g is a CaM-binding protein, and defined the CBD in the N-terminus of the protein.. . . CaM Binding Is Required for CBP60g Function in Disease Resistance and SA Accumulation. CaM binding often modulates protein function [40]. To investigate whether CaM binding affects the function of CBP60g in defense responses, we engineered transgenic plants carrying mutated CBP60g proteins that no longer bind CaM in the cbp60g-1 mutant background. We then tested them for defects in limiting bacterial growth and SA accumulation. We transformed cbp60g-1 mutant plants with modified genomic constructs including both CaM-binding (F41K) and non-CaM-binding (V28K, V29R) versions of CBP60g, which were fused to a c-Myc epitope tag at their C-termini. A wild-type version of the CBP60g c-Myc fusion construct (WT) was also made as a control. Primary transformants containing single copies of the transgenes were selected by qPCR, and their progeny were used for analyses. First, we tested expression of the modified proteins by immunoblotting using c-Myc antibody. None of the c-Myc fusion proteins were detected in untreated plants, but they were all present in plants inoculated with Psm ES4326. This was also true for the wild-type CBP60g c-Myc fusion construct (Figure S9A). Thus, the Psm ES4326-induced increase in the CBP60g transcript level is reflected in the protein level. We then measured bacterial growth and SA accumulation in the transgenic plants. Figure 6A shows that 2 days after inoculation with Psm ES4326, bacterial titers in transgenic lines carrying non-CaM-binding constructs were similar to the titers in cbp60g-1, while titers in transgenic lines carrying the CaM-binding construct were similar to those in wild-type plants. We assayed four additional independent transgenic lines for bacterial growth, yielding consistent results (Figure S9B). This shows that CaM binding is required for complementation of the enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype of cbp60g-1. We also measured free SA levels in leaves after treatment with flg22 or infection by Psm ES4326. Figure 6B shows that the non-CaM-binding proteins, V28K and V29R, failed to complement the SA accumulation defects of cbp60g-1, while the protein that did bind CaM, F41K, restored SA to wild-type levels. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CBP60g requires CaM binding for its function in disease resistance and MAMP-induced SA accumulation..
PMC2712097	Results. . PSY expression is rate-limiting in calli but not in green seedlings. We investigated the effects of PSY overexpression in green and non-green tissues, seedlings and calli of Arabidopsis lines expressing the PSY ORF from Arabidopsis (AtPSY) under the control of the constitutive, non-tissue-specific CaMV35S promoter (35S::AtPSY). Seedlings of three 35S::AtPSY lines grown for two weeks were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type seedlings. Carotenoids as well as AtPSY transcript levels were determined by HPLC and Real-Time RT-PCR, respectively. Although AtPSY transcripts increased 14 to 17-fold, carotenoid levels and accumulation patterns as well as chlorophylls remained unchanged as compared to wild-type seedlings (Figure 1A and D, left).. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0006373.g001. Figure 1. . Carotenoid content, AtPSY transcript and protein levels in AtPSY overexpressing lines.. Seedlings (left side) from wild type (wt) and from three 35S::AtPSY lines (#12, #22, #23) were grown for two weeks on MS plates. For seed-derived calli (SDC), seedlings were germinated on callus-inducing medium under long-day conditions for 5 days, followed by 16 days of darkness.

The signal corresponding to the imported AtPSY protein is marked with an arrow. Protein levels of actin are shown as a loading control. C: Internal normalization of AtPSY relative to actin in the corresponding sample. D: AtPSY transcript levels determined by Real-Time RT-PCR using total RNA. Transcript levels were normalized to 18S rRNA levels of the corresponding sample and expressed relative to the content in the wild type. Data represent the mean of three biological replicates.. . . . Calli were induced from germinating seeds, leaves, stems and roots of 35S::AtPSY lines as well as from the wild type. Since all the transgenic calli responded almost equally with respect to carotenoid accumulation (data not shown), seed-derived calli (SDC) were chosen for all further experimentation. These calli were generated by germinating seeds on callus-inducing medium for 5 days under long-day conditions, followed by 16 days in darkness. During etiolation, the transgenic lines developed intensely orange-colored calli, while those of the wild type were much less colored (Figure 2A). Quantitative HPLC revealed an approximately 10-fold increase in carotenoid levels compared to the wild type (Figure 1A, right), together with changes in carotenoid accumulation patterns. While wild-type SDC accumulated mainly xanthophylls and only trace amounts of beta-carotene, the latter was the main constituent in 35S::AtPSY SDC, followed by xanthophylls and carotene intermediates, like phytoene and phytofluene.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0006373.g002.

Seedlings after 5 days development in light (left) and after 7, 12 and 16 days etiolation are shown. C-F: beta-carotene crystal formation in SDC generated from the 35S::AtPSY line after 16 days in darkness. In addition to small bead-like, orange colored structures (C), the formation of large bar-shaped structures was observed in SDC protoplasts by light microscopy (D). As confirmed by polarization microscopy, these structures represent carotenoid crystals (E); an overlay of D and E is shown in F. A protoplast from wild-type SDC is shown in B. c, carotenoid crystals; v, vacuole.. . . . . . PSY protein levels correlate with increased carotenoid (beta-carotene) levels in seed-derived calli but not in leaves. We compared the response of leaves and SDC to AtPSY overexpression by determining the AtPSY protein levels in both tissues using affinity-purified anti-AtPSY antibodies.. Three AtPSY bands were observed on western blots with seedlings as well as with SDC (Figure 1B and 3A). The 42 kD band corresponds to the mature protein after import into plastids. It co-migrates with the radiolabelled in-vitro translation product lacking the transit peptide on PAGE gels [29]. Similar internal standards also allowed relating the uppermost band (48 kD) to the unprocessed cytoplasmatic protein (data not shown). An intermediate form (ca. 45 kD) was observed in most cases but was not further investigated.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0006373.g003. Figure 3. . Carotenoid and chlorophyll content, PSY protein and transcript levels during SDC development.. Seeds from wild type (left) and a 35S::AtPSY line (right) were germinated on callus-inducing medium under long-day conditions for 5 days, followed by 16 days of darkness. Samples were taken at the time of transfer to darkness (0 days) and after 7, 12 and 16 days etiolation. A: Western blot analysis of AtPSY protein levels using 60 g of SDC protein extracts. The protein levels of actin are shown as a loading control. B: Carotenoid and chlorophyll content in SDC as determined by quantitative HPLC. C: Real-Time RT-PCR using total RNA isolated from wild type and 35S::AtPSY SDC. Transcript levels were normalized to 18S rRNA levels of the corresponding sample and expressed relative to the content in the wild type after 5 days of growth in the light. Expression level for AtPSY in 35S::AtPSY is 20-fold compared to the wild type after 5 days in the light (not shown). Data represent the mean of three technical replicates. PSY, phytoene synthase; eLCY, lycopene epsilon-cyclase; bLCY, lycopene beta-cyclase; bHYD1/2, betacarotene hydroxylase 1/2.. . . . Both tissue types imported the overexpressed protein almost quantitatively into plastids; the concentration of unprocessed precursors did not rise. Therefore, the translocation step is not rate limiting and is thus not the cause for the differential response.. In fact, both transcript and protein levels were found to be substantially higher in green leaves of the transgenic lines as compared to the wild type (Figure 1B). This means that the high carotenoid content in seedlings prevents the overexpressed AtPSY from raising carotenoid levels further. In the wild type, even low levels of AtPSY saturate the system. This contrasts with the situation in calli, where AtPSY overexpression is capable of very substantially increasing the low carotenoid levels present in the wild type. Therefore, in green tissues, a relatively small amount of AtPSY is sufficient to produce high carotenoid levels while in SDC a much higher amount of AtPSY is needed to drive carotenoid levels up to seedling levels. AtPSY expression is thus rate-limiting in photosynthetically inactive calli but not in green seedlings.. . . Rerouting of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in 35S::AtPSY SDC leads to beta-carotene accumulation. We investigated carotenoid and transcript levels of carotenoid pathway genes during the process of SDC formation from wild-type plants and siblings of one 35S::AtPSY line (Figure 3B, C). Data were collected after growth in the light and during subsequent etiolation for 7, 12 and 16 days. This revealed that during the light period, SDC of the 35S::AtPSY line had accumulated more than double as much carotenoids as wild-type SDC. Although beta-carotene content increased about 3-fold compared with wild-type SDC at this point, it represented only 20% of total carotenoids, while xanthophylls contributed about 66%. Phytoene and phytofluene, which were absent in wild-type calli, were already present at this stage. During the subsequent 16 days of growth in the dark, xanthophylls decreased to about 25% of total carotenoid content, while beta-carotene and to a minor extent also alpha-carotene, increased strongly, contributing to ca. 50% (or 650 g/g dry weight) of total carotenoid content after 16 days. Remarkably, this pattern shift did not affect total carotenoid content, which remained as high as before.. In contrast, under the same regime, total carotenoids in wild-type SDC decreased by about 75% due to losses across all carotenoids determined. With the disappearance of chlorophylls (Figure 3B) carotenoids became visible (Figure 2A).. Hydroxylation of beta-carotene is strongly downregulated under dark conditions in both wild type and transgenics, as revealed by Real-Time RT-PCR (Figure 3C). Similarly, the transcripts of epsilon-cyclase fell to about 10% of the light levels, while beta-cyclase levels were less affected (ca. 50%), and phytoene desaturase, zeta-carotene desaturase and carotenoid isomerase decreased to about 30% (data not shown). In 35S::AtPSY SDC, expression of the transgene was 20 times higher than in the wild type, while transcript levels of the other carotenoid pathway genes decreased to the same low levels as wild-type SDC (Figure 3C, right). This indicates that the strong beta-carotene accumulation results from AtPSY overexpression accompanied by rerouting of the pathway towards the beta-branch. The shift is caused by expression changes occurring during the transition to non-green callus cells and not by changes induced by AtPSY overexpression.. The decrease of carotenoid levels reflects carotenoid turnover. One interpretation is that decreasing levels of AtPSY and other carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes in wild-type SDC can no longer compensate for carotenoid turnover unless the rate of biosynthesis is increased by AtPSY overexpression.. . . In SDC expressing AtPSY constitutively beta-carotene is deposited in crystals. In chromoplasts, carotenoids are deposited in specialized structures such as plastoglobules, fibrils, crystals or proliferated membranes. Since Arabidopsis cannot form chromoplasts, we set out to determine the mode of carotenoid deposition in plastids of dark-grown 35S::AtPSY SDC accumulating ca. 1800 g/g dry weight of these compounds, which is well in the range of crystal formation in chromoplasts. Carrots, for instance, contain 2000 to 4000 g carotenoids/g dry weight [30] and tomatoes accumulate ca. 2000 g/g dry weight [22].. Microscopy revealed that wild-type protoplasts contained unpigmented proplastids (Figure 2B) while orange-colored particles were present in small numbers (1-5 per cell) in 35S::AtPSY protoplasts (Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 2 (D-F), polarization microscopy revealed that the carotenoid particles in 35S::AtPSY SDC were birefringent, which is distinctive of their crystal nature.. . . Carotenoid crystal formation in roots. Given that SDC reflect the situation in non-green plant cells, roots should respond similarly to PSY overexpression. In fact, as shown in Figure 4C, wild-type roots accumulated only trace amounts of carotenoids while those of 35S::AtPSY lines accumulated ca. 100 times more. In addition, the carotenoid composition pattern was very similar to SDC, consisting mainly of beta-carotene and the intermediates phytoene and phytofluene (Figure 4A). Just like in callus tissues, carotenoid increase in roots correlated with increased AtPSY protein, which was almost undetectable in wild-type roots (Figure 4D). Real-Time RT-PCR showed that carotenoid accumulation correlated with increased expression levels of AtPSY (Figure 4E) but did not affect expression levels of other carotenoid genes (AtPDS, AtZDS, AtbLCY, AteLCY, AtbHYD1, AtbHYD2; Figure S1). Polarization microscopy of protoplasts prepared from roots of 35S::AtPSY lines revealed an identical mode of carotenoid sequestration into birefringent carotenoid particles (Figure S2). Thus, roots mirror the situation in SDC almost perfectly.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0006373.g004. Figure 4. . Carotenoid accumulation in roots of 35S::AtPSY lines.. Arabidopsis wild type (wt) and two 35S::AtPSY lines (#12, #22) were grown hydroponically for two weeks; roots were harvested and used for analysis. Root carotenoid amounts (C) and a comparison of carotenoid composition patterns in SDC and roots from wild type (A) and 35S::AtPSY line#12 (B) are shown. Percentages of single carotenoids or carotenoids groups relative to total carotenoid amount are given in brackets. Phy, phytoene; flu, phytofluene; beta-car, beta-carotene; alpha-car, alpha-carotene; xan, other xanthophylls; car, other carotenoids; lut, lutein.

E: AtPSY transcript levels were normalized to 18S rRNA levels of the corresponding sample and expressed relative to the amounts detected in wild-type roots. Data represent the mean of three biological replicates.. . . . . . Carotenoid composition patterns and PSY expression in roots of cultivated carrots and Arabidopsis 35S::AtPSY lines are similar. The storage root of orange carrots (Daucus carota) represents the most popular beta-carotene accumulating tissue. The molecular basis of the massive carotenoid accumulation in carrots is still unclear. Path analysis on the offspring of crosses between white and orange-rooted cultivars suggested that in white roots the capability for phytoene formation was the limiting factor in carotenoid accumulation [31].. To test the hypothesis we analyzed a white-rooted wild carrot (D. carota subsp. carota, Queen Anne's Lace, QAL) and a cultivated variety with white roots (D. carota subsp. sativus var. Weisse Kttiger, KUT), as well as two orange-rooted cultivars (D. carota subsp. sativus, var. Chatenay Red Cored, CRC, and Nantaise 2, NAN). As shown in Figure 5 (A, B), white-rooted carrots and Arabidopsis wild-type roots were similarly low in carotenoids (6 g/g DW for Arabidopsis wild type, 5 for QAL, and 14 for KUT), which consisted mostly of xanthophylls and only a minor proportion of beta-carotene. Just like in Arabidopsis roots, carotenoid intermediates and alpha-carotene were virtually absent. The carotenoid levels in cultivated carrot roots (CRC, NAN) of 9-week old plants were as high as in SDC or roots overexpressing AtPSY (Figure 5B; compare Figure 4C and 1A). They accumulated around 800 g/g total carotenoids with about 42% beta-carotene, and were characterized by the presence of the pathway intermediates phytoene and phytofluene. The only difference was alpha-carotene, which accounted for about 20% of total carotenoids in carrots but only 5% in roots of Arabidopsis 35S::AtPSY lines.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0006373.g005. Figure 5. . Carotenoid accumulation in white and orange-colored carrot roots.. Two carrot varieties with white colored roots (QAL, Queen Anne's Lace, KUT, Kttiger) and two varieties with orange-colored roots (CRC, Chatenay Red Cored, NAN, Nantaise 2) were grown for 9 weeks. Roots were harvested and used for the quantification of carotenoids by HPLC (B). Carotenoid composition patterns for QAL and CRC roots are shown in A; the pattern for KUT was similar to QAL while that for NAN was similar to CRC. C Western blot analysis using 60 g of root protein extracts from carrots and one 35S::AtPSY line (#12). Affinity-purified anti-AtPSY antibodies were used. Actin protein levels are shown as loading control. Expression levels of DcPSY1 (D) and DcPSY2 (E) in carrot roots as determined by Real-Time RT-PCR. Transcript levels were normalized to 18S rRNA levels of the corresponding samples and are expressed relative to the expression level determined in roots of QAL. All data represent the mean of three biological replicates.. . . . The western blot analyses again mirrored the situation met in roots of Arabidopsis 35S::AtPSY lines. While in white-rooted carrots PSY was below the detection limit, roots of the orange-rooted varieties showed a strong PSY signal (Figure 5C). We cloned the PSY cDNAs from QAL and CRC to make sure that antibody specificity and enzymatic activity were not affecting the interpretation of the results. Two PSY genes are present in the carrot genome (DcPSY1, DcPSY2; [20]), and they were identical in QAL and CRC.. We investigated whether the increase of PSY protein correlated with PSY transcript levels by Real-Time RT-PCR (Figure 5D, E). While transcript levels of DcPSY2 were almost equivalent in the white-rooted carrots QAL and KUT, DcPSY1 transcript levels were about three times higher in KUT than in QAL. In the orange-rooted cultivars CRC and NAN, DcPSY1 transcript levels were 17 and 14-fold higher than in QAL roots, while DcPSY2 transcript levels were 8 and 5-fold higher, respectively.. . . Root-specific PSY expression in white carrots leads to yellow-colored roots. Seemingly, the correlation of PSY protein abundance and carotenoid levels in non-photosynthetic tissues of Arabidopsis and carrot roots represents a common theme. Differential expression of other carotenogenic genes does not seem to be required to drive carotenoid overproduction, as can be concluded from comparative transcriptional analysis conducted with several carrot cultivars differing in root color [32].. Consequently, increased PSY in a white-rooted carrot background should produce colored carrot roots. To prove the point we generated transgenic QAL lines overexpressing the bacterial PSY crtB under the control of a storage root-specific promoter cloned from yam (Dioscorea spec.; Arango et al., unpublished; yam::crtB). In fact, roots of about 8-week old heterozygous T1 transformants exhibited intense yellow color (see Figure 6A). However, the carotenoid composition pattern showed some differences compared to orange carrot roots. beta-carotene accounted for only 10% of total carotenoids in most lines, with only one line (yam::crtB#3) containing about 30% beta-carotene (Figure 6B, C). Carotene intermediates, mainly phytoene, but also phytofluene, zeta-carotene, and lycopene predominated in roots of all lines, and alpha-carotene was absent. The pattern remained constant during prolonged growth while carotenoid levels increased from about 180 g/g DW at 8 weeks to 400 g/g DW at 16 weeks.. . 10.1371/journal.pone.0006373.g006. Figure 6. . Root-specific overexpression of PSY in QAL.. White-rooted wild carrots (QAL, Queen Anne's Lace) were transformed with a construct containing the bacterial PSY crtB downstream of a root-specific promoter from yam. A: Transverse section of roots from untransformed QAL (left) and yam::crtB line #3 (right) from 16-week old plants. B: Carotenoid content and composition pattern of untransformed QAL and four different yam::crtB QAL lines as determined by HPLC. The age of the plants is indicated below the diagram. The values represent the mean of two biological replicates. C: Relative percentage of carotenoids in 16-week-old plant of yam::crtB line #3. For abbreviations, see Figure 4. D: Light microscopy of root thin section of a yam::crtB line (left) and CRC (right).. . . . Even though carotenoid content was lower in roots of yam::crtB lines than in orange carrot roots, carotenoid sequestration into crystals followed the same pattern as in roots of cultivated carrots (Figure 6D). From this we conclude that only increased PSY protein levels are required to attain both high carotenoid levels as well as crystal formation, while carotenoid composition patterns may vary..
PMC3961177	Results. . UVR8 variants differentially interact with COP1 in yeast. In order to assess the roles of key residues in UVR8, we generated six UVR8 variants in two groups based on their functional classification via site-directed mutagenesis. The first group, which included UVR8W233A, UVR8W233F, UVR8W285A and UVR8W285F, and the second group, which included UVR8R286A and UVR8R338A, were designed to interrupt UVR8's perception of UV-B light and dimer stabilization respectively (Figure S1A). As yeast has been widely used as an efficient system to determine the conformational status of UVR8 and its interaction with other proteins in response to UV-B [7], [21], [22], we first introduced wild-type and these six mutated UVR8 (mUVR8) into yeast. Using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by immunoblot analyses, we found that UVR8WT was dimeric under -UV-B and monomeric under +UV-B (Figure 1A), while UVR8W233F, UVR8W285A and UVR8W285F were constitutively monomeric, monomeric and dimeric respectively (Figure 1A). This is consistent with the results reported previously [7]. The other UVR8 variants, UVR8W233A, UVR8R286A and UVR8W338A appeared as monomers irrespective of UV-B treatment (Figure 1A). These results demonstrate that in yeast, in addition to the dimer-stabilizing arginines, R286 and R338, the light-absorbing tryptophans, W233 and W285, critically contribute to the dimer-to-monomer switch of UVR8 upon UV-B irradiation.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004218.g001. Figure 1. . UVR8 variants display altered interaction with COP1 in yeast.. (A) Conformational status of wild-type and mutated UVR8 proteins in yeast. Total proteins of yeast expressing LexA fused wild-type and mutated UVR8 were extracted and incubated under -UV-B and +UV-B for 20 min. Protein samples without heat denaturation were assayed in SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis by anti-LexA antibody. Staining by Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) is shown as a loading control. The asterisks indicate unspecific degradation products. (B) Interaction of wild-type and mutated UVR8 proteins with COP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Transformants in the respective combinations were incubated under -UV-B and +UV-B for 16 h.. . . . We next performed a series of yeast two-hybrid assays in order to examine the effects of the UVR8 mutations on the interaction between UVR8 and COP1. While COP1 only interacted with UVR8WT under +UV-B, it interacted with UVR8W233A, UVR8W233F, UVR8W285A, UVR8R286A and UVR8R338A under both -UV-B and +UV-B. The interaction between UVR8W285F and COP1 was barely observed (Figure 1B). These results suggest that the UVR8-COP1 interaction in yeast requires UVR8 to be in its monomeric form. Furthermore, previous studies have also proposed that RUP1 and RUP2 interact with UVR8 independent of UV-B irradiation [19]. Specifically, it has been suggested that these two proteins mediate UVR8 redimerization and disrupt UVR8-COP1 interaction, so as to facilitate the inactivation of the photoreceptor [18]. In yeast, RUP1 was found to constitutively interact with UVR8W233A, UVR8W233F, UVR8W285A and UVR8R286A, but was not observed to interact with UVR8WT, UVR8W285F and UVR8R338A. Differently, RUP2 was observed to interact with the wild-type UVR8 and all the mutant UVR8 proteins (Figure S1B). These results collectively suggest that light perception and conformational change of UVR8 are both major determinants of its interaction with key players of UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis.. . . UVR8 variants alter physiological responses to photomorphogenic UV-B in Arabidopsis. . To investigate the biological activity of these UVR8 variants in Arabidopsis, we introduced wild-type and mutated UVR8 fused with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) driven by the native UVR8 promoter into the uvr8 null mutant uvr8-6 background. As expected, proUVR8-YFP-UVR8/uvr8-6 (YFP-UVR8WT) was found to express the transgenic UVR8 protein at a level comparable to the endogenous UVR8 protein in Col under -UV-B and +UV-B (Figure S2A). It was able to rescue uvr8-6 in UV-B-induced hypocotyl growth and anthocyanin accumulation (Figures 2A, 2B and 2C) which are characteristic physiological responses to photomorphogenic UV-B [14], [23]. We next examined these two responses in the six transgenic UVR8 variants expressing YFP-UVR8 proteins at equivalent levels to that in YFP-UVR8WT (Figure 2D). The hypocotyl shortening in all the variants failed to reach the shortening degree detected in YFP-UVR8WT. Interestingly, YFP-UVR8W285A and YFP-UVR8R338A displayed shorter hypocotyl than YFP-UVR8WT under -UV-B, while YFP-UVR8R338A instead of YFP-UVR8W285A showed further shortened hypocotyl under +UV-B (Figures 2A and 2B). Furthermore, compared with YFP-UVR8WT, reduced anthocyanin accumulation was found in YFP-UVR8W233A, YFP-UVR8W233F, YFP-UVR8W285F and YFP-UVR8R286A under both -UV-B and +UV-B. In contrast, enhanced anthocyanin accumulation was detected in YFP-UVR8W285A and YFP-UVR8R338A under -UV-B. YFP-UVR8R338A was even able to accumulate anthocyanin under +UV-B, though at a level lower than that in YFP-UVR8WT (Figure 2C).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004218.g002. Figure 2. .

(D) Immunoblot assay of wild-type and mutated UVR8 proteins (by anti-GFP antibody) in 4-day-old transgenic seedlings grown under -UV-B and +UV-B. Anti-RPN6 was used as a loading control.. . . . These observations showed that all the mutations interfered with UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis, though to varying degrees. The mutations in UV-B-absorbing residues resulted in more severe phenotypic defects than those in UVR8-dimerizing residues, suggesting the importance of the sequential action of UV-B light perception before UVR8 monomerization. Meanwhile, a specific activity of UVR8W285A and UVR8R338A is indicated by the constitutive short hypocotyl and high anthocyanin content found in YFP-UVR8W285A and YFP-UVR8R338A (Figures 2B and 2C).. . . UVR8 mutations affect UV-B-responsive gene expression. It is well known that differential transcriptomic regulation is orchestrated by photomorphogenic UV-B in Arabidopsis. [9], [13]. Using 4-day-old seedlings grown under -UV-B and +UV-B, we examined the expression pattern of several UV-B-responsive marker genes, EARLY LIGHT-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 2 (ELIP2), UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 84A1 (UGT84A1) and CHALCONE SYNTHASE (CHS). The UV-B-induced activation of these genes observed in YFP-UVR8WT was largely impaired in YFP-UVR8W233A, YFP-UVR8W233F, YFP-UVR8W285A, YFP-UVR8W285F and YFP-UVR8R286A, while the activation was readily detected in YFP-UVR8R338A though it showed a reduced induction of UGT84A1. Again, we noticed YFP-UVR8W285A and YFP-UVR8R338A as these two variants accumulated higher transcript levels of these genes than YFP-UVR8WT under -UV-B (Figures 3A, 3B and 3C).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004218.g003. Figure 3. . UVR8 mutations lead to abnormal UV-B-responsive gene expression..

(F-G) Immunoblot assay of COP1 and HY5 proteins (by anti-COP1 and anti-HY5 antibodies) in 4-day-old seedlings grown under -UV-B and +UV-B. Anti-RPN6 was used as a loading control. The asterisk indicates an unspecific cross-reactive band.. . . . In addition to these marker genes, key regulators of UV-B specific signaling, including the positive regulators COP1 and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) are also transcriptionally governed by photomorphogenic UV-B [24], [25]. We found that the accumulation of COP1 mRNA was diminished in all UVR8 variants with the exception of YFP-UVR8R338A (Figure 3D). Similarly, though the accumulation of HY5 mRNA was observed in YFP-UVR8W233F and YFP-UVR8R338A, it was limited in YFP-UVR8W233A, YFP-UVR8W285A, YFP-UVR8W285F and YFP-UVR8R286A (Figure 3E). At the post-transcriptional level, COP1 protein was clearly induced in YFP-UVR8WT, YFP-UVR8W233F and YFP-UVR8R338A, slightly increased in YFP-UVR8W233A under +UV-B, and relatively high under both -UV-B and +UV-B in YFP-UVR8W285A. However, the accumulation of COP1 protein mediated by photomorphogenic UV-B was scarcely detected in YFP-UVR8W285F and YFP-UVR8R286A (Figures 3F and 3G). A similar pattern was observed for the case of HY5 protein accumulation (Figures 3F and 3G). Taken together, the altered expression profiles of these UV-B responsive genes suggest that these residues responsible for UV-B light perception and UVR8 dimerization are crucial for UVR8 activity in the transcriptional control of UV-B signaling at a molecular level.. Downstream of UVR8-COP1, RUP1 and RUP2 contribute to the negative feedback regulation of UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis. Given that RUP1 and RUP2 are known to be induced by photomorphogenic UV-B dependent on UVR8, COP1 and HY5 [19], it was noteworthy that the accumulation of RUP1 and RUP2 mRNA was apparently reduced in all UVR8 variants except UVR8R338A (Figures 4A and 4B). As early UV-B responsive genes, RUP1 and RUP2 were activated in a temporal manner in response to photomorphogenic UV-B to balance UV-B specific signaling [19]. Using 4-day-old seedlings grown under -UV-B and then transferred to +UV-B for various periods of time, we found that the temporal induction of RUP1 and RUP2 by photomorphogenic UV-B was apparently observed in YFP-UVR8WT, but was retarded in all the UVR8 variant lines (Figures 4C and 4D). It is worth pointing out that the transcript levels of RUP1 and RUP2 were elevated within 1 hours of UV-B irradiation to a peak and then fell back in YFP-UVR8WT, whereas they continued to rise to a lower peak particularly in YFP-UVR8W285A, YFP-UVR8R286A and YFP-UVR8R338A over the 12-hour UV-B treatment (Figures 4C and 4D). These results suggest that RUP1 and RUP2 fail to be activated in our UVR8 variants, and thus do not establish the repressive transcriptional modules required for balanced UV-B signaling. Overall, none of the UVR8 variants are functionally equivalent to YFP-UVR8WT, which was consistent with our phenotypic observations.. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004218.g004. Figure 4. .

In order to better understand the biochemical activity of these residues in vivo, we investigated the efficiency of UV-B light perception, UVR8 monomerization and the formation of UVR8-containing complex in all of our UVR8 variant plants. By measuring UV-B absorbance at 310 nm, the central wavelength of our photomorphogenic UV-B condition, we found that Col and YFP-UVR8WT exhibited a strong ability to sense UV-B. In contrast, mutations in either residue of the internal chromophore, W233 or W285, led to a complete loss of UV-B absorption. YFP-UVR8R286A and YFP-UVR8R338A retained the ability to sense UV-B, but at significantly diminished levels, which suggests that the disruption of the homodimeric interface has a negative impact on the full activity of UVR8 to perceive UV-B light (Figure 5A).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004218.g005.

The asterisks indicate unspecific degradation products. (C) In vivo co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays using 4-day-old seedlings grown under -UV-B and +UV-B by anti-GFP antibody. Immunoblot analysis was performed by anti-GFP and anti-COP1 antibodies. Anti-RPN6 was used as a un-immunoprecipitated and loading control.. . . . In SDS-PAGE analysis, we found that in response to photomorphogenic UV-B, while YFP-UVR8WT switched from dimer to monomer, none of YFP-UVR8 variant proteins showed a comparable conformational change. YFP-UVR8W233A, YFP-UVR8W233F, YFP-UVR8W285A, YFP-UVR8R286A and YFP-UVR8R338A were monomeric, while YFP- UVR8W285F was dimeric (Figure 5B). Thus the conformational profiles of wild-type and variant UVR8 observed in Arabidopsis were consistent with those found in yeast.. We next examined the endogenous association of UVR8 variants and COP1 by using in vivo co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. In agreement with previous studies [7], [14], YFP-UVR8WT co-immunoprecipitated a high level of COP1 specifically under +UV-B. However, independent of UV-B, YFP-UVR8W285F and YFP-UVR8R286A scarcely co-immunoprecipitated COP1, while YFP-UVR8W233F and YFP-UVR8W233A co-immunoprecipitated very low levels of COP1. YFP-UVR8W285A and YFP-UVR8R338A co-immunoprecipitated medium levels of COP1 under -UV-B, while the latter was also observed to co-immunoprecipitate more COP1 under +UV-B (Figure 5C). These results reveal that the monomeric conformation is not sufficient for UVR8 to associate with COP1 in vivo. The relatively close association of YFP-UVR8W285A and YFP-UVR8R338A with COP1 without UV-B treatment indicates that a specific activity of UVR8 might be produced by W285A or R338A mutation.. . . Constitutive activity of UVR8 is dependent on constant UVR8-COP1 interaction. As both cop1-4 and uvr8-6 suffer from diminished gene expression, hypocotyl growth, anthocyanin accumulation and acclimation in response to photomorphogenic UV-B, COP1 and UVR8 share a high degree of functional similarity in photomorphogenic UV-B signaling [14], [25]. We found that YFP-UVR8WT/cop1-4 phenocopied cop1-4 (Figure 6A), clearly demonstrating that COP1 acts genetically downstream of UVR8. The observation that YFP-UVR8WT failed to rescue cop1-4 (Figure 6A) also suggests that the function of UVR8 is dependent on COP1. Though CUL4 works in concert with COP1 in darkness, it functionally disassociates from COP1 and plays a negative role in UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis [17]. Since cul4cs exhibited no obvious defect in hypocotyl growth under UV-B [17], we consistently found that YFP-UVR8WT/cul4cs phenocopied YFP-UVR8WT and cul4cs (Figure 6A).. . 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004218.g006. Figure 6. . UVR8W285A and UVR8R338A display constitutive activity in darkness.. (A) Phenotypes and relative hypocotyl length of 4-day-old seedlings of indicated genotypes grown under -UV-B and +UV-B.

We have previously proposed that the UVR8-COP1 interaction mediated by UV-B enables a reorganization of COP1 complexes and eventually results in a functional switch of COP1 from a repressor to a promoter of photomorphogenesis [17]. Both the enhanced photomorphogenesis of YFP-UVR8W285A and YFP-UVR8R338A under -UV-B (Figures 2A, 2B and 2C) and the persistent binding of UVR8W285A and UVR8R338A (Figures 1B and 5C) to COP1 prompted us to examine the development of all the UVR8 variants in darkness. In addition to Col, uvr8-6 and YFP-UVR8WT, YFP-UVR8W233A, YFP-UVR8W233F, YFP-UVR8W285F and YFP-UVR8R286A all showed typical skotomorphogenic responses, demonstrating long hypocotyls, closed cotyledons and apical hooks. In contrast, YFP-UVR8W285A and YFP-UVR8R338A displayed open cotyledons, suggesting that these two UVR8 variants were capable of inducing constitutive photomorphogenesis irrespective of their exposure to light (Figure 6B). We then examined light-regulated gene expression, and found highly accumulated transcripts of CHS, RIBULOSE BISPHOSPHATE CARBOXYLASE SMALL CHAIN 1A (RBCS1A), CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN 3 (CAB3) and ELIP2, in YFP-UVR8W285A and YFP-UVR8R338A (Figure 6C). Though UVR8W233A, UVR8W233F and UVR8R286A had constitutive physical interactions with COP1 in yeast (Figure 1B), their affinity with COP1 in vivo was much weaker than that of UVR8W285A and UVR8R338A (Figure 5C), indicating that conversion of COP1's function might require a threshold level of UVR8-COP1 interaction.. We have also pointed out that in response to UV-B, monomerized UVR8 might sequester COP1 from the CUL4-DDB1 based E3 apparatus [17]. In darkness, compared with YFP-UVR8W285A/uvr8-6 and YFP-UVR8R338A/uvr8-6, YFP-UVR8W285A/cop1-4 and YFP-UVR8R338A/cop1-4 mimicked cop1-4 (Figure 6D), which is consistent with our conclusion that UVR8 functions in a COP1-dependent manner. YFP-UVR8W285A/cul4cs and YFP-UVR8R338A/cul4cs exhibited enhanced constitutive photomorphogenesis with decreased hypocotyl length (Figure 6D). These results indicate that the reduced CUL4 protein abundance might facilitate the release of an increased amount of COP1 from CUL4-DDB1 to allow an improved association between UVR8 and COP1, and in turn achieve a highly switched function of COP1 in promoting photomorphogenesis..
PMC3913338	Results. . A network of interactions among MADS domain proteins. In order to study the organization of interactions between MADS domain proteins in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we assembled a network of interactions of these proteins. In such a network, nodes represent distinct MADS domain proteins and edges represent the potential of two proteins to physically interact, according to published experimental information. We started by including protein-protein interactions found by a set of yeast two-hybrid assays [15]. We also considered interactions obtained through a large-scale study based on yeast three-hybrid analyses [25], as described in Methods. The network was supplemented with information from several other sources that have established interactions between Arabidopsis MADS domain proteins by means of analyzing small sets of proteins [21-23,33,37] (see Table S1 in Additional file 1). Figure 1 shows the resulting non-directed network. From now on we refer to this network as the MADS network.. . Figure 1. . Network of protein-protein interactions among Arabidopsis MADS domain proteins. Each node represents an Arabidopsis MADS domain protein encoded by a different gene. Edges bind pairs of nodes that physically interact.. . . . The MADS network comprises 79 nodes, including four proteins that result from alternative splicing (ABS-2, SEP4-2, AGL74-2 and AGL74-N). There are 312 protein-protein interactions in the network. The most highly connected node (AGL74-N) has 34 interactions, and the median number of interactions per protein is 6.. . . Some connection patterns appear with a frequency higher than expected by chance in the MADS network. Despite a great experimental effort, we still do not know how widespread tetramer formation is in the Arabidopsis MADS domain transcription factor family. As we state in the introduction, diverse sources of evidence suggest that tetramer formation among MADS domain proteins depends on each MADS domain protein binding directly to two other MADS domain proteins in the tetramer through different protein domains. The subgraph schematized in Figure 2a represents such a connection pattern.. . Figure 2. . Subgraphs composed of four nodes. a. Subgraph that represents a connection pattern associated to MADS domain protein heterotetramers. Each node binds two other nodes in this subgraph. b. Subgraphs that include all those interactions in a. Curved edges with both ends on the same node represent interactions between identical copies of a protein. c. Subgraphs that do not include all the interactions in a.. . . . For each of the 50 possible ways of connecting N=4 nodes (Figure 2), we determined how many instances of that subgraph occurred in the MADS network. In order to find out whether the abundance of the different connection patterns in the MADS network is significant, we compared our counts to those of randomized networks that we used as reference. Each of the 104 randomized networks that we built had the same number of nodes, connections and connectivity distribution as the MADS network (see Methods). After correcting for multiple hypotheses testing [38], we found five connection patterns that were significantly more abundant in the MADS network than in the randomized networks (Table 1). In fact, for each of these five connection patterns there was not a single of the 104 sampled random networks with at least the same number of instances of the connection pattern as the MADS network. The subgraph that we expect to be related to tetramers appears among these five subgraphs (second row in Table 1). Moreover, it is noteworthy that, of all the significantly abundant connection patterns in Table 1, only one (first row) does not include all the interactions present in the subgraph in Figure 2a. In sum, four out of five of the overrepresented connection patterns are compatible with the formation of heterotetramers. Taken together, our results suggest that there is a trend to form tetramers in the MADS-domain protein-protein interaction network. We further pursued this hypothesis in several ways.. . Table 1. .

First, we considered all those connection patterns that contain the interactions in the subgraph that is significantly abundant in the MADS network but that is not compatible with tetramer formation (first row in Table 1). In other words, we counted those subgraphs in which nodes have at least the links in that connection pattern (first row in Table 1), but possibly also some other additional links. We found that subgraphs that embed such a pattern are not more abundant than as expected by chance (first row in Table 2). In contrast, subgraphs that include, at least, all the interactions in the tetramer-compatible pattern (Figure 2a,b) are more frequent in the MADS network than in randomized networks (fifth row in Table 2). Moreover, it is noteworthy that connection patterns that embed subgraphs distinct to the subgraph in Figure 2a, but similar in arrangement or number of interactions, are not more abundant in the MADS network than as expected by chance (rows 2-4 in Table 2). From now on, we will refer to connection patterns that incorporate (perhaps not exclusively) the interactions in the subgraph in Figure 2a as tetramer-like subgraphs or connection patterns. Such connection patterns are listed in Figure 2a,b. Remarkably, none of 104 sampled randomized networks had at least as many tetramer-like subgraphs as the MADS network (last row in Table 2).. .

Table shows results for connection patterns that forcefully include some interactions (solid lines) but may or not contain other interactions (dashed lines).. . . Throughout this work we have assumed that most positive results in yeast-three hybrid assays reflect pairwise protein-protein interactions. Consider an assay where proteins X and Z function as bait and prey, respectively, and that produces a positive result only in the presence of a third protein Y. In this case, we assume pairwise interactions between X and Y on the one hand, and between Y and Z, on the other (see Methods). Alternatively, such a positive result could indicate that these proteins bind only in the presence of all three proteins. We have dismissed the latter alternative, as a simplifying assumption. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that more than two thirds (58/84) of the pairwise interactions that we derived from a large scale three-hybrid study [25] were also supported by two-hybrid data in the study by de Folter and collaborators [15]. Moreover, if the formation of higher-order complexes, as those inferred from yeast three-hybrid studies, depended on non-pairwise interactions between a dimer and a third protein there would be specific implications that are not fulfilled. Namely, if the aforementioned hypothetical proteins X and Y form the dimer that binds in a non-pairwise manner to protein Z, we would also recover the interaction between X and Y from yeast two-hybrid studies, but not the interaction between Y and Z. In other words, a scenario where non-pairwise interactions are prevalent in higher-order protein complexes implies that, for most positive yeast three-hybrid results, only one pairwise interaction is also supported by yeast two-hybrid data. In contrast, our assumption predicts that for most positive yeast three-hybrid results, there are two interactions supported by yeast two-hybrid assays. We thus assessed how many of the sets of three proteins that produce a positive yeast three-hybrid in a large-scale study [25] reflect these patterns in the large-scale two-hybrid study [15]. Of the 116 sets of three proteins that yield a three-hybrid positive result, 86 (74.1%) have two interactions also supported by two-hybrid data, consistently with our hypothesis. In contrast, 26 (22.4%) and four (3.4%) have only one or none interactions, respectively, supported by two-hybrid data.. Our observations suggest that most interactions inferred from yeast three-hybrid data are pairwise, as we assumed. Notwithstanding, we addressed whether our observations in Tables 1 and 2 depend on this assumption. We assembled a new network that includes only interactions from the aforementioned two-hybrid study [15]. This network thus contains only interactions confirmed to be pairwise. We compared subgraph counts of this network to that of 104 of randomized networks that preserved the number of nodes, connections, and connectivity distribution. The results are qualitatively the same to those that we obtained from the analysis of the MADS network (compare Tables S2 and S3 in Additional file 1 to Tables 1 and 2, respectively). Thus, the statistically significant abundance of tetramer-like connection patterns in the MADS network does not depend on the assumption that interactions derived from three-hybrid data are pairwise. In conclusion, our results on the analysis of the MADS network are robust to the removal of all the interactions derived from three-hybrid data.. . . Tetramer-like subgraphs are not abundant in interaction networks of the TCP plant protein family. It may be that the abundance of tetramer-like connection patterns is not specific of MADS domain proteins, but rather a general trend in plant protein interaction networks. If this is the case, the abundance of tetramer-like subgraphs would be more easily explained by factors common to the evolution of plant protein interaction networks rather than by functional constraints favoring MADS domain proteins to form tetrameric complexes. Secondly, the observed abundance of tetramer-like connection patterns could be due to the nature of the yeast-based protein-protein interaction assay. In this case, similar trends and distribution of subgraphs are expected in a large-scale yeast n-hybrid data set for another protein family.. To address the above two possibilities, a protein interaction network for another family of plant transcription factors was analyzed. We considered TCP proteins in Arabidopsis. These are transcription factors important for the regulation of different growth processes [35]. We extracted interactions between TCP proteins from a large-scale yeast two-hybrid study [36,39]. The TCP network contains 62 interactions among 20 nodes (Figure 3). We built 104 randomized networks with the same number of nodes, connections and the same degree distribution as the original TCP network, analogously to what we did for the MADS network. We then counted how many times tetramer-like connection patterns featured in the TCP and randomized networks. The TCP network did not show significantly abundant tetramer-like subgraphs, when compared to the randomized networks (Table 3). Our observations on the TCP network are consistent with the hypothesis that the abundance of tetramer-like subgraphs that we observed in the MADS network is not a property of all plant transcription factor interaction networks. Thus, the abundance of such subgraphs may well be a functional constraint associated to MADS domain protein complexes.. . Figure 3. .

The numbers of proteins and interactions in the TCP and MADS networks are so contrasting that one may think that network size could underlie the differences in subgraph abundance that we found between these two networks. This is unlikely, since we compare each network with randomized versions with the same number of nodes, connections, and connectivity distribution. Notwithstanding, we addressed this possibility by sampling randomly 20-node sub-networks from the MADS network, keeping only those sub-networks that had the same connectivity distribution as the TCP network. In that manner, from a sample of more than 106 sets of MADS domain proteins, we obtained 50 sub-networks. These sub-networks contained experimentally validated interactions among MADS domain proteins, but also the same number of nodes and connectivity distribution as the TCP network. The 50 sub-networks taken from the MADS network have an average of 216.22 tetramer-like connection patterns (median =216.5; std. dev. =19.37). In contrast, the 104 randomized networks have a mean number of only 161.1 tetramer-like connection patterns (median =160; std. dev. =22.9). The difference is statistically significant, according to a Mann-Whitney U test (U=11.39; p<2.610-308). In sum, tetramer-like connection patterns are significantly abundant in partitions of the MADS network with the same connectivity distribution as the TCP network, but not in the TCP network.. . . Co-expression is frequent for MADS domain proteins in tetramer-like connection patterns. In order to form functional tetrameric complexes, MADS domain proteins in a tetramer-like connection patterns must be expressed jointly in vivo. To address whether this is usually the case, and also whether there is a difference in the degree of co-expression with proteins in other four-node subgraphs, we considered gene expression data reported in the developmental data set of the AtGenExpress project [40] (see Methods).. Several genes encoding for proteins in the MADS network lack expression data in the AtGenExpress data set. We thus built a new network by discarding such proteins from the MADS network. We call the resulting network the MADS. exp.  network. The MADS. exp.  network contains 54 nodes and 167 interactions. While the original MADS network contains 2751 different sets of proteins in tetramer-like subgraphs, the MADS. exp.  network includes 1351 such sets. Nevertheless, the MADS. exp.  network contains significantly more tetramer-like subgraphs than randomized networks with the same number of nodes, number of interactions, and degree distribution (first row in Table 4). In fact, this result holds after discarding those subgraphs composed of nodes (proteins) whose encoding mRNA is never co-expressed in at least one tissue (second row in Table 4).. . Table 4. . .

Co-expressed tetramer-like subgraphs. 1134. 563.745. 561. 53.9929. 0.539929. <10-4. . . . . We repeated the analyses described in the previous paragraph, but using the At-TAX data base [41], instead of the AtGenExpress data set. The At-TAX database resulted from a whole genome tiling array for Arabidopsis. It contains expression data for more genes, but for fewer tissues, than the AtGenExpress data set. We call the network that resulted after elimination of proteins lacking expression data in this set the MADS. At-TAX.  network. It contains 74 nodes and 254 edges. This network also has a significant abundance of tetramer-like connection patterns, when compared to randomized networks with the same connectivity distribution. Again, this result holds after dismissing those subgraphs including proteins whose encoding mRNA never coincides in at least one tissue. Despite the At-TAX database contains expression data for more genes encoding MADS domain proteins, it is less suitable than the AtGenExpress data set for the analysis of co-expression of different proteins. Given that the At-TAX database includes information for only ten different wild-type plant tissues, there are many pairs of co-expression false negatives. Consider, for instance, those sets of four proteins connected according to a tetramer-like connection pattern. The MADS. exp.  network contains 1351 such sets and the MADS. At-TAX.  contains 1849 of them. However, after dismissing those sets where evidence of co-expression is lacking, the MADS. exp.  network contains 1134 but the MADS. At-TAX.  includes only 574 of them. Thus, we performed the remaining analyses only using the AtGenExpress data set and the MADS. exp.  network.. As mentioned above, we found in our analysis of the MADS. exp.  network that the mRNA encoding for proteins in most tetramer-like subgraphs is co-expressed in at least one Arabidopsis tissue: Of 1351 4-protein sets in tetramer-like subgraphs, the four genes encoding for the proteins of only 217 such sets are never co-expressed at the same time, based on the AtGenExpress data. However, for each of the remaining 1134 sets, the genes encoding the four constituent proteins are co-expressed in one or more tissues (Table 4 and Figure 4). The list with these 1134 protein sets is presented in Additional file 2, and we refer to each of such sets as a prospective tetramer. Thus, for proteins in tetramer-like subgraphs, the ratio of jointly expressed encoding genes (in at least one tissue) versus never co-expressed encoding genes is 5.23:1 (1134:217). The same ratio but for four-node subgraphs that are not tetramer-like is less than half as low (2.31:1 ; 4388:1896). The difference is statistically significant: A Pearsons chi2 test rejects the null hypothesis that there is no association between joint expression of proteins (in at least one tissue) and formation of tetramer-like connection patterns (chi2=110.6; df=1; p=7.2510-26). Thus, genes encoding for proteins in tetramer-like subgraphs are more likely to be co-expressed than genes encoding for proteins in other subgraphs.. . Figure 4. . Joint expression of genes encoding for proteins in tetramer-like subgraphs. The genes that encode for the four proteins in most tetramer-like subgraphs are expressed jointly in one or more Arabidopsis tissues.. . . . As a means of illustrating how large the differences in joint expression are between those genes encoding for proteins in tetramer-like subgraphs and those encoding for proteins in other subgraphs, we collected the data shown in Figure 5. We first assessed, for the 1351 protein sets in tetramer-like connection patterns, the fraction of sets where the encoding genes are co-expressed in at least one tissue. This fraction equals 0.84 (1134/1351). We then picked 104 samples, each composed of 1351 subgraphs taken randomly from the 7635 4-node subgraphs in the MADS. exp.  network. For each such sample, we determined the fraction of sets where all the four protein-encoding genes are co-expressed in one or more tissues. Joint expression is more frequent in tetramer-like subgraphs than in random subgraphs in the MADS. exp.  network. In fact, none of the 104 samples had a fraction of co-expression as high as that of tetramer-like subgraphs (p<10-4).. . Figure 5. . The fraction of co-expression in the MADSexp network is higher for tetramer-like subgraphs than for random ensembles of subgraphs. We define the fraction of co-expression as the proportion of subgraphs composed of proteins whose genes are expressed jointly in at least one tissue. The black dot indicates the fraction of co-expression for tetramer-like subgraphs (0.84). The histogram represents the frequency distribution of the fraction of co-expression for a sample of 104 ensembles, each composed of 1351 4-node subgraphs picked randomly from the MADSexp network.. . . . Additional evidence suggests that, in terms of MADS-box gene expression, tetramer-like connection patterns are distinct from other subgraphs. We considered the distribution of all the connected 4-node subgraphs in the MADS. exp.  network expressed in n tissues, distinguishing between those sets of proteins in tetramer-like subgraphs and those in non-tetramer-like subgraphs. Figure 6 evidences that the distribution of tetramer-like subgraphs has a broader right tail. Indeed, a Mann-Whitney U test reveals that there are significant differences in the number of tissues where proteins in tetramer-like subgraphs or in other subgraphs are jointly expressed (U=148.56, p<2.610-308). In sum, it is easier to find a set of four MADS domain proteins whose genes are co-expressed in many tissues if the proteins are linked in a tetramer-like connection pattern than when linked in any other manner.. . Figure 6. . Distributions of protein sets co-expressed in n tissues. The distribution for protein sets in tetramer-like subgraphs has a broader tail than that of the distribution associated to subgraphs that are not tetramer-like.. . . . Recent experimental research suggests that SEP1-3 proteins have an important role facilitating the formation of MADS domain protein tetramers [20,21,25]. The composition of the list of prospective tetramers supports the prominence of these proteins for the assembly of tetrameric complexes: SEP1-3 proteins appear 840 times in the list of prospective tetramers. While SEP3 and SEP1 appear each 385 times, SEP2 appears only 70 times. It is noteworthy that other MADS domain proteins also occur many times in the list of prospective tetramers. AGL21 appears 376 times, SOC1 457 times, AGL6 290 times and AGL24 278 times. SEP1-3 proteins perform their functions in the floral meristem [42]. It may well be that other proteins that appear recurrently in the list of prospective tetramers play a SEP-like role in the formation of tetramers outside the flower.. . . Proteins in prospective tetramers are mostly MIKC MADS domain proteins. Until now, all experimentally validated MADS domain protein tetramers consist exclusively of proteins in the MIKC clade [20-24]. The K domain appears exclusively in MIKC proteins [4,12] and, importantly, it has been implicated in several protein-protein interactions [14,20,21,33,34,43]. For these reasons, it may well be that the formation of MADS domain protein tetramers occurs mainly for MIKC proteins. We thus addressed whether this could be the case.. We found that, of all the 2751 tetramer-like connection patterns that the MADS network contains, 1397 contain only MIKC proteins and 1354 contain at least one non-MIKC protein. Of the latter, 773 comprise a mixture of MIKC and non-MIKC proteins, and the remaining 581 contain non-MIKC proteins exclusively. Remarkably, the story is very different when we analyze the protein sets in the list of prospective tetramers, which includes the 1134 protein sets in tetramer-like subgraphs that are expressed jointly in at least one tissue. In this case, there are 1127 protein sets that consist purely of MIKC proteins, but only seven sets with at least one non-MIKC protein (Table 5). Indeed, among proteins in tetramer-like subgraphs, there is a clear association between MIKC-only sets and joint expression, according to a Pearsons chi2 test (chi2=1823.3; df=1; p<3.710-235).. .

Although our results support the formation of functional tetramers for MIKC proteins but not for non-MIKC proteins, two confounding factors must be first taken into account. The first is that the AtGenExpress data set includes expression data for a larger fraction of MIKC proteins when compared to non-MIKC proteins. The MADS network comprises 35 MIKC proteins and 44 non-MIKC proteins. In contrast, the MADS. exp.  network, in which we discarded proteins encoded by genes lacking expression data, includes 32 MIKC but only 23 non-MIKC proteins. We thus performed an additional analysis to control for this factor. In this analysis, we first sampled randomly 15 non-MIKC and 15 MIKC proteins from the MADS. exp.  network. The AtGenExpress data set contained expression information for all 30 genes encoding for such proteins. We next counted the number of sets of four of these 30 proteins where: i) the four proteins interacted according to a tetramer-like connection pattern, and ii) the genes encoding for such four proteins were co-expressed in at least one tissue. We performed 104 independent samplings. Even though the number of MIKC and non-MIKC proteins was the same in each sample, we found immense differences in the number of MIKC and non-MIKC prospective tetramers. On average, in each sample we found 0.6 prospective tetramers composed exclusively of non-MIKC proteins (median =0, std. dev. =0.94). In contrast, we found a mean number of 49.1 prospective tetramers comprising only MIKC proteins (median =37, std. dev. =44.14). We also counted prospective tetramers comprising both MIKC and non-MIKC. In this case we found only an average of 0.36 (median =0, std. dev. = 0.64). The difference between the abundance of MIKC-only and non-MIKC-only prospective tetramers is highly significant, according to a Mann-Whitney U test (U=117.5; p<2.610-308).. A second factor that may be confounding is that MIKC proteins tend to have a significantly broader mRNA expression pattern than non-MIKC proteins. According to AtGenExpress data, the mRNA of MIKC proteins in the MADS. exp.  network is found in a mean number of 29.5 tissues (median =27, std. dev. =18.6). In comparison, there is expression of the mRNA of non-MIKC proteins in an average of 10.9 tissues (median =5, std. dev. =17.1). The difference is statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U=4.2; p=1.1510-5). An open possibility is that we find few non-MIKC proteins in our list of prospective tetramers only because these proteins have narrow expression patterns, thus making it more unlikely that four such proteins coincide in at least one tissue. Nevertheless, if non-MIKC proteins have an important role in the formation of functional tetramers, we expect that it will be easier to find sets of four co-expressed non-MIKC proteins if they take part in a tetramer-like subgraph than when they are connected in any other manner. We went back to the MADS. exp.  network and counted the number of four-node connection patterns comprising only non-MIKC proteins. We distinguished between tetramer-like subgraphs and all other subgraphs, on the one hand, and between co-expression in at least one tissue and no co-expression, on the other hand (Table 6). A Pearsons chi2 test does not allow us to reject the null hypothesis that a tetramer-like connection pattern and joint expression of encoding genes are not associated (chi2=0.37, df =1, p=0.54). Thus, it is not easier to find sets of non-MIKC proteins with joint expression of their encoding genes when they are connected according to a tetramer-like subgraph.. . Table 6. .

Taken together, the results presented in this section do not support that non-MIKC proteins have an important role in the formation of functional tetramers. Rather, they support that MIKC proteins are predominantly, perhaps exclusively, involved in the formation of MADS domain protein tetramers.. . . Retrodiction of experimental results. Experimental studies have found several examples of MADS domain proteins that assemble into functional tetramers (see Table S4 in Additional file 1). We checked whether those experimentally supported tetramers appear in our list of prospective tetramers (Additional file 2).. Based on genetic data Gregis et al. infer that the proteins AP1, AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24), SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and CAULIFLOWER (CAL) participate in a functional tetramer [44]. Indeed, this set of proteins appears in our list of prospective tetramers, thus supporting that this set of proteins may build a functional tetramer. The story is not as straightforward for the remaining experimentally-supported tetramers for the following reasons: First, several of these tetramers include the protein APETALA3 (AP3). In the data sets from which we built our network, AP3 only interacts with PISTILLATA (PI). Thus, in our study, AP3 can not take part in a tetramer-like subgraph, defined by each node having two interactions with different proteins. Second, one tetramer included a protein, AGAMOUS-LIKE 30 (AGL30), that has no interactions in our data set. Third, a protein appears twice in a validated tetramer. Thus, a three-node subgraph would represent one such tetramer. This occurs for AG, AP1 and SEP3. The latter is the protein that appears in most of the validated tetramers.. In order to partially overcome the limitations mentioned in the previous paragraph, we considered that SEP1 is a very close paralogue of SEP3 [4,5]. Moreover, SEP1 and SEP3 are highly redundant [42], and they share many of the proteins with which they interact [15,25]. Therefore, we assumed that SEP1 could replace one SEP3 instance in a tetramer. It is noteworthy that for all cases where the only limitation was that SEP3 appeared twice in a validated tetramer, we found a match in the list of prospective tetramers where SEP1 replaced one of the SEP3 instances.. Loss of function mutations of several different genes that encode for MADS domain proteins do not display obvious phenotypic alterations. The reason is that they are redundant with other MADS domain proteins so that phenotypic effects appear only in multiple mutant combinations [8]. Identification of redundant genes may not be easy. Thus, we attempted to retrodict experimentally validated combinations of redundant genes as a means to evaluate the potential usefulness of our results as an aid for the design of new experiments.. First we searched in our list of prospective tetramers for all those that included a protein of our interest, X. For one of the X-including prospective tetramers, e.g. X-A-B-C, we scanned again the whole list of prospective tetramers to identify all those protein sets that share all proteins with the exception of X. In other words, we identified sets Y-A-B-C, Z-A-B-C, and so on. We preserved each such set only if the gene encoding for the protein that replaced X was co-expressed, in at least one tissue, with those genes of all four proteins in the original X-including prospective tetramer. Gene expression was determined from microarray expression data [40] (see Methods). We repeated the above for each of the remaining X-including prospective tetramers. We expected that proteins that replaced X most often in the prospective tetramers were more likely to be redundant with X. Indeed, we found that this was the case, as we describe below.. Pelaz and collaborators found that the SEP1-3 proteins are highly redundant [42]. After following the algorithm described in the preceding paragraph, we found that SEP3 most often replaces SEP1 in prospective tetramers, both SEP1 and SEP3 substitute SEP2 more frequently, and SEP1 takes the place of SEP3 with greatest probability. Another relevant example concerns the protein CAL. Loss of function cal mutants do not display an obvious phenotype, unless combined with the ap1 mutation [45]. In our analysis, there are three proteins that replace CAL most often in the same number of prospective tetramers: AP1, AGL6, and SEP1. Thus, also in this case we could identify the protein, AP1, that substitutes for the function of CAL. To our knowledge, there is no experimental evidence that loss of function agl6 or sep1 mutations could enhance the cal phenotype, but this remains as an open possibility and a prediction derived from our analyses. Finally, the SHATTERPROOF1/2 (SHP1/2) proteins are also redundant [46]. Again, SHP2 is the protein that substitutes SHP1 most times in our list of prospective tetramers. These results support that our list of prospective tetramers and simple algorithms as that described above may be of value to infer relationships among MADS domain proteins and design experiments accordingly.. . . Homodimers in the formation of tetramers. So far, we have addressed how the patterns of interactions within sets of four different proteins may be indicative of MADS-domain protein heterotetramers. Hence, our analyses have left out of the picture those tetramers that incorporate two copies of the same protein. Our method, based on the analysis of pairwise interaction patterns, is unable to identify some of such tetramers. Consider for instance a hypothetical protein A that forms two kinds of dimers, one with protein B and other with protein C. The A molecule in the A-B dimer binds C in the A-C dimer, and the A molecule in the A-C dimer binds B in the other dimer to form a tetramer. In our network we would only observe interactions between A and B and between A and C (B-A-C), which is a connection pattern that appears in all non-disjoint 3 node sets. This argument is even stronger when we consider a tetramer in which two A-B dimers form a tetramer through interactions between A and B molecules in different dimers. Here, we would be unable to distinguish the interaction pattern associated to this tetramer (A-B) from any pairwise interaction in our network. Thus, our method is clearly not useful to associate a connection pattern to some of the possible tetramers that include two or more copies of a single protein. However, there are some cases where this association can be accomplished. These cases involve tetramers that incorporate homodimers.. As assumed for heterotetramers, we expect that each protein molecule in a tetramer that incorporates homodimers also binds two other protein molecules. The only difference to heterotetramers is that one such interaction must occur between the identical protein molecules that form the homodimer. Consider first a tetramer that contains a single homodimer. The corresponding 3-node subgraph is a triangle in which each node binds the other two nodes, and at least one node has a self interaction. For brevity, we will refer to 3-node connection patterns that embed this subgraph as three-node tetramer patterns (3NTP). Now consider a tetramer that incorporates two different homodimers. In this case, the subgraph corresponds to a pair of interacting nodes, each with self-interactions. We will call these subgraphs two-node tetramer patterns (2NTP). Subgraphs that include either of these interaction patterns are not significantly abundant in the MADS network when compared to randomized networks with the same connectivity distribution. However, it must be taken into account that few MADS domain proteins self-interact. Indeed, self-interactions occur significantly less often in the MADS network (6 self-interactions) than in randomized networks (a median of 10 self-interactions) (p=0.045). It is thus relevant comparing the counts of these subgraphs in the MADS network to those in randomized networks with the same number of self-interactions as the MADS network. In this case, the number of occurrences of 2NTPs and 3NTPs is significantly higher in the MADS network. Out of 104 randomized networks with the same connectivity distribution and the same number of nodes, interactions and self-interactions as the MADS network, there are only two that have as many 2NTPs as the MADS network (p=0.0002) and none with as many 3NTPs as the MADS network (p<10-4). While the MADS network has 14 and 235 2NTPs and 3NTPs, respectively, randomized networks have a median of 8 2NTPs and 160 3NTPs. Hence, when we control for the occurrence of self-interactions, subgraphs associated to homodimer-including tetramers are overrepresented in the MADS network.. We also evaluated whether the mRNA coding for proteins in homodimer-including tetramers is co-expressed more often than for proteins in other subgraphs. The MADS. exp.  network contains 14 2NTPs, all of which have proteins with jointly expressed mRNA in at least one tissue. In contrast, there are 147 two-node subgraphs that are not 2NTPs in the MADS network, but only for 131 of them the pair of proteins are jointly expressed, as inferred from RNA expression patterns. In other words, while proteins in 100% (14/14) 2NTPs are jointly expressed, proteins in only 89% (131/147) of non-2NTPs are co-expressed. The difference is not statistically significant according to a Pearsons chi2 test (chi2=1.69; df=1; p=0.193). However, this lack of significance may not be conclusive because of the low number of 2NTPs in the MADS network.. As for 3NTPs, there are 229 in the MADS network, and 213 of them are composed of proteins with mRNA co-expressed in one or more tissues. At the same time, the MADS network has 922 non-3NTP 3-node subgraphs, but only 752 of them are jointly expressed. Hence, the proteins in 93% of 3NTPs are co-expressed in at least one tissue, while proteins in only 81% (752/922) of non-3NTPs are expressed jointly. Indeed, there is a significant statistical association between joint expression and 3NTPs (chi2=17.75; df=1; p=2.510-5)..
PMC4283998	Results. . Morphological analysis of A. thaliana flower development. Flowers from a total of 14 time-points comprising developmental stages ranging from floral initiation to fruit formation (see Table 1) were harvested for morphological analysis by photography, LM, SEM and micro-CT (see Fig.1). In the A. thaliana pAP1::AP1-GR ap1-1 cal-5 mutant that was used for analysis, natural flower development is arrested at stage 1 according to Smyth etal. (1990) and Mller (1961) (see day 0 in Fig.1 and Table 1). At this stage, the primordial floral apex is differentiated. Application of dexamethasone initiates the subsequent steps of floral development. A detailed comparison of the developmental phases of the mutant with the wild-type can be found in Table 1. Each developmental stage of the mutant was assigned to a corresponding stage of A.thaliana wild-type flowers described by Smyth etal. (1990) and Mller (1961), based on a comparison of LM, SEM and micro-CT data.. Three major phases of flower/fruit development can be identified. During the first phase of flower development (days 0-16; preanthetic), all floral organs are established in the usual order of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. The four sepal primordia arise and gradually cover the young inner organs (Fig.1; day 6). The petal primordia grow very slowly or - more commonly - are arrested in their development in the mutant, while the stamen primordia grow relatively fast. The anthers of the four long stamens develop first (Fig.1; day 6). Around days 18-20, the filaments of the four long stamens elongate considerably more than those of the two short ones (Table 1). Pollen tetrads are visible between days 8 and 10 (Fig. S1A). The two-carpellate gynoecium is initiated last, but is soon overtopping the stamens (Fig.1; day 14). Initially, the gynoecium is open at its distal end (day 6 to day 12), and the postgenital closure of the carpels is established c. day 14. Finally, a short style with a tapering apex is formed. This is also the time when the ovules are almost mature and the stigmatic papillae develop (day 16).. The second phase of flower development, anthesis, occurs at c. day 18. During this transition phase, the stigmatic papillae become fully developed and receptive. The pollen tube transmitting tissue within the short style (stained purple-red in the LM picture in Fig.1; day 18) is ready for guiding the pollen tubes to the ovules. The latter are located on parietal placentae in the two locules, which are divided by a false septum (Fig. S1C-F). During this developmental stage, the filaments reach their final length and bear the dehiscing anthers that release their fully developed pollen grains (Fig. S1C,D).. After pollination and fertilization, the flower passes into a third phase which corresponds to fruit and seed development. The perianth and androecium wither, and eventually fall off on day 22. The siliques enlarge rapidly from day 20 to day 22, but more slowly from day 22 to day 27 (see Table 1 and next section). The developing dicotyledonous embryo can be seen soon after day 20. An embryo of the late heart stage is shown in the LM picture in Fig.1 (day 27). The very small cells of the embryo stain intensively with toluidine blue, which indicates that the meristematic tissue is highly active.. . . Morphometric analysis of flower development using micro-CT and multivariate statistics. To obtain a spatial impression and direct access to the morphometric parameters of the flower, a micro-CT system was used to produce 3D models of different developmental stages (Fig.1).The reconstructed 3D models of the flowers allow for the dissection of the organs into 2D virtual sections (Fig.2). For morphometric analysis, ten characteristic parameters which displayed significant change throughout flower development were identified: (1) flower length; (2) gynoecium length; (3) gynoecium width in the plane of the septum; (4) gynoecium width in the dorsiventral plane of the carpels; (5) anther length; (6) anther width; and (7) filament length of long and short stamens, respectively. These parameters were measured in the 2D virtual sections (Fig.2).. Flower length was the only parameter that could be measured throughout all developmental stages. In early stages, flower length is defined as the length of the floral apex, and in older stages as the distance between the gynoecium tip and the lowermost point of sepal attachment along the floral axis. Thus, tomographic longitudinal sections in the septal plane of the gynoecium, revealing the level of attachment of the two lower sepals (adaxial and abaxial), were chosen for all measurements of flower length (Fig.2c).. To measure the gynoecium parameters, a line (green), indicating the position of the corresponding x-plane, was placed onto the cross-section of the ovary septum, and an orthogonal second line (red), indicating the corresponding y-plane, was placed along the dorsiventral plane of the gynoecium (Fig.2a). The gynoecium length and width (dorsiventral plane) were measured in the y-plane (Fig.2b). In the x-plane, the gynoecium width (septum) and length were measured (Fig.2c).. For measurement of the androecium parameters (anther and filament lengths), either the longitudinal images taken for the entire flower (Fig.2c) or, in older stages or when stamens were bent, longitudinal and transverse virtual sections of individual anthers were used. While measuring the filament length it was taken into account that the filament of A.thaliana is basifixed to the relatively short connective of the latrorse anthers. As far as possible, a discrimination between long and short stamens was made. The anther width is defined as the furthest distance from the two pairs of pollen sacs in cross-sectional view (Fig.2a).. All the data for the developmental parameters are summarized in Table 1 and visualized in a bar plot in Fig.3. On day 0, the primary floral apex was already present. Up to day 4, the continuously increasing flower length was the only parameter that could be measured because the individual flower organs were not yet differentiated. Floral organ initiation took place from day 2 onwards, when the sepal primordia appeared on the floral apex. From day 6 until day 20, all ten parameters were measured. Gynoecium width increased gradually, while gynoecium length grew exponentially until day 20 and nearly tripled between day 20 and day 22, followed by further gradual growth. The stamens were distinguishable from day 6 to day 20. The anthers tripled their width and length from day 6 to day 8. By contrast, the filaments developed and lengthened only slowly from day 8 onwards, followed by rapid, c. 3-fold growth just before anthesis on day 18. After anthesis, on day 22 the stamens abscised (see also Fig. S1G).. . Fig 3. . Morphometric data for Arabidopsis thalianapAP1::AP1-GR ap1-1 cal-5 flower development and silique formation measured with micro computed tomography (micro-CT). For correspondence of harvesting days and developmental stages, replicate measurements and coefficients of variation, see Table 1.. . . . Of the 70 measured morphometric mean values listed in Table 1, the vast majority had a coefficient of variation below 15%. Almost all of them were below 25%, which lies within the normal range of biological variation (Table 1).. Floral development is a multivariate process defined by many different parameters. It is not possible to intuitively recognize the developmental trajectory derived from the multiple covariances of all parameters just by looking at the listed parameter table. Therefore, we applied multivariate statistical analysis which takes all parameters and their covariance or correlation into account for the explorative visualization of the developmental trajectory (Weckwerth, 2008). One of the main tools for this explorative analysis is principal components analysis (PCA). Using the morphometric parameters from Table 1 as variables, the different stages of flower development were visualized by PCA. PCA revealed the ontogenetic trajectory of flower and fruit development by plotting all replicate micro-CT analyses based on their covariance into a new 3D coordinate system spanned by the principal components PC1, PC2 and PC3 (Fig. 4, the grey arrow illustrates the developmental trajectory). For a better interpretation of the developmental trajectory, different phases of development were assigned to the PCA trajectory (three main phases: preanthetic flower, anthesis and fruit/seed; four subphases within the phase of preanthetic flower). The loadings of the PCA, which are a measure of the importance of variables for the visible trajectory (Weckwerth, 2008), can be found in Table S2. In the following, metabolite dynamics during development and the combined morphometric-metabolic trajectory are described.. . Fig 4. .

Each dot represents a biological replicate from the harvesting day indicated in the key. For correspondence of harvesting day and developmental stage, see Table 1. The three phases of preanthetic flower, anthesis and fruit/seed development are distinguishable.. . . . . . Metabolomic analysis of A. thaliana flower development. To compare the morphological data during flower development with metabolic changes, metabolites for all time-points from day 0 to day 27 were measured. More than 50 compounds could be identified and quantified by GC-MS (Table S3). The composition of sugars, organic and amino acids and other metabolites showed significant changes during flower and silique development (Fig.5). In the following, changes in the concentrations of selected metabolites are described. Concentrations of the sugar sucrose and the sugar alcohol inositol were relatively high during early development and then decreased, while at the same time fructose and glucose displayed low concentrations until day 16, and then a rapid increase soon after. The concentration of the sugar acid threonic acid was initially low but rose later in development, showing a peak at day 22. Analysis of the organic acids revealed that the concentration of citric acid was high early in development but decreased later. Malic acid, succinic acid and fumaric acid displayed constantly increasing concentrations over time. The amino acids alanine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid displayed high initial concentrations, but decreased thereafter. The glycine concentration displayed a peak during anthesis. The proline concentration was initially low but increased until day 20.. . Fig 5. . Metabolite profiles of Arabidopsis thaliana pAP1::AP1-GR ap1-1 cal-5 flower samples. Samples were taken every 2 d over 27 d from induction of flower development by dexamethasone (day 0) to silique formation. Error bars showSD; n=3-5 biological replicates. Shown are selected metabolites and their relative changes in concentration during flower development. For further details, see text. The full data set is available in Supporting Information Table S3. au, arbitrary units.. . . . . . Integration of metabolic and morphometric data during flower development - correlation of specific metabolites with their corresponding developmental stages. The mean values of the biological replicates for each developmental stage were used to integrate metabolite and morphometric data on flower development. Each data set was uploaded and normalized using the range-scaling function implemented in covain (Sun & Weckwerth, 2012) to allow the comparison of metabolite and morphometric data. Data alignment of the two data sets was then performed using an alignment function in covain (Sun & Weckwerth, 2012), resulting in an integrative data matrix comprising normalized metabolite concentrations and morphometric parameters of flower development. The data were analysed using the PCA function of covain (Fig.6). Based on the covariance of morphometric and metabolic parameters, the ontogenetic trajectory of flower development becomes visible by plotting PC1 and PC2. The association of morphometric and metabolite data is revealed by the loadings of PC1 and PC2 (Weckwerth, 2008). In Fig. S2 and Table S2 the loadings are shown. Gynoecium and anther parameters had a strong influence on the trajectory, as well as the sugars fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol, the amino acids glutamic acid and glutamine, and the organic acids malate and citrate. The morphometric and metabolite parameters were further analysed by bi-clustering analysis using covain (Fig.7). Two major clusters were observed: all metabolites and morphometric parameters taken from the preanthetic flower samples (days 0-16) grouped together and were further separated into three subclusters (days 0-2, day 4 and days 6-16); the other cluster was split into two subgroups comprising days 18-20, centred on anthesis, and days 22-27, during fruit/seed development. Altogether four phases could be observed (phase I: days 0-4; phase II: days 6-16; phase III: days18-20, and phase IV: days 22-27). On the basis of this clustering analysis, metabolites that were significantly associated with different developmental stages were identified. Phase I was associated with the amino acids alanine, glutamine, valine and aspartate as well as organic acids such as citrate and components of lipid and membrane metabolism, namely glycerol-3-phosphate, glycolate and ethanolamine. At the same time, hexoses stayed at relatively low concentrations. Transitional medium concentrations of inositol and sucrose connected phase I with phase II before they decreased significantly, while glucose and fructose concentrations increased. On the morphometric side, phase II was characterized by the growth of the anthers and subsequently, at day 14, by an increase of gynoecium width and length. The proline concentration increased from day 14 to day 20, thereby bridging phases II and III, and peaked at day 20, before decreasing again. Days 14 and 16 marked the transition to phase III and were characterized by pronounced morphometric changes (growth of anthers) and slightly increased concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate. Another metabolite associated with this development was malate, whose concentration slightly increased up to day 16 and peaked at day 20. Day 22 bridged anthesis and fruit development and was characterized by higher concentrations of the organic acids fumarate, alpha-hydroxy-glutarate and threonate. Phase IV corresponded to fruit development and showed high concentrations of hexoses. Concomitantly, the gynoecium enlarged rapidly.. . Fig 6. . Principal components analysis of the combined metabolomic and morphometric data matrix of Arabidopsis thaliana pAP1::AP1-GR ap1-1 cal-5. Mean values for metabolite data as well as morphometric data from micro computed tomography (micro-CT) measurements were transformed, aligned and combined into one data matrix using covain (Sun & Weckwerth, 2012). This integrative data matrix was analysed by principal components analysis (PCA) using covain. PCA revealed the integrative molecular and morphometric ontogenetic trajectory of A. thaliana flower development and silique formation, shown as a grey line. Every point on this trajectory represents the combined and transformed vector of metabolite and morphometric mean values of one developmental stage and is labelled with the corresponding day. For correspondence of harvesting day and developmental stage, see Table 1. To exemplify the different stages of development, pictures of micro-CT measurements have been added.

Integrative bi-clustering analysis of variables (metabolites and morphometric parameters) versus samples (harvesting time-points in days) corresponding to specific developmental flower stages of Arabidopsis thaliana pAP1::AP1-GR ap1-1 cal-5 (see Table 1). The developmental stages are clustered into the three major clusters and four subphases as discussed in the text. In the vertical cluster A, early developmental stages are associated with high concentrations of certain metabolites, such as sucrose, glutamine and asparagine. In cluster B, late development is associated with higher concentrations of a different set of metabolites, including proline, glucose and fructose (for more details see the Discussion section). Bi-clustering was performed with covain (Sun & Weckwerth, 2012) and uses average linkage of Euclidean distance between groups as the metric. The colour scale is based on standardized values..
PMC4949643	Results. . AUX1/LAX genes show dynamic expression patterns during early leaf development. Previous analyses have reported that AUX1, LAX1 and LAX2 are expressed in the shoot apex, whereas LAX3 is not expressed in aerial tissue (Bainbridge etal., 2008). To provide a more detailed analysis of these expression patterns, we used transgenic Arabidopsis Col-0 plants expressing promoter-GUS constructs to document the temporal and spatial pattern of AUX1/LAX gene expression throughout leaf development. Focusing first on LAX1 expression (Figure1a,e,i), the GUS reporter signal was initially apparent in a group of cells at the tip of the leaf. As development proceeded, points of LAX1 expression were observed along the flanks of the leaf in an approximately symmetrical pattern just proximal to the mid-point of the proximal/distal axis, indicating the tips of the presumptive serration outgrowth (Figure1e). At later stages, new points of LAX1 expression appeared along the leaf margin proximal to the original sites of LAX1 expression, again indicating presumptive sites of serration (Figure1i). In addition to expression at points along the margin, signal was also often (but not always) observed towards the base of the leaf in internal positions. With respect to LAX2 expression (Figure2b,f,j), GUS activity was initially restricted to internal tissue towards the distal region of the primordium in a complex pattern. As the leaf developed, the network of cells expressing the LAX2 reporter shifted towards the base of the leaf, with the lower boundary of expression being approximately at a line defined by the most proximal points of LAX1 expression (Figure1f). LAX2 expression was always excluded from the outer cell layers, and gradually became restricted to a network resembling part of the differentiating vascular system (Figure1j). LAX3 expression was not detectable in leaf tissue (Bainbridge etal., 2008). AUX1 expression has previously been reported to be restricted to the meristem epidermis and margin of the emerging leaf primordia (Reinhardt etal., 2003; Heisler and Jonsson, 2006), and our analysis of an AUX1 promoter reporter gene construct broadly confirmed this expression pattern throughout the stages of leaf development (Figure1c,g,k). At the earliest stages of development, some reporter gene expression was observed in the sub-marginal cells, but we cannot exclude the possibility of some signal diffusion in these small samples. The synthetic DR5 promoter construct has been widely used as a reporter of auxin signaling (Ulmasov etal., 1997; Sabatini etal., 1999), and analysis of plants transformed with a DR5::GUS construct indicated that, at an early stage of development, signal was apparent at the leaf tip and two equidistant points on the margin, as well as in internal strands in the distal region (Figure1d) (Mattsson etal., 2003). At later stages of development, ProDR5:GUS signal became apparent both at points along the leaf margin, indicative of presumptive outgrowth, and in a network within the leaf reminiscent of regions of presumptive vascular differentiation (Figure1h,l) (Scarpella etal., 2006; Wenzel etal., 2007).. . Figure 1. . . AUX1/LAX genes show dynamic patterns of expression during early leaf development.. Expression patterns observed in ProLAX. 1:GUS (a,e,i), ProLAX. 2:GUS (b,f,j), ProAUX. 1:GUS (c,g,k) and ProDR. 5:GUS (d,h,l) transgenic lines. Patterns are shown for leaf5, which was removed at an early stage of development before overt initiation of serration (a-d), at a stage when the first serration is initiated (e-h), and at a later stage when the first serration is clearly formed (i-l). The GUS signal is blue. Scale bars=50mum (a-d), 100mum (e-h) and 200mum (i-l).. . . . . Figure 2. . Mutation of three auxin importers is required for altered serration growth.. (a-i) Silhouettes of exemplar leaf 5 at an early stage of leaf development when serration is just initiating in WT primordia (a-c), at a mid-stage of development when the first serration has clearly formed in WT (d-f), and at a late stage of development when multiple serrations have formed (g-i). Leaf shapes are shown for WT (a,d,g), aux1/lax1/lax2 (b,e,h) and quadruple (quad) mutant plants (c,f,i). Scale bars=50mum (a-c), 200mum (d-f) and 500mum (g-i).. (j,k) Quantitative analysis of compactness (j) and bending energy (k) are shown for early-, mid- and late-stage leaves dissected from WT and aux1/lax1/lax2 plants. ANOVA using a Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that the samples were statistically significantly different for both parameters at P<0.01 (compactness) and P<0.05 (bending energy) (n=6). Subsequent pairwise Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests for each developmental stage indicated that mid- and late-stage aux1/lax1/lax2 samples were statistically significantly different for compactness compared with their WT counterparts at P<0.05 (indicated by an asterisk), and late-stage aux1/lax1/lax2 samples were statistically significantly different for bending energy compared with their WT counterpart at P<0.05 (indicated by an asterisk).. . . . . . Combined loss of three auxin importer genes leads to a delay in leaf serration. To investigate the effect of loss of AUX1/LAX gene function on leaf shape, we analysed a series of leaves at various developmental stages from a range of single, double, triple and quadruple aux1/lax mutants (Bainbridge etal., 2008; Peret etal., 2012). A phenotype was only observed in the triple mutant aux1/lax1/lax2 and the quadruple (quad) mutant in which all four aux1/lax genes were mutated (Figure2). In WT leaves, the early primordium had a relatively smooth margin with slight undulations towards the base (Figure2a). Subsequently, overt serration occurred at positions towards the leaf base (Figure2d). As development proceeded, serrations arose in more proximal positions (Figure2g); however, the higher relative growth rate of the main body of the leaf compared to the serrations meant that these outgrowths were not as pronounced in the mature leaf as in earlier stages of leaf development, as previously described (Kuwabara etal., 2011). In the aux1/lax1/lax2 mutants, serrations were not visible at early leaf stages (Figure2b,e) but were apparent during later stages (Figure2h). These serrations formed in an appropriate position (i.e. towards the base of the leaf), but differential growth was limited so the serrations were never as pronounced as those observed in WT leaves. Similarly, quad mutants showed a lack of overt serration during early primordium development (Figure2c,f) but serrations were apparent at later stages (Figure2i), although again these were never as pronounced as in the WT and the overall leaf shape tended not to be as symmetrical as in WT. In contrast, the leaf margins of aux1/lax1, aux1/lax3 and aux1/lax2 double mutants mutants were indistinguishable from those of the WT at all developmental stages (FigureS1). The growth rate of the aux1/lax1/lax2 and quad leaves was slower than for WT or single or double mutant combinations. To allow a quantitative comparison of leaf shape during development in the various genetic backgrounds, we used LEAFPROCESSOR software (Backhaus etal., 2010) to analyse leaf profiles normalized for size differences. Our previous work had indicated that two parameters are especially useful for discriminating 2D leaf shape in different genetic backgrounds: compactness (a measure of the ratio of circumference to area) and bending energy (a measure of integrated curvature around the leaf perimeter). As shown in Figure2(j,k), the late stage leaves of aux1/lax1/lax2 plants had statistically significantly lower values for these parameters compared with WT leaves, consistent with a smoother, less serrated shape.. Previous work established that PIN1 and CUC2 play a major role in serration formation, with PIN protein localization indicating auxin flux towards presumptive serration tips and CUC2 accumulation indicating intervening sinuses (Bilsborough etal., 2011). An examination of PIN1 and CUC2 expression using ProPIN1:PIN1-GFP, ProCUC2:CUC2-RFP and ProCUC2:GUS transgenes revealed no differences in the expression patterns of these proteins in the quad mutant compared to WT (Figure3). Thus, although the final extent of serration growth was less in the quad mutant, the patterning process was comparable in both the WT and quad mutant background. Thus, whenever a serration formed along the margin, the position of the serration outgrowth was defined by PIN1 orientation on the flank of the presumptive outgrowth pointing towards the lobe tip, both in the WT (Figure3a,b) and the quad mutant (Figure3g,h). Similarly, CUC2 expression was elevated in the sinuses between serrations in both WT (Figure3c-f) and quad mutant leaves (Figure3i-l), as visualized using RFP (Figure3c,d,i,j) and GUS (Figure3e,f,k,l) reporter gene lines. With respect to ProDR5:GUS expression, in the early stages of primordium development of quad plants, the signal was apparent at the tip of the leaf (Figure3m), and, as development proceeded, signals appeared later along the flanks of the primordia, but only as serrations were formed (Figure3o), and the signal was broader and weaker compared with the WT expression pattern (Figure1d). LAX1 promoter activity was still high at the tips of early and mid-stage primordia in the quad background (Figure3q,r) and in regions of serration tip formation (Figure3s), comparable to the pattern observed in WT (Figure3t), although the altered growth rate of tissues in the various genetic backgrounds resulted in different absolute distances of peak formation. Investigation of LAX2 expression in the quad background showed that the pattern of gene expression was similar to that observed in WT leaves at equivalent developmental stages, with LAX2 expression being initially constrained towards the distal leaf tip but excluded from the outer cell layers of the margin at all stages of development (Figure3u-x).. .

(a-l) Expression patterns of ProPIN. 1:GFP (a,b,g,h), ProCUC. 2:RFP (c,d,i,j) and ProCUC. 2:GUS (e,f,k,l) in serrations forming on the margin of WT (a-f) and quadruple aux1/lax mutant (quad) leaves (g-l) at various stages of serration formation. In (a,b,g,h), arrowheads indicate the tip of early-stage serrations. In (c,d,i,j), arrowheads indicate the sinus between serration outgrowths. The ProPIN. 1:GFP signal is asymmetrically localized in cells, suggesting a flow of auxin towards the tip of serrations, whereas CUC2 expression is localized within the sinuses of serrations in both genetic backgrounds.. (m-p) ProDR. 5:GUS expression (blue) in the quad mutant background at the early-stage (m) and mid-stage (n) of leaf 5 development was observed at the tip of the primordium, and, at a later stage of development (o), at the tip of serrations. ProDR. 5:GUS expression in WT is shown for comparison (p).. (q-t) Analysis of ProLAX. 1:GUS leaves shows a comparable expression pattern at the leaf tip during the early-stage (q) and mid-stage (r) of development, with signal (blue) also apparent within the serrations that form later in development of the quad leaves (s) compared to WT (t)..

Arrows in (p), (t) and (x) indicate small serrations. Exemplar images are shown from the analysis of at least six independent plants for each reporter gene construct in each genetic background. Scale bars=50mum (a-m,r,v), 100mum (n,r,v) and 80mum (o,p,s,t,w,x).. . . . In addition to the use of mutants, auxin transport may be manipulated by exogenous supply of inhibitors, and previous reports indicated that treatment of Arabidopsis plants with NPA (N-1-Naphthyphthalamic acid) leads to a smoother leaf margin (Mattsson etal., 2003). Control plants showed a normal pattern of serration during development, with PDR5:GUS expression at the primordium tip (Figure4a), at the tips of serrations and in portions of an internal network (Figure4b,c). When NPA was supplied to plants at 1mum, serration was inhibited in a manner similar to that described for the aux1/lax1/lax2 and quad mutants (i.e. serration still occurred and was still restricted to the base of the leaf, but it occurred later than in the untreated control leaves) (Figure4d-l). Analysis of ProDR5::GUS expression in NPA-treated leaves indicated the presence of an appropriate pattern of auxin maxima at the presumptive tips of serrations but with decreased signal intensity (Figure4d-f). After NPA treatment, LAX1 gene expression occurred at the tips of serrations, although, as described above, these serrations were less pronounced than in non-treated leaves (Figure4g-i). The pattern of LAX2 gene expression in NPA-treated leaves was similar to that observed in control leaves, being restricted towards the distal region of the leaf and excluded from the outer cell layers (Figure4j-l).. .

Modelling the role of auxin importers in the leaf margin. To further explore how the patterns of AUX1/LAX gene expression relate to the observed phenotypes, we used a modelling approach. Our initial model (model variant A) was adapted from that described by Bilsborough etal. (2011) but modified to include rules based on the AUX1/LAX gene expression patterns reported above and in the literature, and simplified with respect to assumptions regarding PIN localization. As shown in Figure5, we first introduced a positive feedback loop of auxin import linked to the local auxin concentration, representing both the observed correlation of LAX1 expression with regions of localized DR5 expression along the leaf margin and other data suggesting a link between auxin import and auxin levels (Heisler and Jonsson, 2006). Second, we imposed a drain of auxin from margin cells in a region symmetrically positioned around the leaf distal tip to simulate the outcome of the observed initial localization of LAX2 expression in a distally located sub-epidermal region of the leaf during the early stages of leaf growth. Third, we set an initially uniform auxin import rate setalong the entire perimeter to reflect the observed AUX1 expression pattern at the early stage of primordium formation. Details of this model are described in Model S1.. . Figure 5. . . AUX/PAT/CUC2 model for margin patterning.. The concentration of auxin regulates the localization of PIN auxin exporters within a cell, directing them to either the left or right border using an up the gradient rule with respect to neighbouring cells. The process by which auxin modulates PIN localization is modulated by the CUC2 transcription factor, the level of which is inversely correlated with auxin level. The level of LAX1 is positively regulated by the level of auxin, which is itself positively regulated by the LAX1 level in a positive feedback loop. Auxin is drained from the system by LAX2, and this drain is counteracted by auxin influx via AUX1. Details of the model are provided in Model S1. Items in black represent the model parameters included in the original model (Bilsborough etal., 2011), and the items in red indicate the new parameters included in the AUX/PAT/CUC2 model.. . . . The outputs of the model are displayed as space/time plots (Figure6). In these plots, the leaf margin is represented as a line of cells with the margin extremities at the top and bottom of the y axis and the distal tip, equivalent to the margin mid-point, located at the mid-point of the y axis (cell 50). Auxin concentration is depicted as a colour spectrum, with maxima indicated by regions of bright yellow and troughs as dark blue. As in the original model, we make the assumption that a local gradient in auxin level is somehow read out by the cells in that region as a gradient in growth response, leading to initiation of morphogenesis (i.e. serration). The extent of growth (i.e. serration size) is not explicitly modelled, but is assumed to be proportional to the integrated level of auxin.. . Figure 6. . Analysis of the AUX/PAT/CUC2 model.. Space/time displays of auxin levels as output of an AUX/PAT/CUC2 model in which the leaf margin is depicted as a row of cells (y axis) with the extremities of the margin at cell1 and cell100 and the distal tip of the leaf margin at cell50. Auxin level is indicated by a spectrum of colour from low (blue) to high (yellow).. (a) The basic model in which auxin peaks are restricted to the margin periphery and excluded from the central region of the margin. Auxin peaks initiate at time point 2.5, with the last peak initiating at time point 5.. (b,c) A lax1 mutant model (b) and an aux1 mutant model (c) in which the overall pattern of auxin peaks (both in space and time) remains similar to that shown in (a).. (d) Loss of LAX2 leads to the emergence of auxin peaks along the entire margin and a delay in formation of the first auxin peak.. (e) In the aux1/lax1/lax2 mutant model, auxin peaks occur along the entire margin, but the emergence of the auxin pattern is greatly delayed.. (f) A modified version of the model shown in (a) in which an auxin sensitivity window is imposed, indicated by the translucent blue coloration. Loss of auxin sensitivity occurs first at the most distal margin cell (cell50) at time point 2. Over subsequent iterations, an adjacent margin cell loses auxin sensitivity, leading to linear loss of auxin sensitivity over time until all margin cells become insensitive to auxin by time point 10.. (g-j) Introduction of the auxin sensitivity window to the model for mutant lax1 (g), aux1 (h), lax2 (i) and aux1/lax1/lax2 (j). In some cases (g,h,i), auxin peaks emerge for a distinct period before the loss of auxin sensitivity, whereas in others (j), auxin peaks occur for only a brief period before auxin sensitivity is lost. If the integral of auxin level (yellow peak value) is proportional to local growth, then the models lead to differential serration growth.. . . . This model generates a symmetrical pattern along the perimeter with alternating peaks and troughs of auxin level (Figure6a). The expression of LAX2 around the leaf tip drains auxin away from the margin in this region, ensuring that no auxin maxima are formed. This is predicted to lead to a lack of serrations in this region, as observed in WT Arabidopsis leaves (Figure2d,g). Interestingly, the LAX2-defined drain generates an internal boundary within the margin, and, as a consequence, peaks of auxin form in a temporal sequence, with peaks towards the leaf tip occurring before peaks at the leaf base. Thus the first auxin peak forms at approximately time point 2.5, and the last auxin maximum occurs at approximately time point 5. This reproduces the situation observed in real leaves, in which serration occurs with a pronounced distal-to-proximal temporal pattern.. The model presented in Figure6(a) captured some elements of margin patterning that were not apparent in the original model. The precise timing of peak occurrence and the relative intensity of the peaks depended on the values given to the various parameters, but the basic output (lack of peaks in the distal region and the temporal sequence of peak formation from distal to proximal region) was consistent. The model did not automatically generate a peak of auxin at the distal tip of the leaf, but analysis of auxin-response constructs in transgenic plants consistently indicates that this is present (Mattsson etal., 2003). A significant body of evidence suggests that this initial peak of auxin signalling is intrinsically linked to the process of leaf initiation, i.e. it is already set within the leaf at formation (Reinhardt etal., 2003). Although we imposed this central auxin peak within early versions of our model, we found that its presence had little effect on subsequent model behaviour, so, for simplicity, it is not included in the variants shown.. To investigate how well the model captures the phenotypes observed in mutants, we explored the outcome of removal of components of the model. As shown in Figure6(b,c), removal of either the LAX1 or AUX1 components had relatively little effect on model output for each parameter set. Patterning was slightly delayed in the proximal regions of the margin compared with the WT model (Figure6a), but the distribution and timing of auxin peak formation was essentially unchanged. This relatively limited outcome of removal of the LAX1 and AUX1 components was consistent with the observed lax1 or aux1 single mutations, in which no obvious change in serration was observed. However, when LAX2 was removed from the model (as shown in Figure6d for the lax2 mutant and Figure6e for the aux1/lax1/lax2 mutant), a fundamental change in patterning occurred. First, and most obviously, auxin peaks were predicted to occur throughout the margin, including the distal region. This would lead to serration being initiated in the distal leaf margin, but this phenotype was never observed in the lax2 or aux1/lax1/lax2 mutant leaves. Another consequence of the loss of LAX2, which was most apparent in the aux1/lax1/lax2 mutant model and to a lesser extent in the lax2 model, was that the time taken for auxin patterning to be established was greatly delayed (Figure6d,e). Again, the absolute time taken for peaks to emerge depended on the parameters used, but the results were consistent for each set of parameters explored. Thus, in the lax2 mutant model shown in Figure6(d), auxin peaks occurred uniformly at approximately time point 5, and, in the aux1/lax1/lax2 mutant model (Figure6e), auxin peaks did not arise until approximately time point 7, much later than the slowest-forming auxin peaks in the WT and lax2 models (Figure6a).. . . Reconciling model and reality: exploring the roles of auxin sensitivity and leaf growth rate. The model described above has a major discrepancy with respect to one aspect of the biological phenotype observed. In reality, mutants containing lax2 do not form serrations in the distal region of the leaf. To investigate the possible reason for this discrepancy, we considered the potential role of altered auxin sensitivity during development. It is noteworthy that differentiation of margin cells is one of the earliest observable events in leaf development, and, moreover, that it occurs in a temporal wave from the distal tip towards the proximal regions of the margin (Reinhardt etal., 2007). Whether this overt early margin differentiation is linked to altered auxin sensitivity is unknown, but links between auxin signalling and the cell cycle are well-established (Menges etal., 2005; De Veylder etal., 2007; Jurado etal., 2010). To explore this idea, we imposed a temporal wave of auxin insensitivity on the models described in Figure6(a-e) (model variant B). The outputs shown in Figure6(f-j) provide examples based on the assumption of a simple linear loss of auxin sensitivity with time, starting at the most distal (tip) margin cell at time point 2 and progressing towards the proximal region at a set rate such that the entire margin becomes insensitive with respect to the auxin patterning system by time point 10. This pattern of sensitivity loss is clearly arbitrary, but serves as an example of the type of outputs that may result from such sensitivity windows.. For the WT, lax1 and aux1 models, the outputs are very similar after imposition of the auxin sensitivity window (Figure6f-h). If the assumption is made that growth of the resulting serrations depends on the integrated level of auxin over time within any one peak before sensitivity is lost, then the relative size and position of peaks would be similar, as observed in reality. When a sensitivity window is included in the model for the lax2 mutant (Figure6i), peaks of auxin are also still formed in the proximal regions of the margin ahead of the wave of auxin insensitivity in positions similar to WT, such that absolute peak number and position are conserved. The integrated level of auxin within a peak is less than in themodel outputs shown in Figure6(f-h), and therefore the serration growth is predicted to be less in this mutant than in WT or the other single mutants, although the degree of difference depends on the parameter values set. In the aux1/lax1/lax2 mutant model (Figure6j), the loss of all auxin importer activity results in most of the margin losing auxin sensitivity before auxin peaks are established, leading to integrated auxin peak levels being very small (although they still occur in the appropriate positions). Again, if the assumption is made that serration growth depends on the integral of auxin level at a position on the margin, it may be predicted that serration in this mutant still occurs but that the serrations would be much smaller, as indeed observed in the triple and quadruple mutants.. Addition of NPA (auxin transport inhibition) to the model without the sensitivity window led to a similar output to that observed for the quad mutant (FigureS2A versus Figure6e) with the effect depending on the degree to which the transport system was inhibited (equivalent to the concentration of NPA supplied to the tissue) (FigureS2B,C). Incorporation of the auxin sensitivity window meant that there was still potential for auxin peaks to form for a brief time towards the margin periphery (thus some degree of serration) (FigureS2D), or, if auxin transport was severely inhibited (equivalent to very high levels of NPA), total loss of auxin patterning along the leaf margin (FigureS2E,F). Again, if serration growth is related to the integral of the auxin peak level before the loss of auxin sensitivity, the final serration size will be decreased as a result of NPA treatment.. . . Testing the model reveals a role for margin-localized auxin signal transduction in blade/petiole growth. The model developed above introduces a potential role of changing auxin sensitivity in serration formation and growth. To test this hypothesis, we used a previously characterized enhancer trap line (E1439) that drives expression of target genes in a dynamic fashion to the leaf margin (Reinhardt etal., 2007). Expression first occurs in the distal margin, and then extends around the complete margin and petiole as the leaf develops (Figure7a). We used the E1439 line to drive expression of a gain-of-function mutation in axr3-1 (IAA17). This Aux/IAA protein has been shown to alter various plant responses to auxin, although the precise nature of the downstream process (in terms of increased or decreased auxin sensitivity) is complex and is likely to be context-dependent (Leyser etal., 1996; Perez-Perez etal., 2010). The E1439>axr3-1 plants displayed an unexpected phenotype at the whole-organ level. The ratio of the petiole to leaf blade was increased, leading to rosettes with greatly elongated petioles and relatively narrow blades compared with control UAS::axr3-1 plants (Figure7b,c). Quantitative analysis of various leaf size parameters (Figure7g) confirmed this visual impression, with E1439>axr3-1 leaves having a significant (P<0.01) increase in petiole length. There was also a change in blade shape, with E1439>axr3-1 blades being relatively more elongated than the controls. Nevertheless, serrations did form on the E1439>axr3-1 leaves, with the pattern of serration being comparable to that of WT leaves (Figure7d-f).. . Figure 7. . Testing the role of auxin signalling in the leaf margin.. (a) E1439 drives GFP and target gene expression to the leaf margin and petiole..

(g) Quantification of petiole and blade size of leaves from E1439>axr3-1 plants and control UAS::axr3-1 plants, revealing differences in size and form. The results are shown for experiments performed with three independent lines of E1439>axr3-1 (LN1, LN2, LN3), and the progeny of three crosses of UAS::axr3-1 plants with Col-0 WT plants. Mean values for the parameters measured (blade length and width, petiole length) are shown, with measurements from leaves of 12 individual plants in each case. A Student's ttest comparing petiole length in E1439>axr3-1 versus UAS::axr3-1 leaves indicated a significant difference (P<0.01) (n=3)..
